The Cubinder
is a verse that is shaped like a
cubinder
, being the reason it is named like one. Like
the Tesseracts
, it is constructed from the
archreality
of the archreality of the archreality of the archreality... of a verse and even more than that for the Cubinder.
Construction
[
]
Like previously said, the Cubinder is constructed from repeated archrealities of The Tesseract, but how many, exactly? It turns out that there is actually
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
layers of archrealities until you get to The Cubinder, a.k.a
R
The Tesseract
Ω
{\displaystyle R^\Omega_\text{The Tesseract}}
. This gives us a shape called a cubinder, which is the cylinder of a cylinder.
Like The Tesseract, the part of The Cubinder that actually has The Cubinder in it is not most of the verse, because most of it is actually a hypercylindrical shell. The Cubinder that we recognize is actually only in the very middle of The Cubinder, and because of laws in the verse it moves up and down inside the actual Cubinder.
