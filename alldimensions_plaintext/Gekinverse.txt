The Gekinverse
is a verse who is actually It is full of "irregularities" well said all Omega Platonic Concepts. Being its scale even larger than First Aleph-Fixed Point. And reaching a beyond absolute infinity in a greater plane scale. (Beyond than usual Conceptual level and unimaginability) but still not getting out of the fictional point but still unimaginable. Well, the first things that can be found in this verses are the particles "PF" [pre-fiction] which are basically only visible in this verse and are invisible in other places for the entities that are considered or are or exist in a Fiction plane, these particles form these scenarios and are omnipresent in all fictional scenarios, they can be absorbed and grant an improvement "Night-True Omnipotence" it must be clarified that they can only be absorbed or views that form all the fiction, In the Gekinverse there are about 350 ···· (and other million five hundred trillions of particles digits), and the more consumed improves. But few entities can absorb more than two. No OMNI-GOD can. This verse is completely inaccessible to fictional entities. And this out of the base of the whole. (But not outside the fiction and is visible on a page still)
