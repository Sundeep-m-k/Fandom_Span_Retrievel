Yes, there are numerous types of stars out there. Some of them are large, while others are small. Welcome to Stellar Classification! It will have numerous amount of real and fake stars!

A
Y-Type star
is the dimmest that a star can get, but it isn't actually a star. This is possibly the first stage that a star will form, but then it will be a protostar called. And then if it fails to form a brighter brown dwarf, it will eventually be classified as a Y-Type. It is somewhere between a very large planet and a very small brown dwarf, since the temperature is cold. Its mass would be under 13 Jupiter masses, if it is under 1 Jupiter mass. It will dwarf itself into a FS-Type. Its color could be a very dark one, but it isn't actually a black dwarf. It's temperature would be under 1000 K, because this is so icy cold for a star.
T-Type

A T-Type star is alot more brighter than a Y-Type but still not enough to form a star, actually it is a fully brown dwarf that is not that brown. But more likely red. It is alot more warmer now since it is now 1000K. It is still cold but it is a finished Y-Type and then a T-Type is born. It's mass is 13 times as Jupiter.
L-Type

A L-Type star is still a brown dwarf, but enough mass to become a soon-to-be star. It is 1750K since this is enough warm to be a Red Dwarf, which is a M-Type. The mass is 65 times as massive as Jupiter, as you can see. It is startng to be brighter, it leaves it's T-Tauri stage and goes on powering nuclear fusion. It is going to be weak since it isn't massive enough.
