The
Tujǣvƕƽverse
, or
UNI-1445
, is a
verse
in a
multiverse
, that is also a
Kaoverse
. The Tujǣvƕƽverse is made up of matter in two quarters opposing each other diagonally, with the rest being mostly complete void, with an occasional galaxy or star rarely able to be found.
The
Kaoverse
property of the Tujǣvƕƽverse holds up to about 16 orders of magnitude.
Other than its status as a Kaoverse, it is a perfectly normal
universe
.
The ƍƛṵeƹ - ǷƺaƔẋ
[
]
The ƍƛṵeƹ - ǷƺaƔẋ are the most dominant species of the Tujǣvƕƽverse. They are where the name of the Tujǣvƕƽverse came from, and are a Kardashev 3.4 civilization. They (other than civilization who developed on cosmic bodies in the void) were one of the first native species to find that the Tujǣvƕƽverse was half-void, half-cosmic web by doing sky surveys around their home galaxy (the galaxy was near the hypercenter of the verse) in 881 ɏⱧ (766

)

.
When the ƍƛṵeƹ - ǷƺaƔẋ developed WFTL
[

]
technology in 1274 ɏⱧ, they were able to confirm, without a doubt, that the Tujǣvƕƽverse was half-&-half cosmic web and void. Upon more advanced creatures entering the Tujǣvƕƽverse, the ƍƛṵeƹ - ǷƺaƔẋ was connected with post-
Universe
things, and ambassador ƍƛṵeƹ - ǷƺaƔẋ creatures learned about the Tujǣvƕƽverse's special status as a
Kaoverse
.
Eventually, the whole of the Tujǣvƕƽverse was connected with post-
Universe
things (approximate date being 4319 ɏⱧ), and the inhabitants as a whole learned about the
Kaoverse
. The ƍƛṵeƹ - ǷƺaƔẋ, as they stand today, are an important part of post-universe affairs.

ɏⱧ, short for ɏỂnaⱮ ⱧƊuƢv, is the year equivalent for the ƍƛṵeƹ - ǷƺaƔẋ. One ɏⱧ is about 0.09

WFTL means Way Faster Than Light, an informal term for things that are able to travel faster than one light year per second
