Fights

Fights I and II
[
]
The Entity fought FireWater, and instantaneously won the fight against him. He continued to keep destroying the Universe, until FireWater escaped from them and had attempted a rematch. The power of the two when FireWater was enraged were almost equal, but the Entity was still slightly more powerful. However, this difference was very small, so they both fell, and both retreated to regenerate for later.
Fights III and IV
[
]
FireWater and the Entity fought again after one billion years of regeneration. The fight came close, but the Entity won again. To prevent fighting in the future, the Entity gave FireWater another chance to live, but he had to be corrupted for one million years and become his minion. He accepted, granting him more power than he ever had before. A friend of FireWater came to release him after a million years of being with the Entity. The friend was not going to win, but he was still let go, as the Entity would need to spend time regenerating.

It is unknown exactly what the Entity is doing in modern time. It is likely that they are continuing to regenerate from battle, and destroying more than ever before. It is definite that the Entity wants to get revenge onto anyone who has wronged him, specifically FireWater.
