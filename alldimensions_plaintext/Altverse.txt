Altverses
are special verses that can be manipulated and turned into a specific type of verse, such as
Universes
,
Multiverses
, or any other type of verse smaller than an
Alphasm
. Altverses can be considered the default verse, due to almost every verse in the hierarchy being made from an Altverse, including
Protoverses
. Altverses exist in all dimensions so that all creatures can interact and manipulate it.

Creation

]
Altverses are usually imagined and created by an Alphasm, as they use these verses to construct verses from
the Official Hierarchy
and their entire imaginary worlds.
