Thuons are
elementary particles
which are distant cousins of
electrons
. They are an optional particle that can be used to create
atoms
. Atoms with thuons in their composition are referred to as thuonic atoms, and have a thuonic shell that extends out 1,000× the distance of the electron shell. Thuons can change the properties of atoms, and originate new elements. They are most commonly represented with the Icelandic / Old English letter Thorn (þ), which is used for the "th" sound.

Geometry Warping
[
]
Thuonic elements regularly have some geometry-warping properties, such as spherical, hyperbolic or other geometries. These effects are normally very subtle, but get more noticeable when the concentration of thuons increases.
Thuon Stars
[
]
This is one of the most extreme cases of the geometry warping capability of thuons. These stars are made almost exclusively of thuons, and get their energy from thuon collisions:
Thuon collisions happen when two thuons meet each other at high speeds, and it releases a
Primordium Sigma
particle, a positron, and some energy.
Thuon Stars aren't actually spheres as the way we think of them, but hyperbolic holospheres, which means they are infinite planes.

Thuonic Elements
[
]
Thuonic elements have various peculiar properties. Here are a list of some of them, in order of discovery.
The symbols of thuonic elements always have "þ-" preceding it, which allows symbols from already existing elements to be used (such as Uranium's U or Phosphorus's P).

Nanopicture of an unobtanium crystal.
Has an insane durability (being a 26 on the Mohs Scale).
Has a hyperbolic crystal pattern.
Despite its hardness, can be dissolved using
cuandaic
acid.
Pulvigen
Means "generates dust"
Pulvi-: dust
-gen: Generates

Pulvigen rock in a vacuum.
Opposite of unobtanium - turns instantly into tiny grains when exposed to any gas, including air, only being able to survive in big chunks in a vacuum.
However, its alloys are insanely strong, almost that of unobtanium.
