About
[
]
The
DDonuts
are very large
verses
, resembling the
Earth
. However, they're donut-shaped instead.
Donut omniprescence
[
]
In fact, everything on the DDonuts is donut-shaped, just like the verses themselves. For example, the
entities
, structures, landscapes, etc. are all donut-shaped. Even their most basic components (such as
quarks
,
leptons
, and the like) have this one specific shape.

]
The similarities of the DDonuts with Earth aren't only related to their appearance, though. They even share similar entities. They're inhabited by dohumans and doanimals, whicy are proportional to their DDonut's size, and, as such, are absolutely massive. Every person that exists or not on Earth has a donut version of themselves, which do the exact same things and go through the exact same events as they do.
Spherical core
[
]
The hole of the DDonuts contains an invisible yet extremely large sphere. It contains the smaller verses, such as the
Bignoseverses
. The sphere itself is very hard to penetrate, and entering or exiting it is difficult. It can, however, be done, and many
civilizations
offer transport between the inside and outside of the sphere.
