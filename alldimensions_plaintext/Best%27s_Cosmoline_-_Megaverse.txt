The
megaverse
in Best's Cosmoline is a structure where many MANY
Multiverses
orbit 8-dimensionally around a
Superverse
in the center, going approximately 8,771,474,922,266,022,788.135 Ly every second, going faster than even the
Glitchyverse
. That means that a multiverse 50Sx Ly away from the Superverse would orbit around twice in only 365 DAYS!
Light would not stand a CHANCE in a race against a multiverse orbiting a superverse, but there is a strange property in these verses where light stays binded to it's position in these verses, thus causing light not to blow STRAIGHT to the edge of the multiverse within not even a MILLISECOND. We do not know how the megaverse works like this, but it just does it by itself because it is just created to be the way it is.
