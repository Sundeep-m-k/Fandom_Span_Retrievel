Pure Nothingness is one of the most powerful voids, because it is only 0.00001% matter, and the 'matter' is just letters. Fill in the void by

The end of
The Container Of All Imagination
which pure nothingness has a wall, but extremely dense, that almost nothing can get through it.
Pure Nothingness is a no other than nothing itself. The average 'nothing' contained within this is about twice the size as
Everything Layer
. The smallest however is G64
++^
smaller than
The Smallest
. The biggest is really the 'Pure Nothingness' as it contains not only big voids, but phases of
The Uber Box
as creations bigger than the one, and smaller, or as the same size. The smallest 'nothing' just breaks all laws of physics and space.
Type 5
The Tables Concerning the boundary of pure nothingness.
(The Heart is a bigger type 5 which is located with the word and number, 'Type 5'.)
The tables show a box of pure nothingness compared to an object called 'The Heart'. The Heart is some sort of shape like 'A heart'. It is infinite
+Ω
bigger than pure nothingness, which is literally impossible, but its like that. Lets get to talking about pure nothingness though. Its a Supreme void which contains numbers finite and infinite, though however, the following 'Null Number Of Infinity' from 'The Publishers Conclusion' Can easily destroy this, since its 'thought' to be bigger than infinite, so thats how it works.

jj
Another word for pure nothingness which means 'Jemesty Joline'
Estimated to be a dimension full of these words.
It contains True Nothing as it is one of another 'nothings'
The end of the pure nothingness is just a word saying 'NOTHING' but there can be something beyond it.
Gallery of Pure Nothingness.
This is the Pure Nothingness, Which its true version of it is the same as this but a little distorted and more animated, which a dark aura of a ring is around it.

The Heart in its position expanding in size for the laws and rules of it.
This is one of the biggest things on the wiki, but since were doing beyond beyond, then its  B e y o n d  B e y o n d   to be one of the
V e r s e s
. Sounds in here are put in the secret files within those being:
Weird sound effects coming from the radiation of the true version of Pure Nothingness
Pure Nothingness is slowly devouring itself to only be bigger in a critical state, which has multiple sounds
the black hole in the realm is constantly pulling other verses to it, not one at a time, but many of them. distorted sounds.
The graph of Pure Nothingness compared to The Heart is not known to this day, but we know that The Heart is stupidly bigger than it, making a type of deep sewer sound on the outside if you ever went there.
Any more 'pages' that go in this will make a beep, and used as information.
There are just more used to this realm, and much detail about it. Edit here if you spot something.
This is remembered to be a Cosmic Microwave Background, until it had revealed to the truth and became this beyond menace. As remembered, it has too much boundaries that you would get torn apart if you tried to leave here, but not die as it has matters of them.
Pathway
This graph shows 'True Pure Nothingness' by its pathway.
Its table stays the same as the wiki put in this like. But this is because there are multiples of pure nothingness that have duplicated multiple times and stay the same size, by expanding faster than the speed of light standing still. If you used the 'White And Black' term of composite and prime feature, it can fit with many of the black and white nothings behind and behind to where you see the shape of Pure Nothingness.
Prime and composite is whats used in this dark novel by any underestimate of its shape. It has waited there forever, and had its part sides between the core of beyond infinity or a typical universe that is considered a 'nothing' as it is. Speaking of the Pure Nothingness, It sometimes has a shell that increases the shape point of any dimension whatsoever.

The realm of Pure Nothingness is corrected to be something beyond our thoughts. The same goes to
The Container Of All Imagination
, but we understand in 'this' usage in terms of the wikis point. We can see whats inside it with many objects to explore, and possible unknown to points of majority.

is
a special recipe for Pure Nothingness.
The MegaBerryVerse is special for Pure Nothingness. It contributes every dark matter it needs for living. If anyone tried to destroy this, they cant, because the dark matter will flow against them, and bring them to a black hole of the Pure Nothingness. Its very sure that the matter is living forever and on. The light is the Pure Nothingness is so strong, It can admit light from its black holes.
Sometimes, Pure Nothingness can shape and detail like our universe of far away. Below here is a uncountable extend of the 'Pure" of the nothingness.

Therefore, you cant really figure out this number. This number contains any 'Rayo's Number' with itself. As clear as it is, its too intense for a mind to grasp it. This factor will extend on for more, and will make a big difference to any verses. This math order continues to stay on expanding its front, and ways to be its own knowledge. Yes, it is what they want for us to see whats here in the past.
The MathSort's of Pure Nothingness continues in numbers and order and all types of domains, back and fourth.
