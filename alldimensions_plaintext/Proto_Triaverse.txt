The proto Triaverse is the earliest version of the
Triaverse
. This version is the simplest version. This version has almost had no storage, at least 135 kilobytes. It has nothing inside of it except for strings of code floating around.
Outer shell
[
]
To stop the code from freely roaming the Creators had to code in an outer shell to prevent the code from leaving. Once code leaves assets start to be deleted. Since the storage was limited, they had to use what they could to make the outer shell possible, causing the outer shell to be spaced apart.
The inside
[
]
Inside the universe you can notice that everything is black. If your eyes are powerful enough, you can notice very small strings of code moving around, the code is constantly changing Aswell. Glitches are not that common for some reason.
Glitches
[
]
When glitches happen the outer shell disappears and 50% of the code is gone. the 50% of code has a 0.9% chance of being deleted if that happens Proto Triaverse will disappear from the code.
