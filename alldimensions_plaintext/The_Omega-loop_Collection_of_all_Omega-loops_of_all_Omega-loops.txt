This is the space around the
The Omega-loop of all Omega-loops
, having 10³²¹²
Omega-loops of all Omega-loops
randomly scattered around, but they are too small.
Each
Omega-loop of all Omega-loops
have different sizes. The biggest one is called "Giantomega" and the smallest one being "Omega-looped atom of all Omega-loops". Their other info and images are unknown. Also our local one is "Omega-looped planet of all Omega-loops", but its unknown too, because i dont think someone got there, due to getting to the
Final Omega Portal
so you can get to
The Omega Collection
taking eternities
Contains:
Omega-loop of all Omega-loops
Contained by: The Final Omega-loop
Also for people who think my pages are bad im at least trying
The Omega-loop Collection of all Omega-loops of all Omega-loops
A 3D projection of The Omega-loop Collection of all Omega-loops of all Omega-loops.
Smallest object it can see
Every of the Omega-loops of all Omega-loops are too small compared to this so you cant see them
