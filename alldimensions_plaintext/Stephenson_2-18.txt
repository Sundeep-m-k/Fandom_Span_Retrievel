Size comparison with VY Canis Majoris
Stephenson 2-18, also known as RSGC2-18 and Stephenson 2 DFK 1, is a red supergiant
star
in the Stephenson 2 supercluster, in the Scutum constellation, about 20,000 light years or 6,000 parsecs away and it is located near the Supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A. The star is extremely large, having a gigantic diameter of nearly 2150 times the diameter of the
Sun
, and it is probably approaching the potential largest size of Red Supergiant
stars
and probably is one of the largest
stars
in the
Universe
.

Size
[
]
Stephenson 2-18 was one thought as being one of the largest, if not the current largest star ever discovered at the time, surpassing other stars like VY Canis Majoris and
UY Scuti
. Stephenson 2-18 was estimated to have a radius of 2,150 solar radii, being larger than almost the entire orbit of
Saturn
(1,940 - 2,169 solar radii). Using that estimate, this
Star
is estimated to have a volume of at least 10 billion times that of the
Sun
. By comparison to this star, the
Sun
is pretty much the size size of a grain of dust, in comparison to a very big basketball. The star is probably approaching the potential largest size of Red Supergiant stars, however, this estimate of Stephenson 2-18’s size is possibly inaccurate, and should be taken with a grain of salt.
Mass
[
]
Stephenson 2-18's mass is Unknown. Currently, Stephenson 2-18 fuses helium into heavier elements like lithium and carbon, burning through more and more mass.  Stephenson 2-18 likely lost large amounts of it's mass of it's massive size as a Red Supergiant star. As Stephenson 2-18 continues to burn elements in it's core, it will die eventually, giving it's mass back to the
Galaxy
. This mass will create new
stars
and
planets
.
Luminosity
[
]
Stephenson 2-18, alongside with size, is also one of the most luminous stars, at 440,000 units of solar luminosity. (Solar luminosity means luminosity of the
Sun
).  Stephenson 2-18 has big luminosity, as Red Supergiant
stars
are some of the most luminous and largest stars in the
Universe
. The average temperature of Stephenson 2-18 is 3,200 kelvin, however, this estimate is near the limit for red supergiant luminosity.
