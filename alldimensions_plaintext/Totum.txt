Note from KVD11:
hello there. I'd like you to know this is a megacollab page, which means anyone can contribute. Although, if you wanted to fundamentally change a large part of this article/Totum's properties, please ask me here:
my message wall
. For right now adding is fine.
Totum

Totum
("Whole" in Latin) is a verse, being "beyond-existence". Its true name is unknown, so the one this article uses was only given due to its properties. Totum contains everything that was made before it, (including
Final fractalism
) and apparently, it was made by a
Paradox Civilization
by harvesting paradox logic, and is used for extending observability drastically.
Totum contains the entirety of final fractalism via said paradox logic.
This is also the point where cosmic entities end, and a new kind of entities arise named
TransObservable
(This part is to be extended)
hello TheHolderofTheDarkheartandTheIllumina here I just wanna say that, what is paradox logic

Trivia
[
]
Other entities have given different names to the Totum. WE are the ones using that name, but thats not the case for everyone else. Some examples of other names given to this verse are big chungus, >, ETC, BLA BLA, enies toink, etc.
The name "Totum" was coined by NonUseable which is what the page uses.
WIP, please read the note above if you want to expand this.
