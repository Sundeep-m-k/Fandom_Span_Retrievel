Rainbow rotating DNAs
are structures that look similar in appareance to normal DNA except they're spinning and are rainbow. Each atom in a Rainbow rotating DNA contains about 6,000,000
Yellow Wekamultonic Geopamultons
, also there is 200 atoms in the GIF in the infobox. The full DNA is 1 trillion times longer than the section that is seen the GIF. The whole DNA contains an average of 1.2x10^18 Yellow Wekamultonic Geopamultons.
