About
[
]
The
Dark-Harbringer
is an
entity
that is aware that
TOGs
exist.
He usually does nothing but if he does do something, he is either hanging around or destroying or weakening something.
He also made some
entities
himself. He sometimes also takes care of his creations. Despite his name, he is more chaotic neutral than straight up evil.
It is possible that the corrupt creator made him.
