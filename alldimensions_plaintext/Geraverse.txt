Info
[
]
The Geraverse contains all of the
Gigaverses
. The reason that is possible even though Gigaverses are contained by another thing is because of the very strange
Metabubble
that the Geraverse is contained in. This metabubble is extremely corrupted and broken, leaving weird situations in where the Geraverse can directly contain the Gigaverses even though Gigaverses are directly contained by the Teraverse.
Appearance

The Geraverse appears to be larger than the
Teraverse
. That reason for that is because of the broken
Metabubble
.
