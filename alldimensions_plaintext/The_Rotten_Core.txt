Description of the Verse
[
]
When first going into The Rotten Core, the first thing you'll notice is an awful smell. This smell is universally considered terrible. The Rotten Core's is pitch black, so you will new a light source. Did I forget to mention The Rotten Core is highly toxic? Without a specialized suit, you'll die in a matter of moments after entering The Rotten Core. The ground feels mushy, and it is easy to accidentally sink into the ground. The wildlife here is highly dangerous due to evolving and adapting to The Rotten Core. Outside The Rotten Core, there's The Rotting Space, which is a massive void which only contains The Rotten Core. On top of how inhospitable The Rotten Core already is, The Rotten Core is also highly unstable. This instability can cause all sorts of random things to happen, including:
A mountain spontaneously forming, causing you to suffocate.
Being teleported far into The Rotting Space.
A very deep pit opening, causing you to fall forever.
Suddenly becoming unable to leave The Rotten Core.
Randomly warping into a creature's den.
And so many more "fun" and "exciting" things!
