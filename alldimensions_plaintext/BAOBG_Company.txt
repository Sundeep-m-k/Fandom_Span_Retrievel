The BAOBG Company is a major company on the
Betasm-Alphasm-Oni Megacity-Planet
. One of their headquarters is the
BAOBG Company Tower
In a major district of the planet/city. They also have a large presence on several planets and locations across the First
Everything Layer
, or at the very least doing their best to. The Company's origins are currently shrouded in mystery and even somewhat contradictory in nature. They have made themselves aware to and of entities such as
Oni
,
Pointlessly Omnipotent Worm
,
The Bat-GOD
as well as
Betasm
, and some others. Granted they have been quite busy and are doing their best to seemingly collect information and gain power as much as they can, there is a Singular mysterious CEO, however they are unknown to many, not really cosmic entities though they are not that powerful to conceal themselves from such beings if they wanted to find them, they could easily do so. They tend to be in the interest in gaining power throughout the planet and gaining influence which they have in significant quantities for example politically on the planet by influencing the planet's politicians such as
Donphason OniBaton (Betasm-Alphasm-Oni)
who was elected to the
Betasm-Oni-Jartos District (B-A-O-MCPV) ï¿¼
of the planet as a ruler of that planetary district  by endorsing him and attempting to give him cosmic powers which didn't go very well. Now that guy is imprisoned and is now imprisoned in
Prison 0101 of the Bat-GOD
. Another example is
Betaron Fridor (BAOMCPV)
of another district of the planet, who also knew Donphason and is trying to gain power currently. The BAOBG company is also gaining influence in entertainment, by purchasing all the movie studios and companies on the planet they can get ahold of. With this they could also influence the pop culture of the planet-city and they can use it for their own benefit.
