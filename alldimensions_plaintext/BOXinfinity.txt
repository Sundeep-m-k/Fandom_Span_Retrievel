BOXinfinity
is a box containing a bunch of other boxes, including
the Final Boxes
and
the Other Boxes
.
Some of the more important boxes, which are also of reasonable size, are kept here.
A couple of the boxes located inside of the BOXinfinity are similiar to the Box itself, except being the 1-finality equivalents for different existence ranks. They are, just like the Pseudo-Omniverses in the
Allomniverse
, smaller and less inhabited, but still significant enough and usefull to earn a spot in this box.
A few of the other boxes are just for structural value, for example, the Hilbert Box is an infinitely dimensional box containing a Hilbert curve that fills space in every natural dimension. The Hilbert curve is of finite order, and the curve houses a ton of civilizations both inside and outside.
