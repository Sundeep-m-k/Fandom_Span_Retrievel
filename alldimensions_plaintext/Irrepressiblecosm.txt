Irrepressiblecosm
or The Anti-Contained is the full collection of every depiction of the allsphere, What is "fiction"? Is it only our fiction? There is life out there, so what's their fiction? the Irrepressiblecosm is beyond all adjectives, verbs, and such and beyond in every single possible, impossible, languange, alphabet and more, The Irrepressiblecosm doesn't need to expand, it already is beyond that, even if you compressed all the
Allcubes
into 0.1 of a ‚ßàth of a infinith of a true nothing true and stacked that infinitely a infinite times, it still isn't close, and the Irrepressiblecosm holds things so beyond our imagination and beyond things beyond our imagination that it simply loses all meaning, as meaning even mattered, it has a Infinity so great it transcends infinity and greatness itself, even if you say "[Insert Name] is [insert exaltation] the Irrepressiblecosm" it still gets contained by The Irrepressiblecosm, The Irrepressiblecosm is beyond any exaltation and it's opposites, literally every sense of a
infium
and it's opposites are still defied and contained by the Irrepressiblecosm, that's why one of it's names is "The Unreachable" because is literally the end, even then it all loops back and back over and over again a infinite amount of times, The Irrepressiblecosm ends all that, 1 true nothing true of Irrepressiblecosm>>>>>>>>>>>EABAs, Because at this point, Conventional Rules of Logic and Reality start to break down and give up

Absolutely EVERYTHING and NOTHING and DREAMUMTHING Has their size multiplied so much that a Irrepressiblecosm True Nothing (True) is the size of a
True Multiverse
, How Huge is that?, even then a literal IRCM kitten would be larger than that, the Irrepressiblecosm is so beyond every infium in every sense,way, direction, dimension of the infiums so much that even if u stacked all the infiums together and multiplied them by the largest number ever multiple times with no end, it still will have the same result as the Allcubes, as nothing is everything and everything is nothing, paradoxes and it's opposites get defied by the Irrepressiblecosm, as it's beyond paradoxicality, The Irrepressiblecosm defies containment, and absolutely is beyond the concepts of concepts itself(or
True Concepts
) and all their opposites and every form of duality in every adjectives, verbs, nouns, literally in all versions of reality, even existence and non-existence, and even everything in this page is not even close as there are a infinite amount of infinite timelines that branch off to others which dictate every impossible and possible outcome so that means that there are All Dimensions Wikia that are beyond our AD however even all of these ADs combined and multiplied by the highest number of infinity ever, it still won't come close, Even infinity gets lost in the atoms of The Irrepressiblecosm, it is Absolutely Absolute, The True Allsphere doesn't even come close to this as Irrepressiblecosm is beyond anything written and unwritten, it's Unreachable by any unreachablity, True Concepts don't even come close, The True Concepts of Size, EUSI, Finality Index, FOEI, Dimensionality, Kardashev Scale are less than a
Ehaz
to The Irrepressiblecosm, it's the Embodiment of The End of All Things, the Finality of Verses, However since anything in the Irrepressiblecosm can have their size multiplied to a absurd amount, it means that everything, nothing,  
is alot higher than their original versions so even the smallest become the biggest,
