Overview
[

This void was discovered in the year 3012 during a routine space mission to search for space oddities.
Discovery
[
]
The lone world was discovered when a group of astronauts were assigned to go on a mission to locate any space oddities in the multiverse. after going 1 billion light years out things started to get incredibly dark, one of the astronauts who was a part of this mission (Who will not be named) noted that the space around them started changing colors going from blue to red and then black. Upon getting out one of the astronauts turned the spaceship around and took the photo that is in the info box.
In the year 3023 more astronauts came back to search the void after reports of stars disappearing from view. The people in the mission noticed that it had grown in size and was eating off of the matter around it.
Black hole?

After a little exploring the crew on the 3023 mission approached the core of the black hole, they had no idea that they were near it, around 40 minutes after the crew approaching the core, mission control couldn't see their location. Mission control made the decision that the crew got sucked in by the black hole in the core.
