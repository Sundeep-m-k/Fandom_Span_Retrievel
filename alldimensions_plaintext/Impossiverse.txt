Impossiverse
is not a verse, but it is a set contains concepts and existence in nesting subsets.
The set
[
]
All of the subsets must be in one grand set, which is the sum. The element can be either the subset, existence, non-existence, or concept. There are 2 types of subsets, the square brackets and curly brackets.
The square brackets have 2 to infinity elements, that the first element contains all other elements in the subset.
The curly brackets that if the first element exists in the cosmology, then the result is the second element, otherwise the third element.
