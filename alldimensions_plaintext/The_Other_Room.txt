Interesting Facts

1. The Other Room doesn't have a door. Instead, the top splits open when That Human wants to get out (which is never). It is yet unknown why The Other Room is designed like this
2. The Other Room is contained by
Defiled Universe
but has a powerful barrier around it that keeps it from being destroyed by the
Sproyongs
that are in Defiled Universe. The barrier is forcefield-like and has a red tint. However, the most integral part of this is a rogue
Thread
dangling from the centre of Defiled Universe. This Thread was placed here by That Human when he discovered that The Other Room was so close to such an unstable Verse, and it prevents any unauthorized changes to The Other Room’s essence.
3. The top and bottom of The Other Room are sealed with an extremely strong, adhesive tape. This tape keeps the top of The Other Room from opening every 10 seconds. Not even That Human can pull the tape out.
