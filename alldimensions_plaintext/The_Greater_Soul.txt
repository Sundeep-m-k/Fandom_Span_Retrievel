TGS is the creator of beem, well technically beem wasn't really created, beem just popped into existence with a thought, TGS is kinda a meta-physical being, transcending infinite hypothetical allspheres while at the expansion rate of the real one, TGS doesn't really like pantheons and here's his stance on it "ah hell nah I am not giving beem any siblings, I am not making a pantheon, those are stupid as hell and always follow the cycle of marriage issues, usurpers, war, incest, death, life, and the end and a new beginning every single time and I'm NOT letting that happen" I mean like uhhhhhh, oh yeah, he expands in power, size, complexity and metaphysicality and stuff uhhhh(I don't have alot going for this page so can someone expand it
