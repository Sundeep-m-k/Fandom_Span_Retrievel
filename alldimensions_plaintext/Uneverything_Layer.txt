Uneverything Layers are a measurement of size beyond the description of
Everything Layers
, and far beyond anything we can comprehend that we can't comprehend. For reference, an infinite amount of Everything Layers beyond countability or even the concept of numbers is what makes up the very first uneverything layer. With the exponential size gap between Everything Layers, it's hard to measure even the first Uneverything layer, let alone the second.

Seventh Anti-Uneverything Layer
[
]
The collection of all
Everything Layers
. The
Absolute Everything Layers
also agreed because it is extremely large, but not enough size for 6.5th Anti-Uneverything layer.
6.5th Anti-Uneverything Layer
[
]
That is very agreed to be
Pageverse
, that contains everything including
Absolute Everything Layers
, it can may contain itself because page "Pageverse" is a page (pageverse).
Sixth Anti-Uneverything Layer
[
]
It is agreed to be
Wikiverse
, since it contains everything on the wiki and is only bounded by
FANDOM
itself, and the point where verses start to become meta.  There is no known object in this wiki that can officially bypass the Wikiverse and ignore the contradiction that every page on the wiki is inside the Wikiverse to a point so humanly unimaginable and indescribable that even the Wikiverse cannot force the object into it and that it is truly beyond the Wikiverse. We can technically pass the Wikiverse by connecting a page to a document that is outside a wiki that is stored using a different service such as Google Docs, but however that would no longer be part of the wiki. Ruled by the owners of the
FANDOM
domain. The number changes as larger verses are created.
Fifth Anti-Uneverything Layer
[
]
These are the only very meta 'verses that can break the previously mentioned rule, starting with the
FANDOMverse
. Unknown, but extremely powerful beings control this entire layer.
Fourth Anti-Uneverything Layer
[
]
The Twenty Second Everything Layer is comprised of Browserverses such as the
Googleverse
.
Third Anti-Uneverything Layer
[
]
The Fourth Meta-Everything Layer is made up of Softwareverses such as the
Operationverses
and the
Virusverses
.
Second Anti-Uneverything Layer
[
]
The Fifth Meta-Everything Layer is the second to last Meta-Everything Layer before they loop. It is completely filled with
Computerverses
.
First Anti-Uneverything Layer
[
]
The Sixth Meta-Everything Layer is the final Meta-Everything Layer, this layer is made from
Networkverses
, which comprise the Internetverse. Beyond this, it loops back to the smallest Antieverything Layer
[
1
]
but on a much larger scale.
Nulth Uneverything Layer
[
]
The lowest of all Uneverything Layers, debatably even one. This is the totality of every single one of the standard loops.
First Uneverything Layer
[
]
Looptima-543
- The container of all loops. This is the first thing beyond all basic loops
Second  Uneverything Layer
[
]
Looptima-Infinity
- It contains all the loops. We have reached the king of loops. Next comes the Post-Loop stuff.
Third Uneverything Layer
[
]
The Nirvanian
- He is literally a god who contains Post-Loops verses and beyond them. He is everything and first thing with a beyond unit.
Fourth Uneverything Layer
[
]
The Meta-Box
- It literally contains all the concepts and everything. It is beyond everything and would be the biggest if it wasn't all just a simulation.
Fifth Uneverything Layer
[
]
The Ultimate Reality
- It contain all special Metaloops and first real Hyperverse. (not main Hyperverse, its like beyond of all concepts verse + if you want reach this you need beyond very big number of types loops like Ultraloops and Hyperloops at the very least, an example is the
0verse
)
Sixth Uneverything Layer
[
]
Finale of the Hyperverses
- The last Hyperverse. Everything beyond it is a Hyperverse relative to Hyperverses. (Alephiverses are like Hyperverses to basic Post-Loop verses)
Seventh Uneverything Layer
[
]
The Final êåø
x
iverse/êåø
êåø
iverse
- The second largest verse in the Hebrew Alphabet Verses chain, right after the
Taviverse
. Its uses êåø
êåø
ifinite Power when measuring it, and its size is around êåø
êåø
êåø
.
Eighth Uneverything Layer
[
]
Limit of Fiction
- A true unattainable and indescribable thing. It is literally the most indescribable and divine thing there is. It is not a concept and beyond everything. If it wasn't the biggest object in Metasm's imagination, then it would be more than a VAD box. By the way it contains all of the
Hypremums
.
Nineth Uneverything Layer
[
]
Metasm
- The final polyasm, Metasm is truly a force to be reckoned with. One of the most power phrenomancers
[
2
]
in all of existence, Metasm has won against beings equal in strength to multiple
TFOAVs
.
Tenth Uneverything Layer
[
]
The Terminality of all Verses
- The final and largest verse in all of existence, this very is incredibly dense. There are Œ©
◊ûax
TFIOAVs
in this verse. Any "verse" larger than it is a Metaverse, a verse way beyond verses.
Eleventh Uneverything Layer
[
]
True Omniverse
- The last known Pre-Cosmic Truth reality.
Twelvth  Uneverything Layer
[
]
The Cosmic Truth
- Despite the fact that this is a fact, this concept reflects the end of Hypercosmology because it says here that Hypercosmology has no end. However, it's in the way that the finite numbers of wiki pages have no end.  places meta cosmology as a new topic can be considered the only way to bypass hypercosmology without creating an infinite number of pages. But remember that hyper cosmology is not over and you will be able to continue to do the greatest among hypercosmology
Thirteenth   Uneverything Layer
[
]
Low Transumreality
-  Although it is a bridge between hyper cosmology and meta cosmology, but in fact, with respect to Hypercosmology, it is really the absolute and the most transcendent and unattainable that can and cannot be.
Fourteenth  Uneverything Layer
[
]
Beyond the Hypercosmos
- in fact, an ordinary universe in the form of a galaxy. Well, although because of superconceptuality, on the contrary, it is the most unusual and indescribably cool, but the bottom line is that this is the most fundamental thing in meta-cosmology and is outside hypercosmology
Fifteen  Uneverything Layer
[
]
The Impossible hierarchy
- its like
The Infinite Chain
but in Metacosmology. Infinity hierarchy of infinity meta realites.
Sixteen  Uneverything Layer
[
]
The True End
- this is the limit for Meta creatures that are also super conceptual and we will not be able to understand or realize them.
Seventeenth  Uneverything Layer
[
]
The Greatest End-All-Be-All
- the end of the usual meta things is coming and something interesting is coming.......
