Introduction
[
]
Terabithia
is a first world
country
part of the
LUA
. It also is currently the only country that has ascended above the
Multiverses
in our local
Box
. It has expanded so much, it has bases in 2 different
Omniverses
. This makes it a type X civilization on the
kardeshev scale
.
It's government is a democratic parliamentary republic. The government is so good and uncorrupted in fact, that it is ranked as the 2nd least corrupted country in our local
Cetaverse
. It is inhabited by
humans
and
other beings
that survived the
great genocide
.
The population of the nation is 1.274 quintillion. Some insane people in the nation think the population is infinite though. They got into the alliance in 1892
OYC
. Its government is well run and stable and its prime minister is a clone(not flash clone) of
Someone who owns a fish
. The Minister of Defense is a clone(not flash clone) of
Idontknow350
or "Battledude" as the clone prefers to be called, since he can't be there to govern the country and update his fandom feed at the same time. The President of Terabithia is flash clone of
Durvonisback
. The
metasaungs
are officials that help run the empire and serve as police, fire fighters, medical personnel, soldiers or government officials usually, although they can take any job they want.
This is Terabithia's emblem
The GDP is ♾️ basically (probably wrong). There is almost no poverty and it is pretty much a utopia. Although it has been at war with the
Aculonian empire
and the
Etrurians
, it is a relatively peaceful nation now. There is also the
Terabithian revolution
. This is the only country in the
LUA
that has an
Alternate
lab in it, because it is damn expensive to build one. This is all we can say about this topic though, as the rest of the information on the government has been classified.

National Anthem
[
]
The anthem has gone through 2 versions. The first version can be found by clicking
this link
, and the second version is written below:
Say I'm cold-hearted
But I'm just getting started
Got my eyes on the the target
Now, now
Oh, oh, oh
'Til the battle's won
'Til kingdom come
Oh, oh, oh
I'll never run
Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty
Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty
They'll be calling me royalty
They say I'm dangerous 'cause I
Broke all their cages
No, I, won't sit and take it
Now, now
They left me for dead, I guess they'll never learn
Every time I break there's just more pain to burn
They'll never, never, never learn
Oh, oh, oh
'Til the battle's won
'Til kingdom come
Oh, oh, oh
I'll never run
Best to give me your loyalty
'Cause I'm taking the world, you'll see
They'll be calling me, calling me
They'll be calling me royalty
Best to give me your loyalty

Exports
[
]
Terabithia used to be a major exporter of electronics, although it has recently turned into a raw materials exporter. Terabithia is a main exporter of
Toxicuandaic slurry
, as well as all minerals from the
TREEVERSE
such as
TREEKITE
and
Upyte
. Terabithia also exports
hyperatoms
as a source of energy.
Terabithia officially owns the
Teraverse
where
Glitchonicite
in its liquid state can be found.
Transinfinate
pipes made out of
omegite
are currently draining away this liquid for use. This element is used to make all of its exports, and is heavily guarded. Terabithia is a minor exporter of
Tetium
, with
Glico
dominating most of the market. These pipes also drain away Quektonite from the
Quexaverse
in order to duplicate minerals. Another mineral called Quektonicite is illegally exported from the country, although the police has recently been extremely successful in stopping this.
Treisite
,
Olusen
,
Adamantine
and
Swagggium
are also minerals that Terabithia exports.
Purialiconicite
,
Guaca Regia
and
Corruptite
are used for military purposes and cannot be sold commercially according to
Act 91
of the
LUA
laws (although
Guaca Regia
is also permitted to be used in biosafety level 4 labs and secure chem labs.) They are only sold to other nations for safety purposes. It also sells
sentient substances
commercially as pets for little children as they are easy to control, fun to play with and show their emotions.
Coomathol
and
Orasfluid
is also exported as an efficient fuel for vehicles. These are used to get everything else the country needs. Orasfluid can also be drunk since it tastes like chocolate and isn't toxic.
Chirium
is also used for an efficient energy source since it is radioactive and never decays.
Terabithian military

The Terabithian military is the
LUA
's 3rd best military with a force of 12.7 trillion men(unconfirmed and most of the army are robots ). The list below is the equipment of the Terabithian military:

Harlem Hellfighters
[

The Harlem Hellfighters Logo
The
Harlem Hellfighters
are an unofficial militia group that assists the Terabithian military. The militia formed by Jake Clark in 17457
OYC
and since then has been largely successful, reusing abandoned military bases and  actually managed to expand to other nations in the
LUA
and even in the
Danoy Universal Group
or DUG. They are actually a great help in a war because their tireless fierce fighting and courage and the fact that they are mainly comprised of civilians boosts overall moral. They currently number 62 billion. They aren't just comprised of humans(any species is accepted) but all members neeed to be good at fighting, which is the only requirement you need to go in. The Terabithian government currently pays for weapons and any training necessary.

Universe  W-9751
[
]
Universe W-9751 is a secret universe that the whole
LUA
uses to conduct secret experiments. It is very closely guarded and everything going on in there is classified and guarded very closely. Some deaf crew members of ships that look at the universe border from the outside say(through sign language of course) that they see burn marks on the surface of the universe and what seems like giant rocks turning green inside the blurry universe and exploding. There is also the sound of a giant drill that never stops. The noise is so deafening they say, that they went deaf even when they put on the highest grade earmuffs they could get. Another
Alternate
lab( the first one is on planet Jejaju) is rumored to be inside there, but it is unconfirmed and has been denied by the Terabithian government.
Incidents
[
]
The
CAURGE
tried to invade Universe WR-8139 causing panic and chaos. The government calmed the public down in 2 days as the
CAURGE
was defeated with the help of the
Yayversians
and the
LUA
(everyone else had no army to spare).
