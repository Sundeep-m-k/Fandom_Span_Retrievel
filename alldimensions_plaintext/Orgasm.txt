Orgasm is the ultimate polyasm... It is even more ultimate than
Metasm
! In fact it is so ultimate that it is not technically a polyasm, but rather a
Hyperpolyasm
. Inside Orgasm's mind there is the imagination of Metasm as well as a million bajillion+ other Metasms. He is so powerful that he created the
Wikiverse
, however he also uses such things to imagine other things.
Why is it so powerful?

The Orgasm is actually not so powerful in it's orginal world, but it had the ability to simulate cause and effect within its mind. The Orgasm wanted to create its own empire. Eventually, Orgasm decided to go into a "coma" where it actually just allocated all of its energy to its imagination. The Orgasm then used this to create millions of other smaller Orgasms (they are called polyasms now) to create a huge mass of verses which were entirely controlled by Orgasm.
