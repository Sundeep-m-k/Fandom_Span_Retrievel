and has pulled many space rocks to it. That is also the reason why it has over 1500 satellites. The Magnet is a rogue planet, and moves randomly throughout the
Cetaverse
in which it is in.
Somehow, The Magnet does not have a lot of gravity, even though it is quite dense and big. The Magnet has also been found to disobey many more basic laws of physics. That has led some creatures to believe that The Magnet originated in the
Second Realm
, although no one is sure.

Layers
[
]
The Magnet has 3 layers, each being different sizes, colors, and with different properties.
First Layer (Surface)
[
]
The first layer of The Magnet is made out of some metals such as iron, platinum, and even gold at times. This layer appears to be white/brown/gray/black, and is also the only layer of The Magnet to have any life.
The surface has many mountain ranges and a few active volcanoes that can sometimes erupt lava.
Second Layer (Mantle)
[
]
The second layer of The Magnet is the mantle. This layer is basically a hot soup of magnetic substances mixed together. This layer is too hot for any life to survive here, and temperatures usually average more than 2 billion Kelvin.
Third Layer (Core)
[
]
The third layer, the core, is the final layer of The Magnet. The core is also extremely dense and is quite small as well (compared to The Magnet's total diameter), only being about a few thousand miles across.
This layer is also what is responsible for the extremely strong magnetic pull of The Magnet, and also where the planet gets its name. The core, since it is so dense, has a small chance of collapsing on itself, thus completely destroying The Magnet and forming a black hole. However, this is very unlikely.
Life
[
]
The life on The Magnet has adapted to the strong magnetic pull from the core of The Magnet and also has to avoid using metal since the metal will immediately get pulled to the center of The Magnet, and with extreme speed and force, increasing the chance for the metal to crush the life.
This life resembles lizards of some sort, and can easily scale up the steep and tall mountain ranges on the surface of The Magnet. This life has somewhat colonized some satellites, although not to a large degree.
The life has built sizable superstructures with the sole purpose of harvesting minerals from the satellites.
Superstructures (all for mining)
[
]
The life has not built many superstructures as some other Post-Box civilizations, but they have built quite a few. Most are for mining purposes. Here are a few superstructures built by the life.
MinersHavenM43
[
]
Superstructure A-237, otherwise known as MinersHavenM43, was a huge superstructure designed to mine The Magnet for valuable minerals. MinersHavenM43 is fully automatic. This superstructure was the 6th superstructure to be built by the life on The Magnet, built all the way back in 14 OYC. MinersHavenM43 got destroyed in 56 OYC, after an error in the superstructure caused it to identify minerals wrong, identifying the life on The Magnet for minerals. In total, 45 creatures perished.
The superstructure got terminated afterwards.
Holoomanga
[
]
Superstructure I-782, otherwise known as Holoomanga, was one of the least efficient mining superstructures ever built by the life on The Magnet. Holoomanga was slow, faulty, and it also frequently broke. After countless
OYC
days spent fixing this superstructure, the superstructure was eventually scrapped and the spare materials were used to build the MinersHavenM43 superstructure.
Rwa45r
[
]
Superstructure P-839, otherwise known as Rwa45r, was the 3rd mining superstructure to be built by the life. It was originally very faulty and it broke often, just like the Holoomanga superstructure. However, further improvements to the mining mechanism improved Rwa45r's capabilities and efficiency. Today, Rwa45r is still in use, and is frequently used as a back-up mining superstructure in case any of the main mining superstructures break down or stop working.
Satellites
[
]
There are countless satellites that orbit The Magnet. Each one is different, and virtually all of them house either metal or valuable minerals such as
Nihonium
, quartz, ruby, diamonds, emeralds, and amethyst. Here are a few notable satellites.
Each of the numbers in the names of each satellite are there for easier identification of each satellite.
Satellite 56-B
[
]
Satellite 56-B is one of the biggest satellites ever discovered throughout the big mess of space rocks and debris surrounding The Magnet. 56-B is over 849 miles across, which is quite big for just a piece of space rock. 56-B has been repeatedly mined over the hundreds of
OYC
for its excess amounts of valuable minerals.
A big colony has also been established on 56-B by the life on The Magnet.
Satellite 90-A
[
]
Satellite 90-A is another notable satellite, also being quite big at approximately 673 miles across. This satellite is also well known because of its roughly spherical shape. 90-A has almost no metal in it, so it must have randomly floated into the mess of satellites somehow or got pulled by the gravity of The Magnet, which is quite weak.
Even though 90-A has absolutely no metal, it is rich in minerals, particularly amethyst. That is also why it is called 90-
A
(Amethyst? A?), and not 90-B or something else.
90-A also has a colony on it, although it isn't as big as the one on Satellite 56-B.
Satellite 12-N
[
]
Satellite 12-N is another satellite with no metal in it, just like Satellite 90-A. This satellite is not as big as the previous two, and is only 12 miles across at its longest point. 12-N mostly consists of Nihonium, hence the 'N' in the name. 12-N does not have a colony on it as of yet.
