History
[
]
Smeele was created when one of our
Box
's recursive layers collapsed before the massive explosion that caused it to become maximally chaotic. This occured with a phenomenon that was a lot smaller that the one that created the explosion that caused the creation of a catalyst or egg 1 lightyear wide that was made of transversal matter.
Then, when its Omniverses were created, the catalyst fell into the main Omniverse - our one - and chemically reacted with some of the
particles
in its void to create a small being. Smeele consumed
protoverses
, tiny
proto-universes
created mere
OYC
after this Omniverse and eventually because a cool guy god. With their power, they decided to look over their Omniverse and protect it.
