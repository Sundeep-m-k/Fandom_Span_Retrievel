Almost all known universal civilizations are part of the LUA, except for civilizations like:
The Oynikus (Originating from UNI-1049) - They are typically isolationist, except for their limited trade with the Yehme which are from the same galaxy as them.
The Misin (from UNI-91) - they are naturally very hostile towards any other life.
The Rivalin Empire (from UNI-123) - They declare war on any species that tries to interact with them.
The Lra (from UNI-382) - They were once part of the LUA, before attacking another civilization because they were refusing to join.
Humanity
was only allowed recently into the Alliance, because of the big distrust of the other members towards it. The
Tuhis
were very recently brought in, because of their war with
humanity
, and also they decided to join because their population was decreasing and needed help.

Creation
[
]
The LUA was created 362 million B.C. when a species, called the
Trenacs
were fighting a lot with the
Enuos
in UNI-328. They eventually almost died out(both) a million years later from war, so they made an alliance. They were both a type 2.3 and after the alliance quickly upgraded to a type 3. They formed a Galactic Alliance, before becoming a Universal Alliance 25 million years later. This is when a lot of species joined, about 473 more, and after 183 million years, they became the Local Universal Alliance and made peace with other civilizations in other universes. At that time, it had 2 million civilizations. Now, it has 9 million civilizations. In total, the population of the LUA is 834 quintillion.
Systems
[
]
(systems of time, length, etc. that the LUA uses)
Time
[
]
The time-system is based off the time of Kamala(see below)
Smallest unit: Oen- about 2.0923 seconds(smaller versions include millien, microen, nanoen,...yoctoen etc)
Kyhm- 10 Oens
Jesin- 100 Kyhm
Vrass- Day on Kamala, 100 Jesin
Uv- Year for Kamala, 147 Vrass
Year
[
]
Years are based off of how many Uv since the formation of the LUA, which it has been about 150.1 million Uv since. It is called AAF, or after alliance formation. People also use
OYC
as a "year".
Length
[
]
The length system is based off of Humanity's metric system.
Government
[
]
The government in the LUA is very important, as it helps decide on what events they should do and how they are going to be doing them. Their form of government is an
oligarchy
, where several people rule. The members of the oligarchy are the head members of all the civilizations. This allows for more differentiated ideas, which allows for a lot of good ones.
Branches
[
]
All branches are partly paid for by all nations except for the
Alternate
lab which is owned by Terabithia because they are the only nation rich enough to build one and they have the best security of all nations.
Research Branch (L.R.B.)
Focuses on doing research and advancing scientific knowledge.
Kamala, the L.R.B. Headquarters
The Research Branch is currently headquartered in Kamala, a rocky
planet
in
UNI-205
. They are currently focused on developing a machine to destroy
Sproyongs
because they are causing too many deaths in universes.
Diplomacy Branch (L.D.B.)
Resource Extraction Branch (L.R.E.B.)
Catastrophe Prevention Branch (L.C.P.B.)
