Micro-Axions
, despite of being almost
nothing
in size, they're known to construct basic concepts of axiologist theories, and are basic modules in any scale of Axions and properties. They are classified as Class 2 Axions, with basic abilities as restriction.
Micro-Axions only have 4 phases, extremely less than almost infinite phases of
Tiny Axions
. They are resembled like axioms in set theory and are basic building blocks. They are the modular scale in abstraction. However, due to scarce amount of phases, their purposes and patterns are just varieties of randomness.

5 Axioms

Axiom of Extensibility (ax-ext)
[
]
Axiom of Extensibility states anything can be extended by combining with greater axioms. It can be used to define less strictly mathematics, like climbing up through metamath.
Axiom of Choice (ax-ch)
[
]
Not to be confused with
the Axiom of Choice in ZFC
.
Axiom of Choice states anything are feel free to use one of any at least 2. Without this significant axiom, everything would be monotonic and patterned; and translating things would be impossible.
Axiom of Well-Ordering (ax-wo)
[
]
Axiom of Well-Ordering states one value should be greater than another value. Using it repeatedly leads to the creation of number-digital systems, and can be used to make up dimensions with ax-inf. It is a reason why "Numbers" are branched from zero; with the freedom of dimensionalities, signs, and digits; usually coming from any numeral system.
Axiom of Infinity (ax-inf)
[
]
Axiom of Infinity states there exists an
Infinity
above smallest well-ordered set of
"numbers,"
and "absolute infinity" that Axions can't reach. Hence it replicates basic mathematical kinds, it is used to create infinite ordinals in an abstract way.
Axiom of Nullity (ax-nul)
[
]
Axiom of Nullity state that there exists a nullity, which is definable by non-Nothing Axions; placing it below Nothing Axiom in the hierarchy of nullity. Mostly, every kind is settled in different abstraction dimensions. It also tells that there are varieties of nullities, regardless of readability and definability. ax-nul is used to define
null
as an example.
