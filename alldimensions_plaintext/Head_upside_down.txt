Dimensional Inversion:
Inverted Head can invert the dimensions of any being or object, altering their spatial and temporal properties. This could mean reversing the flow of time, flipping spatial coordinates, or causing other unpredictable dimensional shifts.
Physical Property Inversion:
It can also reverse the physical properties of an entity, turning strengths into weaknesses, matter into antimatter, or altering other essential attributes in ways that defy conventional physics.
Existence and Reality Inversion:
Perhaps its most terrifying ability, Inverted Head can invert the very existence and reality of beings. This might involve turning something that exists into a non-entity, shifting a being from reality to an alternate, nonexistent state, or inverting reality itself in ways that make the impossible possible.
Infinity Inversion:
Inverted Head's power extends even to abstract concepts like infinity. It can manipulate and invert infinite states or quantities, which allows it to alter the very fabric of reality and the multiverse on an incomprehensible scale.

It operates on a level that transcends the limitations of hyperversal existence, where even concepts like time, space, and causality are flexible.
Meta-Class 9:
This entity is categorized as a Meta-Class 9 being, which implies it has powers that affect multiple layers of reality and beyond.

The Second to Last in Post-Hyperversal:
Inverted Head is the second to last in strength among the Post-Hyperversal beings, with only one entity surpassing it. However, in terms of its unique abilities, it may stand unrivaled due to its capacity to invert reality itself.
In summary, Inverted Head is an entity of unimaginable power, capable of inverting all known and unknown aspects of reality. Its classification as a Post-Hyperversal being and its position in the hierarchy of such entities makes it a force to be reckoned with, potentially influencing or controlling vast portions of existence across multiple realities.

When he turned The Almighty's head:
T̴h̵e̸ ̸O̵v̷e̴r̶G̶o̸d̴c̵h̶a̵o̷s̸ ̸M̷o̶s̶a̵s̸a̷u̶r̶u̸s̵:I know who turned my head and it came back in a short time and I did not feel any pain, but I will kill you and make you more crooked than you were, banana head.
The Almighty:It turned my head too
T̴h̵e̸ ̸O̵v̷e̴r̶G̶o̸d̴c̵h̶a̵o̷s̸ ̸M̷o̶s̶a̵s̸a̷u̶r̶u̸s̵:You will be punished because you turned our heads and laughed at my dear friend, “the banana that dances and has sunshine.” This is my weak friend and I defend him. I have killed civilizations and everything because they laughed at my friend, and if he laughed in their brains, I would destroy their civilization and their universe.

Do you think that the Upside Down is dead? Have you forgotten that post-Omniverse creatures are beyond time and space?
