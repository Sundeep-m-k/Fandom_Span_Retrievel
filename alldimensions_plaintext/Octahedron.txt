An
Octahedron
is the three-dimensional cross polytope. It is the dual of a
cube
in other words, it is a
cube
where all
vertices
have been replaced with
faces
and all
faces
have been replaced with
vertices
.
It is also the
triangular
antiprism
, a fact that can clearly be seen from its graph. In addition it is a square bipyramid, meaning it is composed of two square pyramids stuck together at their bases. The dihedral angle of an octahedron is the arcos(-13). The octahedron has four triangle meeting at a vertex.

Jonathan Bowers
calls the octahedron an
Oct
, a shortened form of its name. The Higher Dimensions wiki sometimes calls this shape an
Aerohedron
, from aero- referring to a cross polytope and -hedron referring to three dimensions.
It can also be called a rectified
tetrahedron
or tetratetrahedron, as it can be made by truncating a
tetrahedron
to the midpoints of the edges. In this form it can be represented as
r
{
3
,

{\displaystyle r\{3,3\}}
.
Structure
[
]
The octahedron is composed of 8 triangles, with four of them meeting at each vertex. It is formed of two suare pyramids joined together. It is also a triangular antiprism, composed of two triangles, in dual orientations, joined by a band of 6 triangles.
