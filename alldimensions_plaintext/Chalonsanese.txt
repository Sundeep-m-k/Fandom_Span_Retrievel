Overview
[
]
The Chalonsanese are a species of sentient creatures inhabiting the universe of Chalonsan (designated U-@5$^^, located in M-()0*@.) They are intelligent entities and live in diverse civilization built upon various planets in Chalonsan, across a volume of space equivalent to that of a galaxy.
Appearance
[
]
The Chalonsanese are indeed curious creatures. The resemble a deformed human, but their skin colour is black and orange and they possess several unique external organs. These include:
Four spheroid rear legs for propelling themselves through interdimensional space
Four hands on each arm, with two fingers each. These hands are utilized mainly for multitasking and physical work as their skin surface is rough and increases friction for said purposes.
A thick shell of unidentified material, used for protection against threats.
A round capsule of energy on the top of their heads for spatial transportation.
In addition, the Chalonsanese are cold-blooded; they can survive harsh conditions, some of which include harsh planetary weather, deity attacks, dimensional attacks, and can withstand temperatures up to 520 degrees Celsius. They do not grow hair on their bodies or any outer covering apart from their thick skin.
However, there is still diversity in how they appear. Some Chalonsanese have lighter hues of skin, while others may have different colours (although this is a rarity).
Communication and behaviour
[
]
Communication
[
]
The Chalonsanese are entities that have learnt to speak the common tongue. They are mostly fluent in speaking and have intelligence no less than a common dimensional god. Sometimes when they are communicating with others of the same species across a long distance, they will emit a loud, high-pitched wail from the inside of their body, despite having no speaking organs located there. They acknowledge this unusual way of speaking as 'chalonspeak'. Sometimes, experienced chalonspeakers can communicate even from dimensions away.
Chalonsanese that are older in age also may use words that older generations have created especially for their use. This remains a cultural practice of the Chalonsanese.
Behaviour
[
]
The Chalonsanese are similar to mortal humans in many aspects. For instance, they go about their daily lives which are almost identical to that of a human, except the fact that they do not wear clothes. They are generally friendly and are not hostile unless agitated or attacked, like humans.
Civilization
[
]
The cities built upon the earth of many planets grow over the years in number. As of recent record (-1 OYC from current point of time), there exists 14,091 colonies of Chalonsanese. Every few OYC, the entities will explore new hitherto not encountered parts of the universe they live in and establish colonies (eventually progressing to cities) on those planets. Overall, their Kardashev scale ranks 2.74. The table below shows some distinct characteristics of Chalonsanese civilization.

conclusion
Qwerty-41
The civilization established on Qwerty-41 is entirely built underground, with a long hallway made of standard building material leading to a 1.4km

space of underground living. The city has multiple levels, too; the houses built there are insulated and protected.
The said city is entirely subterranean. Other cities may have underground features, but not to such an extent.
The Chalonsanese have innovated and progressed to the point of secluded, underground living.
GyromeX 65
The city built upon the ground of GyromeX 65 has a protective force-field sphere of radius 10km surrounding it. Experiments have shown that the buildings within are invulnerable to any form of external harm, meaning that such a civilization is highly protected against physical and possibly super-physical threats.
Other cities are known not to specialize in protective technology.
Some Chalonsanese have developed their technology to an advanced level.
Kyzre-4Wk
The original 'small colony' on Kyzre-4Wk has developed immensely; the entire civilization is now on space, supported by space elevators that reach down to the surface of the planet some 100,000 kilometres below. The city's buildings are connected via transparent hallways composed of a tough material and the buildings and structure is sturdy but simple to produce. As resources are harvested from the planet's surface, the Kyzre-4Wk super colony utilizes artificial light from other dimensions to power the planet's functions. They have also been known to be the first civilization to be able to teleport from one verse to the other quickly and swiftly.
So far, the Chalonsanese living there are not at all affected by the risky conditions of living in space.
Other civilizations simply do not have access to such technology. Perhaps this colony had planned travelling to this planet beforehand.
Besides accelerating greatly in terms of technological advancement, Kyzre-4Wk citizens have adapted well to the environment and the conditions.
HY-##
Despite the hardship, HY-## citizens have transplanted their own very conscience and soul into the metaverse. They were formerly a physical establishment, but evolved to become thinkers beyond mortal comprehension. They reduced in physical form and slowly siphoned their very existence into the realm of virtual reality, powered by supercomputers gifted by advanced colonies.
Without the needs of orthodox life bothering them, they have become no less than minor gods.
Explicitly shown, the other civilizations have not devoted their lives to thinking and more of working.
The species has ascended in terms of immortality and this proves that even normal beings can become higher ones too.
Culture
[
]
The Chalonsanese are diverse beings with a fascinating background and culture that reaches down to the core of their morals, thus displaying the key essence of a Chalonsanese.
Tradition
[
]
Chalonsanese tend to eat meals every 6 hours, regardless of time of day.
Chalonsanese avoid using their transportational abilities more than once per day as they believe this will bring them bad luck.
Chalonsanese do not trust gods, unless they are the ones that created them. Till the current point of time, Chalonsanese still remember their creator.
Chalonsanese will do anything to achieve perfect roundness in architecture.
Chalonsanese have special tools for mining that have been adapted and vary, but remain the same overall - A steel pole with an extendable flap at the end. This tool has proven both efficient and easy to use.
Chalonsanese's traditional weapons:
Haksonan
, a long metal stick built of their unique material with a long, thin blade appended to the side.
Arno
, a curved stick with a blade that is shaped like a triangle. Comparable to a dagger.
Derq
, a stick of any material with an orb of dimensional energy compressed at one end. This weapon's functioning involves strong dimensional deity magic and is very difficult to master.
Saque
, a seemingly 2-dimensional line that can do as its owner commands. E.g. strangle an enemy. The natives know it as a sacred object.
Disrespectful gestures

Teleporting/Phaseshifting/Warping through dimensions in public
Not wearing a hat (if you are of another species)
interfering with dimensional affairs (Chalonsanese only)
Disrupting someone when they are travelling
Saying the words '
tidak awak
'
This actually means No u in Malay
Being cringy in public. This is generally punishable by law in all Chalonsanese settlements.
Consuming non-natural liquid in public. The Chalonsanese do not approve of this behaviour and believe that all consumed liquid should be natural. Milk does not count as unnatural.
Having a physical form that glows. Deities need to be careful when travelling to Chalonsanese cities.
Saying something twice when it is unnecessary.
History

The Chalonsanese's history have a deep influence on their practices and knowledge. Till today, their ever-expanding history remains one of the most valued cultural and historical knowledge to be witnessed.
The Genesis (1340 OYC - 1470 OYC)
[

Notable Historical Events
1340 OYC
From the ashes of Challnon, their primordial god-creator, the Chalonsanese rise as a new species of mortal. They populate their home planet, Kunson (ZA-*&5) and begin as a new civilization. At first, they were shunned by the gods and other species as Challnon was their enemy. But as the Chalonsanese grew more advanced, this disrespect slowly faded.
1344 OYC
The Chalonsanese split into different tribes, each having their own unique purpose. There, at this point of time, exists only 4 tribes.
1361 OYC
The Chalonsanese discover the art of magic and use it to their advantage - for weapons, everyday routines and doing physical work.
1372 OYC
An artifact was discovered by the Chalonsanese as they stumbled upon a mysterious black rock while hunting for entities to consume. They immediately were gifted the knowledge that the rock was part of the body of Challnon, their ancestor deity. They decide to utilize the rock for construction purposes and that was how their building material was invented.
1400 OYC
Their technology advances rapidly - they have discovered how to make metal and craft from iron. They expand over large territories, splitting into over 50 tribes and nations. However, disagreements start brewing between them - they start advancing more to compete with one another.
Era 2: Age of advancement (1405 OYC)

Year
Notable Historical Events
1405 OYC
The Chalonsanese discover new ways to produce fine objects - using a traditional technique known as Yuwel. The Chalonsanese duplicate their desired items again and again, supplying their people in drastically reduced time. However, this method exhausts their magical energy quickly and they decide to use this minimally.
1407 OYC
Battles between tribes erupt. At this moment, there exists more than 10,000 Chalonsanese, and the limited resources around them are beginning to diminish. More than 1,000 of them were killed in battles. As tribes overcame each other, there was no way to have peace other than to separate them all.
1410 OYC
After a unanimous decision, the original tribe stayed put. The other tribes moved at least 12 km away from each other, reducing their interaction and disagreement. However, they still spread innovations and knowledge around during inter-tribe meetings, a great form of communication.
1415 OYC
The nations start to develop their unique words for communication within the tribe. This has been attributed to the special words they use today.
1423 OYC
All of a sudden, a meteor sent by the gods hit Kunson, wiping out 1/2 of the population. As such, the nations start to discuss how to avoid these attacks. Word has spread that there exists more worlds in their universe, but since there was no evidence, the idea was immediately dismissed.
