Hair droyer
[
]
This verse has a lot of hair droyers. Hair droyers are a lot like hair dryers, but they are better. Drying your hair is just removing the water from your hair, but droying it is removing everything from your hair. They are very useful if you wash your hair (preferably with the
Dish wipesvers
because their cleaning service is much better and the
Shamp woovers
service sucks, don't listen to them) and you need to droy it because droying your hair is usually really hard.
The hair droyers work because instead of blowing air, they suck things in. Since your hair is attached to your head, it won't suck in the hair, but it will suck in the water and everything else. The stuff it sucks in are then shrunk by the mechanism built into one of the hair droyers because we need to save space. Then, there is a teleporter at the bottom of the hair droyer that teleports anything that goes into it into the costco. The costco is huge, so the hair droyers are very effective and they are also only here, so it is a good idea to go to this verse if you need to droy your hair.
Mommy tommy
[

The hair droyers were all created by someone called Mommy Tommy. Mommy Tommy just made a factory that created all of the hair droyers in this verse, and nobody knows how the factory works, so Mommy Tommy is very intelligent, obviously.
However, other than the hair droyers, that's about it. Mommy Tommy didn't really do anything else, and hasn't been seen since she made all of the hair droyers. The Hair droyervers is also shaped like Mommy Tommy, but no one knows where Mommy Tommy actually is. Maybe she's making hand sanitozer.
You go to the costco
[
]
After the hair droyers are used, the stuff that they suck up is brought to a teleporter which teleports them to the costco. The costco is a very nice and big place, it has a storage room which has a lot of the stuff from people's hair, such as water and oil. Yeah, I don't know why people have oil in their hair.
The storage room is accessible, and you can go inside, but it is pretty gross, it's good that they are kept in there so they don't go to the other part of the costco. Inside, it is just boring grey, but that's because no sensible person will live in there.
The costco, along with that, is also just a normal costco. You can buy everything in there, it is an infinite store and it sells everything so you can buy whatever you want, except shamp woo, that's banned. Use the
Dish wipesvers
, it's way better.
Woooooooooooooooo hghghghghghghgghghhhhghgggghghhghghhghghghg bi,
[

The Hair droyervers was made by the same person who made
Dish wipesvers
,
Shamp woovers
and
Toiloot watervers
. Therefore, he also left a description on this verse when he created it. The description was "Mommy tommy you go to the costco woooooooooooooooo hghghghghghghgghghhhhghgggghghhghghhghghghg bi,". The "mommy tommy" describes, well, Mommy Tommy, the creator of the hair droyers. The "you go to the costco" is talking about the costco in the verse, and the "woooooooooooooooo hghghghghghghgghghhhhghgggghghhghghhghghghg bi," is likely just a humourous statement to contrast the other descriptions, which are all gibberish and end with "bye", "hi" or "buy". Also, there is a comma at the end, which is just a weird side effect.
