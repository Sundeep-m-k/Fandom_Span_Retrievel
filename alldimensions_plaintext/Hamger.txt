Hamger is a humanoid-porcine cosmic entity who wishes nothing but food upon itself and others. While naturally self-preserving, it isnt necessarily greedy and will share food with those around it. It will also not eat or distribute food-based verses with sapient residents, such as the
Foodverse
, some
Cheeseverses
, and
Cranberryverses
. It will grow food on every uninhabited planet it can possibly find which can sustain food, and will grow it with as much as the planet's spaces allow. It uses cells from many animal and plant species across the
Multiverses
to clone and harvest in Meat materializers and extremely efficient plantations of fruits, vegetables, and their personal favorite, tubers. Hamger is often hired by very agricultural nations to show them how to farm properly. In return, Hamger demands a bit of their output for some years to any who request teachings on agriculture.
Gerhams
[
]
Gerhams are followers of Hamger who have similar goals of ending hunger, many are in it for themselves but a large portion worship Hamger or simply wish to help those within reality suffering. Hamger often demands his Gerhams to build farms out of blueprints or to find planets suitable for construction. Some
extremely
devout Gerhams have modified their genetics to be a figure similar to Hamger. When asked, Hamger was very indifferent to the situation.
