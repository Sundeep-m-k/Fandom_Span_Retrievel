explanation by example

imagine that you have a zero size.  You see an object 10 times bigger than you. But for ordinary people, it's the same size zero.
what if a zero-size civilization comes up with its own numerology regarding their size? it will turn out Null numerology.
The size of a 0 sized person is 2 Null meters
the size of  0 sized  universe is 600 billion Null light years
the size of the 0 sized  omniverse is ω Null light years.
numerology is done relative to the size of civilization. And although for them there is as big a difference between objects as between our objects in hierarchies, for us it will be 0
negative null meters, centimeters, light years we will have negative zero
-0=0 in our numerology but REALLY its cap
what about 0 null meters.........
imagine that you have a zero size......
what? double null numerology? Yes
its power of zero. Never ending null numerologys. triple null numerology....
these are levels of null
0 level- our numerology
1 level null numerology
2 level double null numerology  etc
how to represent numbers of different levels of null
1 level null (meters, ly etc)
2 level null  [2] null meters
3  level [3] null meters
∞ level [∞] null meters
Ω level [Ω] null meters
