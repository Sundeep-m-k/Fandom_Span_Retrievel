The
Cloudverse
is a large verse in which rests the
Cloud God
in the center.
The verse rests inside a thin, warpable, liquid material, which causes the lights of the verses to
reflect and warp also, like in a glass ball
. This layer is 20 million light-years big, which might not seem as small, but when compared to the overall size of the
Cloudverse
,
it is very small
.
Every 1
OYC
or so, the Cloud God starts to
pulsate, with seemingly random pulses of light and shakes
. The interval between each pulse is random, lasting anywhere from 5 hours to 12 weeks.
When this happens,
a strong wave of light and vibrations echoes throughout the
Cloudverse
until it terminates at the edge
, upon which the
Cloudverse
will be flung across space in a random direction. Since the
Cloudverse
is so large and stable, this effect can't be felt by anything inside of the
Cloudverse
.
Inside of the
Cloudverse
rest triangles
(known as Cloudshards)
, normal verses and Cloud-class stars, as well as
many more objects, all formed naturally
.
