Basic Fusions
[
]
Δ+Δ:
Primordium Delta
,   a multicoloured liquid which is
the most powerful substance
in all existence, is shown to have a form of intelligence.
Δ+Α (α): Angel Matter, an odd light yellow solid-ish material which angelic beings are usually made of.
Δ+Ω (δ): Demon Matter, a solid-ish dark blue material, which demonic beings are usually made of.
Δ+Σ (Ι): Ischyros Matter, a dark-silver chrome coloured hard material which is near impossible to destroy.
Α+Α:
Primordium Alpha:
a pure white glowing liquid, which gives off energy constantly, it is the opposite to
Primordium Omega
.
Α+Σ (γ): Light Matter, a simple fusion of an Α particle and a Σ particle would merely result in a photon, which would escape, but forcing this matter to conjugate together results in 'Light matter' an odd untouchable gas-like substance.
Α+Ω (Χ): This matter is physically impossible, forcing them to fuse would cause a huge explosion relative to the quantities of both the Α particles and Ω particles, where E = Α
Ω
Σ+Σ:
Primordium Sigma
, a white-green liquid with the ability to revert any damage done to it to the attacker, (while still taking the hit).
Σ+Ω (H): Hell matter, a TREMENDOUSLY unstable red-black liquid substance, within every square centimeter of this matter there are explosions the strength of more than 1000 atomic bombs, every single second.
Ω+Ω:
Primordium Omega
, a deep absolute black liquid which will consume any matter or energy that comes into contact with
Primordium Omega
.
H+H: (X) If this were made, it would just cause a huge explosion.
Non canon particles:
[
]
Φ+Φ:
Primordium Phi
, a changing colored fractal that constantly changes, any contact with any matter will glitch it out and it will turn into
Primordium Phi
.
Ω+Φ (ג): Black Hole Matter, a matter created when a black hole is formed that gets spewed out, or dies. Normally, this matter doesn't exist, but if you control a black hole, you can
IN FACT,
get the matter.
θ+θ (θ):
Primordium Theta
, a weird substance that changes everything except its pitch white color between containers. Possibility of Primordium Theta B., the same thing but different rules per container then regular Primordium Theta.
Δ+θ (?): Mimic Matter, a form of subatomic particle that can act as all particles in a verse it is in. Many beings are made of Mimic Particles without even knowing. It cannot mimic overly destructive or small particles, like Blueprint Particles or types of Death Matter. If they cannot find anything to mimic, it will act as a useless blue-grey particle.
θ+Α (?): Megaphoton. An extremely bright version of a photon that has a glow visible from meters away per particle. Large gatherings of these are blinding to everything that has eyes (except for high-level gods, of course). The speed of a Megaphoton is googologically larger then a regular one, causing high instability.
θ+Σ (X): Nothing happens. Squishing them together will only result in them being squished.
θ+Ω (?): Wacky Matter. Same rules as Primordium Theta, but what it affects changes every Plank Time. Rather stable itself, considering all the instability it causes elsewhere.
θ+Φ (X): Primordium Theta ignores the properties of Primordium Phi, but doesn't fuse with it.
Σ+Φ (Π): Draztiko Matter, very reactive, only doesn't react to Ischyros matter, otherwise it will be obliterated.
ε+A (ט): Xariatic Matter, a particle that ONLY fuses with Ischyros Matter, and with any other matter. It, well it explodes.
β+β (β): Primordium Beta, a particle that can split a particle into multiple states, causing strange situations.
β+Δ (?): Pop Matter, a particle that can split other particles into
Preprimordium Particles
.
β+Α (?): Antielectric Matter, a particle that behaves like electrons, but gives immense amounts of positive energy instead of negative energy.
β+Σ or β+Ω (?): Bacteria Matter, a particle that is like Primordium Sigma, except for the fact that every single time it is triggered, it gets "confused" and gets stuck in a loop of self-destruction, causing an
Omniverse
to become an infectious Undefined which can spread if
The Outside
of the infected Omniverse is destroyed.
β+Φ (?) Fungus Matter, a substance that can decompose Primordial particles in order to form special particles.
β+θ (?): ???, a particle so random that nobody knows what it even is.
β+ζ (?): Neutral Matter, a substance that can weaken the effects of any matter it combines with.
ζ+ζ (ζ): Primordium Zeta, a particle that can merge states of a particle into one unified state.
ζ+Δ (?): Passive Matter, a particle that can merge the power of two particles, causing them to not interact with each other.
ζ+Α (?): Collapse Matter, a particle that can make particles within π Primordial Particles choose a random particle to not interact with, leading to structures getting distorted and sometimes falling apart due to disorder.
ζ+Σ (?): Exposigma Matter, a particle like Primordium Sigma but way more dangerous to mess with.
ζ+Φ (?): Null Matter, a particle that literally does absolutely nothing other than be there under most settings. However, certain particles can force this particle to interact, opening up portals to
The Undefined
.
ε+Σ (E): Etratyruatic Particle, the only particle that CANNOT FUSE or you get a bomb that destroys
Omniverse
s.
ε+Ω (X): Void and Existence dont mix. Because
Primordium Omega
and
Primordium Epsilon
are different, destruction and existence, it doesnt exist and turns the area in 10
Universe
s wide into a black hole. The equation for the power amount is: P = P of Ω squared x P of ε squared | P = Power
ε+Φ (?): Infinite Particle, a particle that is when glitched by
Primordium Phi
it starts destroying it and splitting it making a shockwave.
ε+θ (?): Expoepsilon Matter, which is
Primordium Epsilon
but way more reactive and changing
Δ+ε (?): Life Matter, the matter that makes up ALL living beings (exept for gods)
β+ε (?): Fusion Matter, a matter that if 2 particles are close, it forces them to fuse
θ+β (?): Expobeta Matter, pretty much Primordium Beta, but WAAAAAY more dangerous. (CANON is ExbM)

Complex Fusions (Including non canon ones)
[
]
α+δ (ω): Primordial Insanity, a colossally unstable substance that generates extreme energy created by the Yin of angels and Yang of demons clashing. Great for strong bombs and can only be stabilized by at least the primordial gods.
α+Δ+H (ρ): Primordial Chaos, the most chaotic substance in all of the AD cosmology. One gram of Primordium Chaos is strong enough to kill even
Bongus
.
2α+Ω+Φ (ξ) Primordial ERROR, the most glitchy substance in all of the AD cosmology. Just a
Xoꓭ ǝʜT
sized cube in
Never
can glitch you to
Always
.
Δ+H (Γ): Glitch matter, a black and green chaotic substance found within the
Glitchyverse
, and can control the way matter behaves, almost as chaotic as Primordial Chaos.
Δ+Ι (Ζ): Zul'em matter, a dark purple solid metal-like substance, it is the most hard and stable material in existence, however only reacts to Glitch matter... Oddly.
Ω+γ (Ο): Dark matter, yes this is ''THE'' dark matter, the one which is invisible and which makes up approximately 27% of all matter in our universe.
Α+Δ+Ω (ς): Soul Matter, makes up the concept of consciousness itself, is usually found in an interconnected web pattern. The Primordium Delta part is the part which causes the consciousness.
δ+Δ+2Φ+Ω (ה): Primordial Deletion, It is the most destructive combo in all of AD. There are only 4 particles and they all are in
Existence
. They don't do bad stuff, they just clean the bad entities. If it is angry or mistaken a good creature as a bad creature they will destroy the wrong stuff, and when getting the wrong stuff they get mad so it get even more destructive. A single particle can kill pretty much any entity, but they are mainly friendly.
Δ+α: (Λ): Fabric matter, is used to make up the fabric of all space time.
2Α+Σ+2Ω (τ): String, its different vibrations cause all different types of particles.
ε+2Σ+Ζ (Ρ): Thread Particles, a particle that creates all
Threads
.
Α+H (η): Heaven Matter, a matter that gravitates all destructive energy from Hell Matter to it and is unaffected by it.
γ+Ο (ℵ): Photonic Superposition Matter, darkens very bright places and lights up dark places.
3Δ+55Ω+20ℵ+5β (ש): Photonic Antisuperposition Antiquarkatic Matter, is a matter that if touches a quark or a ℵ particle, it gets separated into its parts but the quark gets, yes unbonded. This matter can be VERY dangerous, at least handling a β particle is EXTREMLY hard so, its practically impossible to create it. Also if you're in a dark room it makes it lighter and darker at the same time, same with the light room.
ג+γ (צ): White Hole Matter, propels anything away from it and is the polar opposite to Black hole matter.
ω+ρ+β (∅): Death Matter, a substance so destructive and glitchy that it can obliterate an entire Realm with a single
Xoꓭ ǝʜT
sized cube. This substance has only been seen once.
10θ+4Δ+5Ω (no symbol):  Bouncy matter is a substance that can slingshot off of any sort of other thing at least half its size (in total mass) and rocket off of it at speed greater or slower than Megaphotons.
α+η (ϰ) Good Matter, a fusion that can destroy all bad fusions of Primordial Particles, such as Demon Matter, Hell Matter, etc. It is the matter that makes up God himself as well.
2(β+ζ)+Ζ (π) Template Matter, a fusion that is the combination of Neutral Matter and Zul'em Matter. It can be put into the Matter Transformer from
The Supply Store
to be changed into other types of matter.\
3(ℵ+Λ)+ξ+צ (?): Virus Matter, like Bacteria matter, but the "confusion" is it splitting it and forming it back, causing explosions to happen, but it also turns other particles into it, causing pretty much everything in it's reach to turn into it.
2(life matter)+3(Α+Λ)+π  (?) Unknown Matter, there is no info on it because it is too unknown.
3α+2β+7ω: (ae) AE Matter, this will disappear on contact with anything that isn't AE matter so it is unknown what it really is.
2Λ+7ω+2β+1α: (oe) OE Matter, this will freeze nearby primordium particles in time (including AE matter) but not itself, so if it moves away then the primordium particles it froze will become unfrozen. OE matter is extremely stable, however it explodes if it touches frozen AE matter that is touching more than 3 primordium particles which are also frozen.
11Λ+9θ+4ω+1α+4ζ: (☼) Burning Matter, this will gradually rise in temperature unless AE matter is thrown into it, in which it is destroyed instantly.
ζ+2Λ+19β+3π: (cV) Fusing Matter, it will fuse with nearby particles
3ζ+4K+2Λ+π: (cX) Hype Matter, it will fly into nearby particles, destroying them.
7ζ+3K+2Λ+3π+2α: (cB) Disassembler Matter, it decomposes nearby primordium particle fusions; tearing them into pieces.
11ζ+8K+13α+7π+17β+21ω+6צ: (cN) Living Matter, it is alive and has basic functions. It can also do basic math such as 3+5 (8)
14ζ+2Λ+π+4α+2צ: (cM) Liquid Matter, it behaves like a liquid.
(every bad primordium particle fusion)+53(deletion matter)+4ω+9ζ+3α+34β+19σ+20θ+13γ: (no symbol) Absolute Deletion Matter, it will delete everything it touches. No exceptions.
2(glitch matter)+34ω+12α+4(Λ+π+צ): (eM) Ender matter, it teleports anything it touches to a random location.
2ζ+9α+3Λ+17π+22ω+35צ: (☺) Funy Matter, this matter is funi HAHAHA! This is what
Funy Entities
are made of.
41α+2☼+7ω+9Λ+32π: (☻) Zerpy Matter, a completely random and pointless matter that is pretty much used for building strong things and nothing much else. Although, Zerpy Matter has to have VERY special conditions, or else it will start heating up twice as fast as Burning matter!
3ζ+2π+7Λ+4α+Σ: (cT) Glue Matter, it glues nearby primordium particles together at random.
ה+ה: (tה) Suicide Matter, it destroys itself instantly.
3β+2ζ+π+9α+6צ+cM+2θ: (vθ) Randomizer Particle, it turns nearby particles into random particles and nearby fusions into random fusions.
3β+5α+7Λ+14θ+9ζ+(π+ω)+4Δ: (ΐ) Ghast Matter, if it touches Good Matter, it will explode and catch fire about the same amount of power as 10 atomic bombs. This is what
Ghasts
are made of.
β+6262Λ+91θ+16ζ+(π+Δ)+19ω+8α+(Σ+צ)+☺+☻: (Ü) Programmable Matter, you can give it certain particle fusions to make it do tasks.
7Λ+2β+14ζ+(π+α)+4Σ: (vA) Stationary Matter, it cannot move after being formed.
3Λ+7cV+Ω: (vT) Weird Matter, basically it just sits but if it touches any plain particle things it transforms them into more weird matter
vT+vA+(cT+☺+☻) (vX) Crust Matter, it heats itself up until it is exactly 165 degrees fahrenheit, then it cools down and when it reaches absolute zero it bursts and converts all basic primordium particles that are by themselves and not in a group of primordium into crust matter
vX+2
β
{\displaystyle \beta}
(vY) Mysterium Primordium, its properties change every time it is created.
צ+vA (Gray Hole Matter) (vN), it cycles between propelling matter towards and away from it rapidly, causing an infinite loop. this matter cannot be moved, or it will turn into a bunch of dangerous primordium fusions and kill everyone

(Gyro matter) (GyMa) If touches any primordium particles it starts spinning at 99% speed of light, theoretically possible due to none existing because there needs to be alot of vX  matter. If mixed Ü it randomly combusts and all of it is converted to ש with some vN. It is unknown how this reaction occurs but it might be due to the vT, vX and the Λ
11Δ+3Ω+7Σ+9318597cV (Infinite matter) (InfMa) Has the same properties as Bacteria Matter and Gyro Matter but it doesnt explode or corrupt anything. Fusing Primordium Alpha and Primordium Omega makes a different matter.
δ

α
{\displaystyle \delta  \times \alpha}
(Transitional Matter) (txe) Transitions between different multiplications of delta, alpha, and omega primordium fusions. Some of such fusions are named, but most are not. It is extremely dangerous as you cannot know what it will transition into next, and during transitions it is incredibly dangerous and will likely destroy whatever verse it is in if it comes in contact with any particle.

θ
{\displaystyle H+\Omega \times \theta}
(kLM) Completely destroys spacetime. Might suddenly change dimensionality of the verse it is in. Might suddenly completely destroy time and make it function very very weirdly. (in its verse that is) Or it will just expand and burst, creating a massive explosion of other complex fusions.
-any (Ng) (Negated Matter) Forms from negating primordium particles or fusions and fusing them. Will often have opposite effect. May also be chaotic.

(PP) (Eraser) Erases itself and converts nearby particles into itself at the same time, destroying everything by erasing it from existence.j
α + δ x Λ + -vN (C) (Corrupted Matter) A black looking liquid that when touching anything will turn it into more corrupted matter, except for things that destroy matter, or things that transform matter.
GyMa + txe (sT) (Strange Matter) Similar to the dark matter one, yes this IS the strange matter that is made from strange quarks.
sT + -ω (eM) (Eternal Matter) Even more stable than Strange Matter, this can last forever and never get destroyed.\

(Am) (Antimatter) Yes, this is the antimatter that is the opposite of normal matter, however it is NOT negated matter.
(Everything Primordium-Particle Related Together, Possible, impossible, and Theoretical) (E) (Everything Matter) The Most Powerful Primordial Particle in existence, it is so powerful, that it can destroy things up to The End of Class-Based Hierarchies.
E+ -E (tbM) (The Box Matter) This type of matter makes the box, being everything that exists and everything that doesnt.
θ+β + (β+Δ + Α+Ω) + H+H (nPg) (Currently Unnamed): within the instant of its formation it would turn all surrounding particles into their most basic subidivisions. difficult to produce due to being so unstable it's hard to use anywhere, but it can be used to make "bombs".
(E+E) (Everything Symbol in Existence)-Primordium. In it's Entirety. It created ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING that can be made with Primordium Particles. It's so powerful that it makes even Everything Matter and Absolute Deletion Matter look like nothing in comparision. As It is so powerful, that if it died,
EVERYTHING
and I mean everything that is made with Primordial Particles or has any Primordial-Particle Related things in it will die as well. As The State of Primordial Particles depends on the State of Primordium Itself. So if Primordium Disspeared, Basically and Literally EVERYTHING Dissapears. Earth, Gone. The Universe, Gone, The Omniverse, Gone, Time and Reality, Gone, Alphasm, Gone, Everything Layers, Gone. EVERYTHING, even Chirae, gone.
EVERYTHING!!!
(Sorry.)
[removed] + Σ (Vb) (Virus Matter Type B): converts surrounding primordium particles into itself while producing more and more type b virus matter. endlessly. the only ways to contain it are neutralizing it (sterilizing), and actual containment from putting particles around it which are even more elementary than primordium, causing it to completely fill its confines and rest until it is neutralized or until the barrier is destroyed in some way.
theres also freezing matter but im too lazy 2 make it
But it still can't effect Looped Verses because Primordial Particles do not exist there.
