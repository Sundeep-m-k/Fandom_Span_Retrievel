The Cyclosphere is composed of many 'spheres' that are shaped in the form of a circle in the next 2 dimensions (hence the cyclo- prefix). Multiple spherisquares compounded together and they slowly rotate around each other in 'shells', so the spheres are actually layers of spheres inside of each other, each being very slightly smaller.
