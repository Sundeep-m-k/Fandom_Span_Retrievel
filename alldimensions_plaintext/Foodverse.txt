The
Foodverse
is a large verse stationed in an
Omniverse
which contains entirely food-based structures. Planets, stars, you name it. The diversity has died down a large amount, though, due to the terraforming performed by the nation of
Candyland
. Before that happened, though, the Foodverse was structured as described below.

Planet Types
[
]
There were various planet types within the Foodverse that had special properties and tastes. These include the following:
Vegetable Planet
[
]
These, like all planets, come in different sub-varieties of lettuce, beetroot, etc. However, they all share almost every property, except for the taste of the planet itself. These planets were all nearly inhospitable due to all the water being trapped inside the planet's core and being much less frequent in the crust, where it was too hot for anything to evolve before the next million
OYC
. Vegetable planets which did not orbit stars had the same problem with cold temperatures, as they got all of their heat form their stars and trapped it
too well
. For some reason, they were also the fastest rotating planets in the Foodverse.
Fruit Planet
[
]
Fruit Planets were very, VERY unlike the Vegetable planets in every way. They almost always had life due to abundant surface dew radiating from the core of the planet. They had perfect temperature control even in the coldest Foodverse voids. This has made many theories state that Fruit Planets were sentient, but it was revealed it's just a large amount of very accurate physics. All aside from one Fruit Planet, though - the Pomegranate Planet.
Pomegranate Planet
[
]
This was the only planet in the Foodverse to survive the onslaught of Candyland's terraforming due to its absolute uniqueness. This planet was recorded to have a small amount of sentience that grew every few hundred millennia, and much more rapidly if it was communicated with. Today, the planet sports no life due to its activity and has a humongous house in the Foodverse somewhere, along with mind-controlled limbs. It lives with a large amount of civilians and scientists, reporting that it is very satisfied with the life it has.
Meat Planet
[
]
These planets were almost always home to small organisms such as bacteria, flies and meat eating worms. This planet was the one that was the most often eaten by far, due to their perfect warm temperature, moist environment, and nutritious makeup. They seem to negate this with a simple Multidon machine in their cores that's always pushing meat out for the planet to keep going. It has lots of extra mass due to the mass of dead life becoming part of the red meat. Any mass that would make it too heavy is flung off into space, somehow, as to avoid getting too massive.
Sugar Planet
[
]
Sugar Planets, like Candyland, used to be the rarest in the Foodverse and usually orbited Sugarstars. Sugar planets are made out of various candy compositions which would melt your teeth such as chocolate hills, sugar water oceans, and ice cream tundras. They also sport the most life by far and have the only sapient species in the Foodverse on them, although the Candymen were the only ones to fit the planet. Oddly enough, some Sugar Planets have actual, non-edible terrain in their makeup. This is one of the greates Foodverse mysteries, behind the sentient Pomegranate Planet.
Stars
[
]
Stars of the Foodverse, while less varied, are still just as important as planets to everything, just as with a normal
Universe
. Below, the stars are listed.
Sugarstars
[
]
Sugarstars are balls of very hot sugar and caramel that are very dense and small for their weight. They radiate heat much more evenly than the other type of star, the Spudstar. It has been noted that the cooler Sugarstars have no caramel despite still being at the boiling point for sugar. This seems to come from a glob of very odd
Primordium Theta
at the center of every Sugarstar, and in this verse, it makes all sugar close to it retain solid form in an extreme amount of heat. Aside from that, due to the nature of the Sugarstars solar flares cannot occur for some reason. Perhaps it is some Primordium Theta B.
Spudstars
[
]
These potato-based examples of oddly specific stars are located much more rarely than the Sugarstars, as they are hardly stars. Their size is star-like, but they're just large slightly warm potatoes floating in the Foodverse surrounded by slightly warmer mashed versions of its own mass. Anything that orbits a Spudstar is almost  never going to have life even if it was an otherwise perfect candidate for such. The best use for these so far has been feeding citizens.
Hegg
[
]
Hegg is a weird verse inside the Foodverse, and it will have more information on its own page!
