Tremendous-1500
is one of the biggest "normal"
Universes
known to exist. It's contained within the
biggest
megaverse
and the
biggest
multiverse
.
Its name is quite easy to understand. "Tremendous" because of its size, and "1500" because of it being around 1.5 quintillion light years large.
The main
civilization
that lives in this
verse
is known as the Tremendousians. The civilization has tried to expand the universe, but to no avail. The biggest thing IN this universe is the Leo-Taurus Hypercluster Supercomplex.
Tremendous-1500 is often mistaken for a Multiverse because of its size.
