Verses in the anti void are divided by 3 types:
Glitch zones
- they somehow formed random glitched
living multiverses
.
There are also zones where there are their own kinds of concepts are nothing. For example, where nothing has the concept of everything. this makes the absence of something everything. And even more. That is, an infinitely dense thing in which even
THIS
cannot fit.
And perhaps there are also universes with fractional dimensions that work like a buggy space that does everything.
Cosmic entity

Non-existent
: They don't exist. They are like observers who are dealing with something that cannot be interacted with.
Glitched
: Like their name says, they're glitched and crave the destruction of those who came here.
Glitched souls
[
]
The glitched soul is a property of these voids.Â All living beings that stay here outside of Voids begin to glitch and change their color to red-black. They also begin to crave the destruction of universes. They have threads with which they can control souls and destroy them.
Someone thought of adding a miniature copy of the anti-void to the undertale multiverse. Guess what happened?
