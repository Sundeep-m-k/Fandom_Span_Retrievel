The "Perfect" being is the
concept
of an
entity
that surpases everyone in
fiction
,
real life
, ane even entities such as
Jerald
and
„ÄåGod„Äç
, thus being
the highest
being.
But before, you can say "um actually „ÄåGod„Äçis a real being while this being is fiction" or "Jerald goes unfathomably above every single layer of the "
Allsphere
", which is
the collection of every single
universe
,
multiverse
,
megaverse
, dimension (alternate or pocket), and
realm
. This includes not only
Marvel Comics, but also DC Comics, Image, Dark Horse, Wildstorm, Archie, Harvey, Shueisha, Boom Studios, Rebellion, Dynamite, IDW, Graphic India, Derby Pop, Vertigo, Oni Press, Udon, Valiant, Kodansha, Shogakukan,
and every universe ever mentioned or seen (and an infinite amount never mentioned or seen) including our own world.
" (gosh that's long), the perfect being is also the lowest being, that means that even a baby, no, a FREAKING
ATOM
can kill the perfect being.
but why? Doesn't that mean that the "Perfect" Being isn't actually "Perfect"? Well, the perfect being is both the highest and lowest at the same time, how? We don't know, our brains have a limit, even the smartest beings get confused with this question.
The God Rock Paradox
[
]
(note the text here is altered from Zack D. Films short "
The God Rock Paradox ü§Ø
")
Can an all powerful
god
create a rock so heavy, that even he/she/them/it can't lift it? if so there's something god can't lift which means god is not all powerful or perfect, but if god cannot create a rock that he/she/them/it can't lift then that means god is not all powerful or perfect because there is something he cannot create. to be truly all powerful god would need to defy logic, by creating a rock he/she/them/it cannot lift, but still able to lift it.
(This is still a
WIP
, so your help could make this article better)
if you haven't noticed, this is just god from religions, but is called The "Perfect" Being in this wiki, like, how you, the user, is called
„ÄåGod„Äç
in this wiki. (the reason I didn't wrote the title as Jesus or Allah because I already made pages of them, but it got deleted, so I used the same format as the
„ÄåGod„Äç
page for this page.)
