stars
. In 62

Flat

This type is the rarest type in The
Foodverse
, they have no precise orbit and because of this they ususally fall into their star and are destroyed at the age of ~50
OYC
.
Planet
[
]
This type is average in number, as it has a stable core and everything in it is stable. The only thing is that it does not have an atmosphere and there is no life in it.
Tafarnout planets are are usually in "cycles of implosion" due to the pressure from their star, with each cycle lasting around 510 years.
Asteroid
[
]
They're just like any random asteroid in shape, and they are usually hit by other asteroid tafarnouts.
