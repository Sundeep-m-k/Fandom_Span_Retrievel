The Stageverse is very weird, it is pretty evil and 14.7K stageverses are not evil, they are in the same
Hypervelogical
verse, the verse is called HVL-N5C112+. We dont have much information about it so we dont have so much intresting here if you want, Stageverses have rainows on it like Levelverse but shifted, here lives rainbow entities their body have the color of rainbow, they are very nice and respectful. Stageverse contains Levelverses and contained by Gigalevelogicals. The main raison why it’s rainbowish because it have
