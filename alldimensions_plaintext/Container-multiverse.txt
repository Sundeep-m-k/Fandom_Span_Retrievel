Copies of many different unique

A
Container-multiverse
is a special type of
Multiverse
which is very big compared to the average multiverse. It contains many different copies of unique verses, such as the
Bicoverse
, the
Lȍmaverse
, the
Lightverse
, the
Deltaverse
, the
Lifeverse
, the
Lone world
, etc. Container-multiverses are thought by many entities to be 'showcases' of different verses. The different verses are merely copies, and do not affect the actual verse in any way. On the outside, it appears to be a box with a side open on the 'top'. They are almost always contained directly by an
Omniverse
, but sometimes a rogue Container-multiverse can be found in a
Box
.
