Anaginonasedia
[
]
Anaginonasedia is a weird paradox that contains cardinals that are stated to be infinite. With those numbers being inside of here, it is not imagined how it would look like, but a unimaginable amount of proper size of "a" cardinal. Paradoxes inside of this are not infinite in size, so there are things that are bigger than it. This means it can break logic itself by existing towards it. This functions properly for no reason, and cant be explained on how. Thus, it is for a important part about this paradox that is moving around at 1,000 MPH. The one who creates it is none other than
MyChipsAreHot
, regardless if it comes to making a page look bad, or good. Since of its weird shape, it can stretch itself apart to many explosion across it.
This paradox contains another important one named "Bioheahntigoba".

Bioheahntigoba

Another weird paradox that goes 100 MPH inside of Anaginonasedia. It is a type of container that can breach into problems so it makes it heard to tear apart. But it could tear apart of i wanted to, but its not yet confirmed to do that. While it remembers binary codes from the farthest computer with future techs, it not only does that, but it gains recovery back from getting memory wiped by something. It can learn from other objects, regardless if below, or above, it can see through them, and make them absorb each other into a thing that cant be studied at all.
This one has another weird paradox names "Casinognohince"
Casinognohince

A weird paradox inside of Bioheahntigoba that goes at 10 MPH inside of it. This paradox has logic to it, that is randomized to switch over again, and energize the
Omniverse
. Its curses may be deadly due to the fact that its atoms can destroy multiverses, and rewrite any story belonging to another. This can come apply to breaking laws of physics dominating the surface of walls. It can exist out of the Anaginonasedia, and go back to it again if it wanted to. This can change thoughts about things, to another as it can.
