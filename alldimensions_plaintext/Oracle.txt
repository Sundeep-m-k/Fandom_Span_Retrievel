Oracle AKA Emperor of Time, is the entity responsible for keeping time as it is. He is primordial and lives in
The Apex
. His power is endless, boundless, unlimited and even timeless. His creator
Apex
also lives in The Apex and has power beyond dimensions.
Oracle is one of the 5 brothers of Apex, the other ones being Enigma ( Creator of Light ) , Atom ( Keeper of the elements ) , Phantom ( Holder of the natural forces ) , Doctor V ( Guardian of Life ).
Oracle holding time and dimensions together
Power : Dimensional
Speed : Beyond quantum
Age : Primordial
Death : Eternal
If Oracle somehow dies, time will become distorted and dimensions will break apart. A cosmic entity once tried to stop Oracle, but failed and has been banished from this realm. As of today, Apex gave his creators a little protection : a paradoxical relic which bents time for who whoever tries to get close to the 5 brothers.
