Randomuser66's Space Bottles
, also known as
Space Bottles
, are the containment of the
Beeg Clusters
. They're similar to the
Bottles
, but on a much, MUCH larger scale.
Space Bottles are necessary for space-time to continue inside them, so breaking their glass is no option, since if the glass was broken, it would rebuild itself due to space-time laws.
Name origins
[
]
They received their name after the
TOG
known as
Randomuser66
decided to name these after him, while also basing off the already known Bottles.
Exiting a Space Bottle
[
]
The only way to exit these bottles is through their neck, which is a very small part of them, but since there is no lid it is easy to escape through there.
Liquid contents
[
]
Just like normal bottles, Space Bottles are capable of containing liquids inside their hollow structure.
Most Space Bottles have blue beer inside of them, which suprisingly can naturally evaporate and/or solidify. The beer is also always found at the bottom due to the size change in the gas stage.
A fewer amount of them contain water instead, though adding large amounts of components to that sustance will make those Space Bottles turn into the more common beer-filled ones.
