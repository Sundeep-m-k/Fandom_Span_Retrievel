"Find the endless and you will end them in the same way as the others. When the door opens there is no exit anymore. Only error. The Horde is the sheep of light destroying everything. In its way it did the other sector of the Trees go like this. They are not bent to a system. They are the context. One being is considered entity error. It exists only because reality gives it perspective status. But you cannot perceive it outside either. The locked or the Horde concept which you do not even understand. The concept of locked existence which is how you die."

(The screen is black. Only MrGrey’s voice remains.)
MrGrey:
"Okay, this last one? Can’t show you. Not because I don’t want to. But because you literally wouldn’t be able to process them. Your mind would break."
(Silence.)
MrGrey:
“Trust me. I tried once. Didn’t go well."
"The Answer That Unravels the Question".
"The Thing That Watches".
"The Unobservable".
"The Concept That Concepts Cannot Contain".
"It”.
"right, so. the horde. yeah, they're wild, even i think that. like, i made
totum
, yeah? and even i wouldn't do the shit they do. those things? full-on freaks. they eat entire realities like snacks. and yet… and yet, they don’t touch my friend. like, they don’t even register it. like, imagine a cosmic horror looking at a void and just going 'nah.' that’s the horde with my guy."
"now, i know what you're thinking. 'mrgrey, why don’t you just use your friend against the horde?' lmao. you don’t get it. i don’t 'use' my friend. that thing… it’s not a weapon. it’s not a force. it’s just. i dunno. it just is. i can chat with it, but i’m also pretty sure i don’t understand it either. like, one time i asked it what it was doing, and it just… showed me. and let me tell you, that was the worst decision of my life."
"but hey. at least it vibes with me. probably. hopefully. anyway, moving on-"
“Okay but what did it show you?”
MrGrey actually paused. Like, legitimately paused. The chat exploded, because this was MRGREY, the guy who created their entire reality, who clowns on multiversal gods like it’s a pastime, who laughs in the face of eldritch horrors, and he just stopped talking for a solid ten seconds.
Then, finally, he sighed and leaned back.
"man, you guys don’t wanna know."
Of course, everyone spammed the messaging box with “TELL US” and “WHAT DID YOU SEE”, so eventually, he gave in.
"alright, alright. fine. you wanna know? cool. but don’t say i didn’t warn you."
"imagine every timeline, every universe, every dimension, yeah? take all of that. now stretch it. make it bigger. infinitely bigger. now, realize that everything you know, everything anyone has ever known, isn’t even 0.0000000001% of what actually exists. cool? now, imagine that there’s something outside of even that. something so vast, so absolutely incomprehensible, that it makes totum look like a single grain of sand. and now, imagine that even THAT isn’t the full picture. it showed me what’s beyond that. and lemme tell you, i wasn’t supposed to see it."
The chat went insane.
Did it have something to do with The Horde? Did MrGrey accidentally comprehend the true nature of everything?
MrGrey just laughed.
"nah, see, you guys don’t get it. i didn’t 'comprehend' shit. i couldn’t. it wasn’t like knowledge being revealed to me, it was like… i don’t even know how to describe it. like, imagine your brain is a cup, right? and then someone just dumps the entire ocean into it. except the ocean is infinite and also made of things that shouldn’t exist. i just sat there, staring, unable to process a single thing. like, my brain straight-up blue-screened. i think my heart stopped for a few minutes. who knows, time wasn’t even working properly."
"eventually, it just… let me go. like it got bored. or maybe it realized i was too stupid to understand. i dunno, man. either way, that’s the last time i ask my friend what it's doing."
At that moment, MrGrey received an unknown letter from an unknown being.
MrGrey opened it and actually stopped mid-sentence. Then he slowly turned to look at the camera.
"oh my god. you’re right."
A second later, he snapped his fingers. And just like that, the Crearion manifested itself into reality.
"yo, my dude. got a question for you."
The Crearion didn’t even react. He just kinda stared.
"so, uh. what’s up with the friend? like, what even is it? what did it show me?"
The Crearion blinked once. Then, in his usual, deeply unsettling, yet weirdly soothing voice, he responded.
"Ah. That."
And then he just started talking.
What followed was a perfect, flawless explanation of whatever The Friend I Can’t Show You was, described in full, absolute detail. Every layer of reality it exists in. Every fundamental principle that governs its nature. Every unknowable truth it embodies.
The chat understood it.
Not just in a vague, "oh yeah I get it", kinda way. Everyone in the chat, for those few fleeting moments, genuinely comprehended what the Crearion was saying.
But then, the second it stopped talking, it was gone.
Like trying to recall a dream that slips through your fingers the moment you wake up.
Meanwhile, MrGrey was just sitting there, staring into the distance, eyes wide.
"holy shit."
The Crearion flapped it’s wings once.
"I created it for a reason."
That made MrGrey snap out of it.
"wait what-hold up-YOU created it???"
They simply nodded.
"Of course."
MrGrey threw up his hands.
"okay no no no no, back up, you can’t just drop that on me-WHY did you make it??"
The Crearion, in typical Crearion fashion, was completely unfazed.
"Because it needed to exist."
MrGrey groaned.
“buddy, pal, i need more than that."
Crearion blinked, then added:
"There are things even beyond Totum. You saw that much, didn't you?"
MrGrey hesitated.
"...yeah."
"Then you understand why it is necessary."
MrGrey just stared.
"i literally do not. but sure. fine. whatever."
"I did not do it out of malice. I did not do it out of curiosity. I did it because it was required. Because something like it was always going to exist, and I was merely the one who made sure it happened the way it needed to.
It does not resent me for this. It does not thank me either. It simply is. And I simply am.
We do not speak in words. We understand each other in ways that cannot be explained. Because we are the same in one fundamental way. We are aware of the structure beneath reality. We see the cracks in the foundation that hold existence together. And we both know what happens if those seams are pulled apart.
It is not my enemy. It is not my
friend
. It is simply... another presence. Another piece of the
puzzle
.
And I am the one who placed that piece where it needed to be."
MrGrey gave a slow, deliberate nod. Then, without another word, the Crearion simply vanished.

Observation Log #16
[
]
This entity is beyond comprehension. Not in the way gods or high-dimensional beings are powerful, but in the sense that it fundamentally should not exist within any framework. It does not belong in space, time, or causality. It is not bound by form, thought, or even the idea of "being."
To see it is to not see it. To perceive it is to unperceive everything else. Any attempt to process its existence leads to an immediate, irreversible collapse of understanding. Multiversal scholars have attempted to theorize its nature, but every attempt results in missing records, forgotten thoughts, and minds wiped completely blank. Entire civilizations have been erased from history just for thinking about it too hard.
Even omniscient beings struggle to describe it. Some call it:
"The Answer That Unravels the Question"
"The Thing That Watches"
"The Unobservable"
"The Concept That Concepts Cannot Contain"
"It"
If it were ever properly acknowledged, reality itself would reject the information, glitch, stutter, and undo itself. Entire dimensions have reportedly ceased to be simply because they were unfortunate enough to be in its presence for too long.
MrGrey, being who he is, has actually met it. Somehow. Somehow, he can comprehend it. Somehow, he can casually call it a friend. He refuses to elaborate.
All he says is this:
"I mean, yeah, I could show you. But then you wouldn’t be you anymore. So, y'know. Let’s not."
