Fricknian Space

A Fricknian Space is a type of space inside a
Fricknia
. All objects inside a Fricknian Space have a defined size and an ordered dimensionality. For example, everything that exists within Alphasm's imagination is Fricknian.

A Vsauian space is a type of space that exists outside of Alphasm. It is characterized by not following typical Fricknian dimensionality rules.
The most defining characteristic of a Vsauian space is the existence of a
complex dimensionality.
That is, that the dimensionality of an object in a Vsauian space can be represented as a complex number
a+bi
. An immediate consequence is the lack of a concrete dimensionality hierarchy, due to the lack of order in
C
{\displaystyle \mathbb{C}}
. This raises several questions on the definition of “containment” in a Vsauian space.
Containment in a Vsauian space
[
]
Objects in a Vsauian space are not constrained by size, and in a Vsauian space
V
, an object with a definite higher dimensionality contains all definitely lower dimensionality objects in
V
. If an object has a larger real part but smaller imaginary part (or vice versa), then it is said that each object both contains and is contained by the other. For example, an object with dimensionality a+bi contains and is contained by an object with dimensionality (a+1)+(b-1)i. Two objects with equal dimensionalities are said to be equal, and neither contain, nor not contain the other.
