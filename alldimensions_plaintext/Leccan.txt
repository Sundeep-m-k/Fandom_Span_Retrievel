Leccan is the verse that contains every laccen and every verse that contains them (up to this point). It changes in shape every second going in random order between all of the platonic and kepler solids. It is now infested with tourists for some reason, and that is causing major damage to the ball supply. However, more balls are being created than they are being destroyed, and the ball population is steadily rising. There's barely anything to say about this verse, so it's just a stub article for the time being.
