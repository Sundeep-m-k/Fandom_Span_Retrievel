Soul of Eternity
: Welcome to your new form. Hope you like it!
BEAN MAN BUT AWESOME
: I thought you were a cosmetic, though?
Soul of Eternity: I am, but since I have finally been activated by a god. I shall talk.
BEAN MAN BUT AWESOME: welp, now I have to leave. I heard a creature is having a power surge, so I need to collect some of its energy so I can save it and I get more powerful.
Soul of Eternity: well, bye now!
BEAN MAN BUT AWESOME flies away to the sight
