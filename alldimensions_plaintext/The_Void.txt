The last verses
This is essentially what comes after the end. Imagine that the
universe
is the biggest thing, but what's next? An emptiness that cannot be described by ordinals. This is beyond of size. If there is a "biggest thing", then after it comes an emptiness.
THIS IS
VOID
. It is artificial and specially created. And what about the true "endless emptiness"? it's an
anti-void
.
Since this void is artificial, it was made not so big.  the true void must be bigger than
THIS box
. (
no pseudo pshycial wikiverse end
).
And it's also the reverse axiom of
nothing
. That is, it means that after everything (the last verse), it contains itself 0 times and has many different details, which forms the concept of "emptiness after everything".
To describe the consequences of the inverse axiom, nothing and this place need a book, so I described it briefly and with inaccuracies.
