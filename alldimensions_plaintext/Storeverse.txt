Well, it is the next step up from the
Appleverse
. It still doesn't do much, since it is just a poor store, but it doesn't even sell anything but apples. And the apples aren't even good.
But really, the beauty of making a store is not making money from it. That is what it seems, but it is not true. The best part of making a store is the interesting architecture behind it. If you put this at a verse level, it gets much more interesting.
Even though the Appleverse isn't really anything special besides its simplicity, the Storeverse still has cool stuff because of the cool "broken" architecture. Verse architecture isn't common at all, which makes this more interesting.
However, it is not as interesting as the other ones which all also have architecture. It is like these verses will get progressively more interesting as they go onÂ :)
