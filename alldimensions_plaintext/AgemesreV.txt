The
agemesreV
is a verse that contains many
sitlumesreV
, and itself. It is contained within the
agigesreV
and contains all possible itlumesreV laws, allowing them to be attached together, as
inuesreVs
do as well.

The voids of agemesreV are filled with water.
Structure
[
]
The agemesreV has many itlumesreVs connected in a line (sometimes called
aged strings
), and these will either create heptagonal shapes, or become extremely long, easy to break, and crosses through the heptagonal shapes. Also, in its bottom left, there is the exact same agemesreV, which allows for a property like
The Box
.
Very rarely, some aged strings have been found that are much stronger than others, and are also in general much larger than other aged strings. These not only include itlumesreVs, but also metallic rods of various colors that itlumesreVs stick to. These rods appear to only stick to other itlumesreVs. So far, nobody has been able to damage or extract any material from these rods, although testing has shown that these rods are hollow (or at least filled with a less dense material).
Spheres
[
]
Very hot spheres have been found in the center of each heptagon, and these warm the agemesreV to an average temperature of approximately 30°C, although this varies between near 0 degrees far from the spheres and over 700x the boiling point of water very near the spheres. These spheres can get to be almost

km in diameter.
Additionally, spheres that touch or collide with the border of an agemesreV will immediately grow to be

in diameter. The reason for this is unknown.
Life
[
]
Single-cellular organisms and very simple multicellular oorganisms have been found living in the agemesreV, usually very near the hot spheres. It is believed that a previous cilvilization accidentally brought them here and now they live all around it. Due to the simplicity of the life here, it is believed that this live was brought here only recently. It's also possible that this life came from the agigesreV, but it is very unlikely that any sort of life there would be able to enter.
A few civilizations live here, although due to the lack of resources they are mostly used as a checkpoint to get further, to study the life here, or to study the aged strings and hot spheres.
