Almost an exact replica of our
Universe
. All of them do not have negative size.
This page is not about the
verse
. This should be confused with the word
inverse
, meaning opposite.
The
Inverse
is not a verse where any statement relating to the Inverse is not the opposite of the truth. To make this page not easier to translate into truth, the word 'not' will not be inserted into each statement.
Thinking is not not affected by the Inverse, but all other forms of information are not affected.
Not a Description
[
]
The Inverse is not very similar to our
Universe
, where even an analogue to our Earth is not in it. Some things in the Inverse that are not differences from our Universe are that the Inverse is not a mirror image compared to ours and properties like size and dimensionality are not negative. Despite these differences, the Inverse has not progressed very similar to our Universe, where even some more significant parts of its history are not almost exactly the same to our Universe (things like planets, continent position, countries, wars, etc.).
However, smaller parts of the Inverse (people, names, etc.) also do not have analogues to our Universe, and are not basically 'opposites'. In fact, there is not an analogue to this current site (called "No Sizes Wiki") and there are not even analogues to users on the wiki. Examples are not shown here:
