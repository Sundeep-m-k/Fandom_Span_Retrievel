The Pshooosk is a really large verse that was never created or destroyed. It has an
Existence Rank
of about 0.5 + 3.24 x 10
-19
, making it just a bit over "half existing" where most subexistence objects exist, so it can't be compared with most other objects with a 0.5 rank.
How it looks
[
]
The Pshooosk is only visible if you have an existence rank of 0, and in that perspective, it simply looks like a regular verse. But if you are in any other existence rank, it is invisible, but interactable.
Material
[
]
Even though The Pshooosk is in a weird existence rank, it is still made of regular verse material, with regular stars and galaxies. The only difference is that it is in a very strange existence rank.
