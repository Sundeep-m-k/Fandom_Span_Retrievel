The regular polyhedra are those that have congruent and regular
vertices
,
faces
and
edges
. They are listed here, along with their

Kepler-Poinsot
[

The four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra are concave, intersect themselves, and some have star polygons as faces rather than convex ones.

Abstract
[
]
Abstract polyhedra are topologically equivalent to tilings of hyperbolic space. Therefore, they are not considered part of the nine main regular polyhedra, but are listed nonetheless.

Spherical
[
]
Spherical polyhedra can only exist on the surface of a sphere, and are degenerate in normal Euclidean space. Therefore, they are not considered part of the nine main regular polyhedra.
