Universes
The Polynomialverse can contain from 2-7 different universes. Polynomialverses with more than 5 Universes are considered unsafe as the universes are usually to close to each other, the only way a Polynomialverse with 5+ universes is safe is if the Polynomialverse is very large or the universes are very small. Polynomialverses with more than 7 Universes are very uncommon as the universes will usually bump into each other and the edge of the Polynomialverse and break through causing the Polynomialverse to slowly disappear over time and leaving the universes damaged by all the impacts.
Polynomialverses can be contained by any -verse as they are not normally in a specific -verse. Polynomialverses are very rare usually not being within range of 5 Quadrillion Light Years of each other
