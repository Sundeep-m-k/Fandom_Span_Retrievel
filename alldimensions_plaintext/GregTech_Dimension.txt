History
[
]
The history of this dimension is not very well known. It is believed that it was created 900,000
OYC
ago. The city was probably inhabited for some centuries by an unknown species, but some horrific cataclysm happened a few thousands of years ago, leaving it destroyed and uninhabited. The cataclysm is not well-defined, although it may be a meteor shower due to the shape of the craters. It was discovered by an unsuspecting entity that traveled to the wrong dimension.
Buildings

Picture of some of the shelves in the Bazaar
Le Grand Machine Bazaar is a big shop that has most of all useful machines. Each machine starts at 100€ and increments by 80€ for every extra voltage level. The person who keeps this shop is an Enuoc called Pora'anil. It is structured like a 3D tiling, with the rooms being connected by doors and the occasional elevator.
