Rouge Verses
are verses that are randomly scattered around the
Our Omniverse
and Other
Omniverses
. but they can usually be found anywhere else, just, anywhere. They are also divided into 5 Types of Rouge Verses. They can usually appear anywhere. However, if you go far enough, like farther than loops and bigger things, you can see that Rouge verses don't appear anymore. Most of them have wierd names, like
Yocidebeghisdghiverse
,
Luvcaverse
, Or
Tumadejuverse
. Their kardashev scale is always 4 because they always contain
galaxies
, because their kardashev scale is 3. However, sometimes they dont contain any, but they still have a karadhev scale of 4 because some Stars cluster.

Levels of Rouge Verses

Level 1 Rouge Verses
[
]
Level 1 Rouge Verses are regular Rouge verses that are found basically anywhere. They can be microscopic, like
plank length
-level microscopic or even
protoverse
-level microscopic, to any number lower than Infinity. They are found everywhere in the Omniverse and are almost always with life. around 99.9943% of them have life. the other 0.0067% have no life.
Level 2 Rouge Verses
[
]
Level 2 Rouge Verses are Rouge Verses that are FAR Larger than Regular Level 1 Rouge Verses. They are bigger than the
Omniverse
and can be as big as
Cantor's Absolute Infinity
Light Years In Size.
Level 3 Rouge Verses
[
]
Level 3 Rouge Verses are even bigger than Level 2 Rouge Verses. They are Absolute Light Years in Size to the point where Size no longer has a meaning. This also transcends the largest fictional thing Anything can make.
Level 4 Rouge Verses
[
]
Level 4 Rouge Verses transcend logic and anything else, and are anything larger than the upper limit of Level 3 Rouge Verses.
Level 5 Rouge Verses
[
]
Level 5 Rouge Verses are the Absolute and Utter pinnacle of size itself. Transcending Level 4 Rouge Verses is an understatement for how large Level 5 Rouge Verses are. They are even larger than
Nothing
itself.
Level 5+ Rouge Verses

I don't even know where to begin at this point, these "Things" are so gargantuan, that they can even be classifyed as a "Verse" anymore. After The Levels of rouge verses end, Rouge Verses no longer appear. I cannot tell you if they are larger thing, because they can't even be mentioned of their existence in the wiki itself. So that means that the largest of the Levels of The Rouge Verses are the largest things that I can mention on the entire wiki.
