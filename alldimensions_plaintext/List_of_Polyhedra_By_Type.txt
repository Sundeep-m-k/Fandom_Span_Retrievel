Rotatopic polyhedra
are polyhedra formed from the product of multiple hyperspheres. There are exactly three rotatopic polyhedra, listed below along with their constituent hyperspheres (using

Antiprism polyhedra are formed by connecting two polygons through space with alternating triangles. Similar to the prism polyhedra, there are a countably infinite number of these.
Some significant antiprisms are:
Tetrahedron
(digon-based)
Octahedron
(triangle-based)
Square Antiprism
Pentagonal Antiprism
Hexagonal Antiprism
Heptagonal Antiprism
Octagonal Antiprism
Enneagonal Antiprism
Decagonal Antiprism
