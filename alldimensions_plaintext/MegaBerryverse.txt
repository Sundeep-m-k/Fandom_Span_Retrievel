A
MegaBerryverse
or
Megaberryverse
is a much larger version of the
Berryverse
, containing the Berry Paradox of
Berryverses
. Every Berryverse in the MegaBerryverse is a different version, and can also alter the logic of the MegaBerryverse. Due to this phenomenon, it satisfies a countably infinite number of conditions. The number of conditions is arbitrary and changes every moment, but it is always countably infinite.
Conditions
[
]
The amount of conditions is usually determined by its surroundings, such as the condition of how many fixed points the MegaBerryverse has relative to another verse. However, the amount of conditions is also increasing because it always has the condition of having had the condition a few planck times ago.
The MegaBerryverse also alters reality in a sense, to be able to satisfy the countably infinite number of conditions.
The countably infinite conditions will also cause some of the conditions to contradict themselves, so it is usually a bad idea to interact with the MegaBerryverse. It will satisfy any condition you could possibly think of, such as having the ability to kill you, alter reality, destroy reality itself, etc. The reason it hasn't already destroyed all of reality at this point is because it is the MegaBerryverse, and it repeats itself infinite times, so some of the MegaBerryverse copies have the condition of preventing others from having that condition.
The only condition that the MegaBerryverse can't satisfy is the condition of not being on the All Dimensions wiki.
Relations with the
Negationverse
[
]
While the
Negationverse
would logically be able to remove any of the MegaBerryverse's conditions, it isn't really able to, because of the other MegaBerryverses instantly adding those conditions back. It would theoretically be possible if you could make the negations adjust a a countably infinite amount of times, as the MegaBerryverse only has a countably infinite number of conditions. However, since the
Negationverse
is language based, this isn't possible, as you can't have an irrational meaning in any finite language.
