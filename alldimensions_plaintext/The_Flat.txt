The Flat is composed of many copies of
The Brick
. The bricks are connected by tiny, thin bridges called Bricdkges. The Bricks in this wall are all mostly the same. Also The Flat has 2 sides: a floor side and the ceiling side. The floor side is unbreakable, but we know that it is can be broken with The Fhalmmaert. The ceiling side cannot be touched, however we know that it is solid and real.The Flat is also home to lots of
