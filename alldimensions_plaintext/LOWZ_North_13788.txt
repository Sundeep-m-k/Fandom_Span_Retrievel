One of largest known voids, containing 109,066 known galaxies.
The LOWZ North 13788 Void is the largest known voids in the observable universe. It is part of a vast, underdense region in space, where the typical distribution of galaxies is significantly sparse compared to the surrounding regions. This cosmic void was cataloged and studied as part of efforts to map the large-scale structure of the universe, particularly focusing on low redshift surveys.
