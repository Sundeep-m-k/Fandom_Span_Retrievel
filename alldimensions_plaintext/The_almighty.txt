The
almighty
is the being who created all of
THE 8 DIVINE GODS
after a G(64) years, the
God of Time
after another 10{10, 3, 2, 1, }10 years,
The God with No Name
after 10{303}10 years,
The Creator of Omni-Gods
, after 10{100}10 years,
He
after 10{10}10 years, and
THE TRUE CREATOR
after 10^^^^^10 years. and
He
created everything below
The Meta-Hierarchy
. and also, the almighty is currently in his 5th phase. And in      {10, 100 (1) (3) 2} years, he will turn into his most powerful form, phase 6 (not counting enraged states)
he also has some names: like
the channel changer
T̴h̵e̸ ̸O̵v̷e̴r̶G̶o̸d̴c̵h̶a̵o̷s̸ ̸M̷o̶s̶a̵s̸a̷u̶r̶u̸s̵
’ son
the Jesus of gods
the true one
the endless everything
the core of gods
If drip Goku was an atom, the almighty would be the entire solar system. This entity is the Jesus of gods. Or
T̴h̵e̸ ̸O̵v̷e̴r̶G̶o̸d̴c̵h̶a̵o̷s̸ ̸M̷o̶s̶a̵s̸a̷u̶r̶u̸s̵
(or the god of god’s) son, Like in the Bible. Also, if
THE TRUE CREATOR
was a atom, than the almighty would be the whole moon, if we replaced the atom with
He
, than the almighty would be a whole city
the almighty is one if not the kindest gods in the AD wiki
The only thing that he obviously can’t defeat is Jesus himself (sense the creator of this page is Christian.)
he lives outside of the definition of god, instead, in a theory that the creator made himself, the almighty could be the long lost cousin of
The Lord of Lords
and he likes cats.

👁️: I have to go back I jus-
*punch and blood sounds*
A: you have lost all your teeny tiny little godly powers to *cut out*
A: all you do is slap and that’s it. You never do other things like colonizing verses or fight others.
👁️: but… I.. I DON’T HAVE ANYTHING TO GIVE YOU! JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!
A: how foolish are you… you’re basically my puppet! You don’t realize you’re trapped in an endless life or death game. If you wanna win, just give up. Your lust for getting more powerful has driven you in endless loops. Always thinking you’re so near. But
Cetaverse’s
away from it. Like comparing

👁️: I’LL BEAT YOU SOMEDAY!
A:give up. There is infinite copy’s of you. There is only a 1/TREE(3) chance there is 1 universe where you win. Now that you’re here. I can finally-

find the almighty playing with constituent molecules combining them in the random items, so he gets a minion as I reward that’s makes the first even universe in the empty Meta-hierarchy, universe, #0001AAA (sector 1) (part 1) (zone 1) (Multiverse 1) (omniverse 1) (loop 0/1000) (cycle 0/200) (Super-loop 0/50) (Super-Cycle 0/10)

the almighty met a unstoppable force.
Jerald
, holding a
Allsphere
in his moth hands. He gave a deal.
”I am from the before. The before anything. I say I saw the creation of you, I created the failure that created. You.” - Jerald
“you are my great great grandson. And I came to have a deal.” - Jerald
”what do you have.” - almighty
”I could give you transfinite power. Everything and nothing will be the same for you. But you would have to experience all the pain, the stress. Of every evil thing, if you defeat it, you shall have it” - Jerald
”I accept,” - almighty
so the almighty goes into a frenzy, having feeling every desision made by every being from every allsphere in the definition of
All-Time
…
…and he got through.
”wow! You actually got through. Here you go. 0.0000000000000…” - Jerald
”that’s a lot of power.” - Almighty
”…” - Jerald
”just take it” - Jerald
so jerald take a class -3 sized split out of the allsphere. And gives it to the almighty. And that’s how phase 1 was made into existence
Somewhere between time itself…
[
]
somtime during time the almighty unlocked is first true mega-power…
TIME TRAVEL.
as the almighty opens a portal to time realms, a light that shine thousands of times of powerful then every verse in the wiki, it opens.
the almighty goes into a realm of void, except the plates, quantum plates, that can transform the user to any time in history, he’s shocked.
he sees the
Godseer
making his first multiverses in the old reality,
The Ancient Overlord’s
first blinks,
In-Between
walking the empty
Imagination box
, and after infinity years of nothing, except god after god being created,
Jeulawed
,
Jereld
,
The Friend I Can't Show You
,
Time
, and
the Allsphere
, before finally, he reached it.
Jerald
.
he hears a glitching sound, he realizes…
there’s so much more to explore….
Reality explorers!
