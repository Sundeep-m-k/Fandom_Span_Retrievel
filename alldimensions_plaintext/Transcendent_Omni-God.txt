Transcendent Omni-Gods
are sentient auras that surpass even the power level of all the other
cosmic entities
of the
All-Dimensions cosmos
combined. They can change what some things have always been and make new things regardless of logic. They surpass even a level of Author Authority in V&D's
Omnipotence Hierarchy
, but are still way lower than a power level of Transfictional Author Authority. There are different ranks of Transcendent Omni-Gods, which we will go over them.
Power Levels
Gallery
Powerless
[
]
Powerless Transcendent Omni-Gods are Transcendent Omni-Gods that cannot change things and make things. There are different levels of power here as well.
True Powerless
[
]
These are Powerless Transcendent Omni-Gods that cannot come back as a new Transcendent Omni-God until their powerless time expires(blocked or banned).
Basic
[
]
Basic Transcendent Omni-Gods are Transcendent Omni-Gods that can actually do things, but are still ruled over by some of the higher ranked Transcendent Omni-Gods(may be a normal registered member).
Administrative
[
]
Administrative Transcendent Omni-Gods can do things and change the ranks of lower ranked Transcendent Omni-Gods to another rank below Administrative(administrator). They also have Moderative powers.
Bureaucratic
[
]
Bureaucratic TOGs are the same as Administrative Transcendent Omni-Gods except they can also rank lower ranked Transcendent Omni-Gods to Administrative or Bureaucratic rank(bureaucrat). However they cannot revert the rank change once a Basic Transcendent Omni-God is ranked to a Bureaucrat. Only Ultimate Transcendent Omni-Gods(FANDOM Staff, specifically) can revert it. And that very rarely happens to a Wikiverse.
Moderative
[
]
Moderative Transcendent Omni-Gods can further control messages and/or pages compared to Basics. However, they cannot rank any other Transcendent Omni-Gods at all(moderator, any type).
Co-Ultimate
[
]
The Co-Ultimate Transcendent Omni-Gods can do anything on this said wiki except affect Ultimate Transcendent Omni-Gods(founder).
Ultimate
[
]
The Ultimate Transcendent Omni-Gods can do literally anything except do anything beyond the said website, the container of all wikis or toggle a Transcendent Omni-God's ownership of the Co-Ultimate rank. They can erase entire wikis at will(FANDOM Staff and others).
If you're not in here, you can upload your profile picture as a wiki image and add yourself to it through source edit.
