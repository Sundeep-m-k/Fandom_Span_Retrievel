The Chunk of Space is yet another
Ch04s
dimension. It is the least weird
Ch04s
dimension because it’s craziness is only a good 200 on the
Ch04s Chart
. It is red because it has infrared waves that humans can’t see. In the picture, you might see a moon by the chunk of space. This moon is called
The Littler Chunk Of Space
. It’s not a
Ch04s
dimension, though. So, lets talk about the layers now.

Core
[
]
The core is the brightest yellow you could ever imagine and is much like the sun. Take the sun and multiply it by a random number between transfinity and schemafinity. Boom that’s your core.
Mantle
[
]
The mantle is the part with the infrared waves. If you wait long enough you can cook a patty in it.
Barrier
[
]
The barrier has lots of cracks in it because it’s really old. But not older than
Before
. The cracks will all explode transfinity years from now.
Rings

The only thing we know about the rings is that they are tiny rocks made of zeeium.
