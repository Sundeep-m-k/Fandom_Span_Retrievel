The
False Box
is a very rare and unusual type of
Box
. Unlike standard
Boxes
, the False Box is non-recursive, meaning it does not contain itself, nor does it infinitely embed Boxes within itself. Instead, it contains only a some amount of
Outsides
,
Omniverses
,
Barrels
, etc.
Also, False Boxes can evolve to a normal
Box
under certain conditions, which are unknown.
The ratio of False Boxes to normal Boxes is 1:10
100
.
Formation
[
]
False boxes can appear when a cataclysmic event happens to a box that makes it lose its ability to contain itself, and most of the time other properties change too. This can happen because of giant
Sproyongs
, clusters of reality-altering material such as
Toxicium
or
Glitchonicite
or highly concentrated amounts of particles like any Primordium particle or
Thuons
.
