Once he destroyed the Encoder and Friends Wiki, he decided to move on to become a god and to go to this wiki, where his page eventually got deleted at its creators' request. But however he ended up coming back to the wiki because the creator of the page thought it would be funny, and so that's why this page exists. His Encoder and Friends Wiki page
still exists
, and has more information on his backstory.
