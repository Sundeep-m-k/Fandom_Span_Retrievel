Discovery
[
]
The Planet was first discovered by
trans-omniversal explorers
trying to contact outside life. They found The Planet floating between a few iterations of
The Box
. Soon, many different creatures, expeditions, and even entire civilizations were sent to The Planet to investigate this strange planet.
In 15 OYC, the solid rock layer of The Planet was drilled through, revealing
smaller planets inside.
Many of those smaller planets had life. The Planet has never been mined, but the life inside the smaller planets have been contacted before. That is the only way we know about the details of each small planet.
Layers
[
]
The Planet is currently known to have 4 layers, just like many other planets. All of these layers are made of an unknown material that
has proven to defy many laws of physics.
First Layer (Surface)
[
]
The first layer is a solid layer. This layer has absolutely no life on it, and there are also active volcanoes on this layer. They have frequently covered The Planet in a layer of ash and dust before, sometimes completely hiding The Planet from outsiders. There have also been storms on this layer as well, due to the extremely thin atmosphere of The Planet.
Second Layer (Planet Layer)
[
]
The second layer is a mostly empty space that oddly enough
has no gravity
. This layer is where all the smaller planets contained by The Planet reside in. There are also occasional crystalline structures that are anchored onto the underside of the first layer.
Third Layer (Mantle)
[
]
The third layer is a mantle-like layer, and is extremely hot, at over 79 million degrees Kelvin. This layer, due to its scorching temperatures, has no life, but it
is possible for life to survive here
. This layer can occasionally form crystals such as diamond, ruby, emerald, and quartz, but that is very rare.
Fourth Layer (Core)
[
]
The fourth layer, or more commonly known as the Core, is the center of The Planet. G-forces here can reach well over 1000, so exploring and traveling here is very hard and dangerous. A picture of the core has never been taken, so we can only assume what it actually looks like. Research determined that the core is made out of some type of transition metal, such as silver or iron.
Smaller Planets
[
]
There are many small planets in the 2nd layer of The Planet, although really only about 5 are important and noteworthy. Most of these planets are terrestrial, although some can also be gaseous. No liquid planets have been found as of yet. None of the planets have been named yet, so let's just call them with letters and numbers.
Planet A-12
[
]
Planet A-12 is the biggest planet out of all the major planets, and it is also one of the most prosperous. It is approximately 20896 kilometers wide, and it is terrestrial. The life on A-12 has constructed an elaborate

forcefield-like structure around A-12 that prevents A-12 from being bombarded by occasional meteors, asteroids, or sometimes other civilizations on another planet. A-12 usually is quite isolationist, almost always only engaging in trade with one civilization, the civilization on Planet G-13. Still, when The Planet was discovered, Planet A-12 engaged in trade with other civilizations.
A-12 has a flat and slightly hilly terrain.
Planet 57-WD
[
]
Planet 57-WD, aka the Dump, is a planet that is the complete opposite of Planet A-12. Instead of being clean, prosperous, and advanced, 57-WD is a dirty, uncleaned, and primitive planet that all the other planets have dumped their trash on. The life on 57-WD have attempted to destroy the other planets, but all to no avail, since their technology is not strong enough to destroy whole planets. 57-WD is also terrestrial.

57-WD's land is almost 100% toxic waste, and traversing it is is nigh impossible without proper equipment.
Planet 90-X
[
]
Planet 90-X the only gas planet out of the main planets. 90-X is important because it was used by the life on Planet A-12 and G-13 as a stronghold and garrison for troops and resources. 90-X does not have its own life.
90-X also has occasionally glowed from time to time for no apparent reason. The first time it was recorded to have happened was in -268 OYC, and the latest time it was recorded to have happened was in 10928 OYC.

Planet G-13
[
]
Planet G-13 is another advanced civilization in The Planet, with close ties to the civilization on Planet A-12. The major difference is that G-13 is usually more hostile and aggressive towards smaller and less advanced civilizations/life such as the life on 57-WD and HA-8. G-13 has been extremely aggressive towards Planet HA-8 as of the recent attacks by HA-8 on G-13's small and heavily developed planets close to Planet 90-X.
G-13 has pretty flat terrain, allowing for easy and quick travel across it. This is also the

reason why G-13 is one of the most advanced, since building on flat terrain is easier than doing it on rough and jagged land.
HA-8
[
]
Planet HA-8 is one of the more isolated planets, with absolutely no ties to any other major planet. The civilization on HA-8 has had a bitter rivalry with the civilization on G-13 ever since G-13's aggressive attacks on HA-8's major populated cities. HA-8 is quite advanced, but their technology is still less advanced than the technology of Planet A-12 and Planet G-13.

HA-8 has very mountainous and rough terrain, and the civilization inhabiting it have built elaborate tunnels and pathways through the mountains.
