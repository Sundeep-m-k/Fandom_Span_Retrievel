The cube
Behold! the almighty infinite cube. This cube of course has an edge. Its size is infinite, not endless. to explain what that means, imagine an infinite amount and distance of cube came, then after all that infinite cube material comes the edge. The cube has absolutely no purpose beyond being a source of a certain powerful material. The cube may also teleport somewhere else in an attempt to stop people from mining it. However, the cube has now gained some new abilities.
The Material
[
]
The material that is mined from the cube is Kryberion, a crystal like substance that is highly valuable and used in many technologies, mostly used in combat such as making armor plates with them. The Kryberion crystal is near impenetrable, requiring TREEYUM and such to destroy it efficiently. The Kryberion crystals can bend light and generate large amounts of power, however, water can somehow dissolve the Kryberion crystals, melting it down.
The Cube itself
[
]
The Cube can absorb objects that are made of materials less durable than a Kryberion crystal or is made with the crystals, repairing and gaining backk its crystals. The cube has a white ball of energy in its center. When this center is exposed, it will explode destroying both the cube and anything that happens to be too close to it. The cube actively moves and teleports around to prevent getting mined, making getting the Kryberion crystals very hard. The cube can also shoot off some of its crystals to those near.
