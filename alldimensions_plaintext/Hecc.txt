Hecc
is a type of verse with dimensions even smaller than those of a
Heck
. Now, if you have read the former's page, you may know that if a new verse is created that is smaller than it, Hecks will shrink in order to be smaller than said new verse. Well, you may also notice that pages like
the Box
and
Time and Reality
also have measures in place to be the biggest (or, in this case, smallest) verse. They 're not stopping anybody from making things larger, though. The same applies here. Any attempts to make a "smallest/biggest verse" will always be temporary. Logic was thrown out a long time ago.
Hecc is known to travel with Heck when it creates rifts to other verses.
