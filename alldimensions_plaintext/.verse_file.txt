A .verse file is a massive file that contains every
atom
and energy particle as well as their properties. It may resemble Java or C#, but they're actually pretty different.
The only program to open them in a reliable
xD
interactive environment is
Verse.exe
. (Sorry Mac, Linux, Firefox, and Chrome OS users)
