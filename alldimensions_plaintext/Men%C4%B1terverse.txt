The
Menıterverse
, or the Meniterverse, is a verse with a size that is equal to a
p
-adic number, more specifically, the 3-adic number ...1012112220122111. It contains many random shapes and items which can sometimes be exotic. There is natural life, as well as a commonly used research station which studies and holds the things found within the Menıterverse, which currently totals 7,912,833,870,112. It is contained by the

Aggravating 5.3rd Root Calculator
The Aggravating 5.3rd Root Calculator, or just the 5.3rd Root calculator, is a calculator that is only able to give the 5.3rd root of an input as an output. The accuracy of both the input and output is to 3 decimal digits, but 10 integer digits. It is impervious to all damage.
When any creature that is able to see has the 5.3rd Root Calculator in their field of view, they become irrationally angry and begin trying to destroy it. When questioned, they give reasons such as "There's comic sans!

", "The labels of the buttons are misplaced!", and "The entire thing has an uneven shape!"

Connected Pencil and Jar
The Connected Pencil and Jar are a pencil and jar which are both connected with each other. When a piece of carbon is inserted into the jar and it goes through where the inside bottom of the jar would be

, the carbon ends up inside the pencil, with one of two things happening:
If the piece of carbon is small and/or pencil is dull, then the piece of carbon will make the pencil sharper.
If piece of carbon is large and/or the pencil is sharpened, then the piece of carbon will make the pencil longer.
All of the carbon inside of the pencil is graphite. The pencil has the words "ERROR PARSING STRING" and the jar is completely unlabeled.
