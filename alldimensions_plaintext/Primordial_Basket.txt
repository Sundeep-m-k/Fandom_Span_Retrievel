The
Primordial Baskets
are basket-shaped verses that can hold up as many
Primordial Clouds
as possible. If a basket contains too many Primordial Clouds, it breaks and the Primordial Clouds disintegrate into many
Primordiolises
. They are made in
Primordial Factories
and get sent to
Primordial Warehouses
.
Formation
[
]
They're formed with Bambolium, a supersolid that only living things larger than the Primordial Clouds can destroy it.
