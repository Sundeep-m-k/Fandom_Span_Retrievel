A message sent by a
ÿ™
Aboves
are the verses... well,
above
the
Thats
. Aboves are so peaceful that you cannot even say what are they exactly, though of course they arent the largest verses and in fact they're contained by
the bubbles
.
Aboves are actually above (duh) cloud-like things from the outer layer of their local bubble. You can even eat them (especially
ÿ™
s) if you're powerful enough.
Here, you don't need to afraid  of anything but you would still notice they're weird. Why? Because they are
weirdcore verses
!
If you are in an Above (outside of the verses they contain), its very likely you'll suddenly start sleeping and dreaming something good, which can only happen if a ÿ™ sends a message to you that simply says ‚ÄúDream‚Äù.
