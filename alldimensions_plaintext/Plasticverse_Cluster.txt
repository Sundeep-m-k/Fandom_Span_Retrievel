Plasticverses
A
Plasticverse Cluster
is, well, a cluster of
Plasticverses
. These Plasticverses are not bound together in any way, and the Plasticverses inside can easily be separated from the cluster if they are rolled away by a god or advanced machinery, and in a similar way, Plasticverses can be added to the cluster by rolling them to the cluster.
Due to being very easily rollable, it is hard to actually find a Plasticverse Cluster with a lot of Plasticverses, with most of the larger Plasticverse Clusters created purely artificially by rolling together Plasticverses.
Plasticverse Clusters, along with lone Plasticverses, are findable in the
Plastic Factory
.
