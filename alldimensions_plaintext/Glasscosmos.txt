The
Glasscosmos
is made up of
Glassverses
. Due to it being located within
Electrocosmos
, inhabitants get to enjoy tons of light. Unfortunately, this light can sometimes be "too much energy", making life difficult in the Glasscosmos.
Inhabitants have reported seeing "random non-glass planets" appear. They are actually images going into the Lens (Glassverse).
