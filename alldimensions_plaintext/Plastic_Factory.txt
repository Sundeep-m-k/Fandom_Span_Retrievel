A Plastic Factory is a factory of astronomically large size that produces different types of structures in the Plastic Chain, such as
Plasticverses
or
Plasticboxes
. These factories are usually ran by powerful gods and goddesses, under the
Plastic Company
. The factories are estimated to be around 10,000x the size of a
Barrel
. Unlike the structures the factory produces, the factory is set at temperatures of around 45F to 100F, suitable temperatures for humans thanks to heating and cooling when necessary.
