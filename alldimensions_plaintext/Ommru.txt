Ommru
is a huge verse that contains almost everything that could exist in time (but then again, Ommru also exists in time, so
Primordialverse
can also contain it). That is how it contains the
After After
,
----
, and other things that exist, because they all exist in time. But there are always things that don't exist in time, and are just there, like
The Great Cosmic Barrier
. Ommru, at its center, is a collection of
The Coins
working together to try to distribute time evenly across its verses and whatnot, but that sometimes fails, and that is the reason why there are so many verses and voids with no time or very distorted time. Also, it's 'ur mom' backwards without the space and with one of the 'm's in a different place.
