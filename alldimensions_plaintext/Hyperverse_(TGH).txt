Introduction
[
]
The
Generic Hierarchy
's
Hyperverses
are the next "alternative" verse found in the
1st class of TGH
, being the ones after the GH's
Ultraverses
.
Appearance-wise they're pretty similar to the latters, but with a more distorted design. This does NOT mean they're more unstable though, since their stability is mostly high.
Chain
[
]
Unlike the Tultraverses, chains of Hyperverses are actually very big, having about 10
100
verses per Hyperverse, each one being ~5 million times larger than the previous one. The smallest layers are known as MiniHypas and the largest ones are known as OmegaHypas. Most layers inbethween those are just called "Hypa" along with an identification code. Example: Hypa-12T19, Hypa-OD5N6, etc.
Though most layers are stable, in some Hyperverses you can find slighty unstable layers which can end up being destroyed in the worst case scenarios, though instances of this happening are pretty rare.
Why the copied name?
[
]
Even though normal
Ultraverses
are larger than
Hyperverses
, their generic counterparts ignore this and the "cooler" name is given to the larger verse. Im not kidding.
Oh, and also they share some properties with the common Hyperverses, such as being in pretty random places in an
Omniverse
and being extremly filled with
Xenoverses
(this applies to all layers).
