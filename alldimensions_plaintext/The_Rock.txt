A
Rock
is a really big structure that has an INCREDIBLY big dimensionality because it breaks many laws and contains many things. The reason there is so many things in them is because they have barely any blank spaces in them. You won’t find any
voids
in here. All the plants inside a Rock are actually a bunch of
Greenholeverses
. A WHOLE lot of them. Sometimes there are small droplet-sized bits of water on the Rocks, which are no other than infinite collections of
Waterfalls
.
All of the salt you see at the bottom is a bunch of
Lightverses
that are extremely bright. The gray stuff is just the Rocks themselves. If you look closely, you might see some edges. Those are part of a
Vastness
. The edges are made of
Lightnn
, the 300th element. The Rocks are made out of
Grayumm
, the 1649th element. The Rocks aren’t very stable but there is life on them. An extremly advanced species called
the Ultimas
live on ours, in fact.
There is a missconception regarding
Papers
being able to neutralize Rocks, which isnt true since Rocks are way larger and of a higher dimensionality than the formers.
