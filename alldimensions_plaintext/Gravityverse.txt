The Gravityverse is a verse, that strangely enough, has matter with a way stronger gravity than any other matter ever found. This extra gravity has caused stars to collapse faster, matter to fuse faster, and make the entire Gravityverse shrink faster.

Structure
[
]
The Gravityverse, since it is always shrinking due to the immense gravity, has an ever-changing structure. However, the rough placement of things will always stay the same.
Stars
[
]
The Gravityverse does not have many stars. Only 3 types of stars exist in the Gravityverse.
Neutrino Stars
[
]
Somehow, stars with ridiculous amounts of neutrinos exist inside the Gravityverse. These types of stars are usually red, and can give off huge amounts of radiation through solar flares. Since these stars are quite dangerous, much caution is used when getting near one.
"Death" Stars
[
]
There is a type of star in the Gravityverse called a "death" star. These stars glow an extremely bright blue, and can somehow obliterate matter that comes too close. This applies to almost all materials. The exact reason behind this strange phenomenon is still unknown, and research is being conducted to try to find out why. Death stars also are extremely small, at only a few thousand miles across, and many have imploded into themselves before, forming a black hole.
Attraction Stars
[
]
Attraction stars are the rarest stars, and have some of the strongest gravity that has ever been observed in the entire
Box
. These stars can have up to 10x more gravity than even a black hole, and some of these stars have caused catastrophic damage to other stars and the Gravityverse as a whole.
Black Holes
[
]
Many black holes exist in the Gravityverse, due to the immense gravity. Black holes in the Gravityverse can literally swallow the entire Gravityverse up if given enough time, but many measures are put into place to prevent such an event from happening.
Catastrophic events directly involving black holes in the Gravityverse have been prevented by using Attraction Stars before, but this is quite risky;  thus this method is not used very often.
Planets
[
]
Planets inside the Gravityverse aren't very common, but planets have been spotted before, many hosting advanced life. There are only 4 types of planets in the Gravityverse, and none are gaseous.
Terrestrial
[
]
Terrestrial planets are the most common type of planet, and are usually composed of heavier elements, such as iron. This iron has been mined before by native life, but not by a lot, due to fears about the planet collapsing. These planets can collapse the easiest, so much of the life have moved to other, more stable planets or built their own planets.
Artificial
[
]
These planets have been built by the intelligent life forms in the Gravityverse, and are usually the most stable planets. These planets usually have the most life, and many huge cities have been built on these planets. However, since constructing entire planets is very hard, these planets are usually the smallest and the rarest.
Expanding
[
]
These planets are the most chaotic, and somehow have dark energy infused into them. These planets expand very quick, but are very chaotic as the dark energy can rip apart the planet while the gravity of the Gravityverse can squish the planet into a black hole. For this reason, no life exists on any of these planets.
These planets are usually the most short lived ones, and usually break apart after about 1.54 years.
Life
[
]
A common life form inside the Gravityverse is a species resembling spheres. They are very good at resisting extreme gravity, and can traverse the entire Gravityverse very fast. This life, even though they are spherical, can grow limbs at will, and have been seen to phase straight through solid matter.
The plant life in the Gravityverse is sparse, most of it being extremely small. There is, however, a species of fungus that is common, unusually, across the entire verse. The fungus can grow on a massive scale and has been known to cover the entire surfaces of planets.
