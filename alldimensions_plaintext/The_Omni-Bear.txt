Tips
[
]
If you teleport away behind an object, they won’t see you, so you will be safe.
They are very fast, so don’t try to run.
Avoid the claws and the mouth. Those are the deadly parts
Omni-Bears might start chasing omni-bats, so it’s a good idea to find a few of those.
Omni-Bears are so large that going through tight holes makes it impossible for them to get to you.
Do not fight an Omni-Bear unless you carry an Omni-Gun, and even then the Omni-Bear is still not a good option to fight.
