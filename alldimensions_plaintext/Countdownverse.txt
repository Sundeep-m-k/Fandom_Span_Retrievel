The
Countdownverse
is a very famous verse for being the first artificial verse ever created. It was created after a countdown trillions of years ago that was said loudly using voice changers, and over ten billion living things watched it happen. The countdown was so popular, there were multiple things from other multiverses that watched the event. This countdown, being so popular, named the verse, and started from 1000 for dramatic effect, making it even more suspenseful and popular. When the countdown reached zero, a 10,000 ly verse appeared. It was made by crushing many resources into a small space, and then bringing them out would create a verse.
