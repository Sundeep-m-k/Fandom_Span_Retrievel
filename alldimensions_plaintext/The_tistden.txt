The
tistden
, also known as the
Inverse dentist
, is considered the exact opposite of
The dentist
. The reason because there is such a huge gap between this and
Cceh
and this is because an accident in the construction of
Oakverse
spawned in, removed, and scrambled all the verses, leading the Tistden being exiled into 7th-class, all of the
negative size
verses being redirected to the
hierarchy loop point
(except for the
Verseuni
since
Scalene
was displeased), and all of the 7th-class verses being spawned in.
It is extremely unstable, and is more unstable than any texa, kentoverse, or ring, ejecting 1ø
Peoplakanias
per yoctosecond. Much like
Hentexa
, it appears as a void, but using a device that makes verse look larger, you can see what is in the picture.
