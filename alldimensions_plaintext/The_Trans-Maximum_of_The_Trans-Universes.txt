The
Trans-Maximum of the Trans-Universes
(TMTU) is the last Trans-Universe and should NOT be taken for granted.
These verses are literally so far in the Index of Canon Verses that the only way to get here is to break into non existent reality and then teleport up to these verses using
Glitchoni-transcendiate
(
Gl

Ts

{\displaystyle \ce{Gl209Ts55}}
). Plus, the only way to even survive a
VOIDSECOND
in these verses outside of their
AHHHH!!!!!!!!!s
is to wear a very large and thick oxygen pack and a titanium astronaut suit (as the gravity would crush you and there is no way to have a small oxygen pack and survive since the gravity would rip through the oxygen pack, and you know there is no oxygen).
You will also notice the TMTUs look identical to the
Glitch Core
, as nothing can form here except Glitchonicite and
Transcendium
, which the Glitch Core is also made out of. Almost nothing is known about TMTUs, which is why we have only one fact about it, which is that the picture on the right is not the verse itself, but the entities that lives in them... In temperature, is veeeery cold, being lower than absolute zero, and a lot more.
CREATOR'S NOTE: Edit this page as much as you like. Certainly add facts to it, because the page is kind of boring without them.
