The
Reallydenseverse
is a small cube that contains many everyday objects such as rubber ducks, rubik's cubes, couches, chairs, bicycles, houses, soup cans, water bottles, etc. This verse is somehow so dense it is 41x as massive as the
Universe
whilst being only 40x40x40 cm in size. It is unknown why this is not a black hole and remains to be a regular object.
