Microdimensions
is a spatial kind of dimensions that can be found in any
Realm
, which goes below spacetime.
This kind seems to be absolutely boundless, as it contains infinite Microdimensions without boundaries. The topology is always Euclidean, as settled by Distorsion. (See
Dimensional Blueprint Particles
) The system of
existence ranks
is really basic in Microdimensions, as only
existence
and
non-existence
objects can handle.
All Microdimensions build up to form
Chaos Fabric
, a infinite-capacity blueprint for every single object in spacetime. Everything in all Chaos Fabrics is made of 4 ultimate building blocks:
·
,
○
,
⬤
, and
Blueprint Particles
. Only Blueprint Particles are required to construct the entire
Realm
, while
Uqreak fibers
build objects in that Realm by indirectly jumping from Microdimensions to spacetime.
Subexistons
could exist, but particles that assign existence ranks can't be contained.
There is a rumor that they were coded by
the Suprematism
from
Subrealities
, before our reality begins with a single ⬤.
