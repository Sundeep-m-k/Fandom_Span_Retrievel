The
Aztecverse
is a verse that contains one Hyperverse.
Only a handful of Hyperverses have their own Aztecverse superior to them. Those which do are usually of higher importance, and their Aztecverse acts like a beacon.
The Aztecverse is made out a material which has similiar properties to glass, but is much more refractive or light-like particles or rays. As this material is not solid, creatures can glide through it with ease.
In the geometric center of te Aztecverse is the Hyperverse, with above, below, left, right, infront and behind having large holes able to fit the Hyperverse and other structures through.
