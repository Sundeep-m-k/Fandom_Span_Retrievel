The Glory of Everything
"An Infium is an abstract, paradoxical entity that embodies the amalgamation of all things, all categories, all characters, all concepts, and even the notions of "other," "beyond," and "etcetera." It defies classification because it is every classification simultaneously, object and idea, identity and environment, self and multitude. An Infium is not just everything, it is the concept of everything-ness itself, encompassing contradictions, opposites, undefined terms, impossible states, and even what lies beyond comprehension. Where most things are something, an Infium is all somethings and all nothings at once."
Think of something with a infinite amount of infiums, now make this thing have a infinite amount of duplicates and put all of them in a
Ehaz
that was shrinked to a extremely small size and put a tranfinite amount of fractals of these ehazs and do that over and over again until you got a boxal, do the process for a boxal again but even longer and more packed and you got a super boxal, do this so many times until you got a unboxal, do that so many times and you got a negative infinitesimally 0% of the Allcube, you can repeat this process as much as you want but you will never reach even a actual infinitesimal of the Allcube, it's beyond impossibilities, and if beings can exist without a cause, the rules of reality may be breaking, but that's not the case for the Allcube it's reality beyond
reality
, Logic breaks down at it's smallest layer, mathematics fades out of existence at the second smallest layer and all other concepts cease at the third smallest layer, The Allcube was even Before
Nihilum
, The Allcube says it all, It's a unreachable finality that never ceases.
