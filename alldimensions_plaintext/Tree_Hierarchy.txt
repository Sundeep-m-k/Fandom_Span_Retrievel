Introduction

"I was gonna add a tree image here, but I saved 2 of them and they were both illegal file types." -
BNR
Welcome to the Tree Hierarchy! A hierarchy where it lists every verse in a tree. This page will be MASSIVE.
Rules
[
]
We'll start off with the
Protoverse
, and we'll list every verse. IF we reach a verse contained by multiple verses not covered yet, we'll list both of those verses up until the verses are in the same verse.
Example
[
]
If Verse A was in Verse B but could also be in Verse C which is in Verse B, we'd list the following:
Verse A
Up From Verse C
[
]
Verse C
Verse B
Up From Verse B
[
]
Verse B
If a verse contains a new verse not covered yet, we'll travel down the hierarchy starting from those new verses.
Example
[
]
If we start off from Verse A and move to Verse B, but Verse C is also in Verse B, we'd list the following:
Verse A
Verse B
Down From Verse C
[
]
Verse C
The verses listed also have to be verses. We can include stuff like
Universe
and
Multiverse
because they're verses, but we can't include stuff like
'thingy'
and
The Weird Laughaguaghee
because they aren't verses.
