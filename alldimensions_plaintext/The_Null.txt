Introduction
[
]
The
Null
is a
void
that is contained by the
Metareality-Web
. The name of the void is contradictory, since the Null is actually huge, instead of being tiny.
No
creatures
besides
gods
have entered this void, but the Null is thought to be infinitely cold, since there is no heat or light source in it.
The Null has an entrance that acts like an enormous
black hole
. It sucks in everything that is too close to it, and if some unsuspecting creature gets sucked inside, it will get violently ripped apart by the gravity. That is why no "weak" or "normal" creature has ever been inside the Null alive.
A few facts
[
]
The Null is one of the biggest voids ever discovered. The only way we know this is by seeing how light spreads out inside its entrance. You have to wait super long and do this with extremely powerful equipment, so this method has only been tried once, and without much success.
The Null is also extremely empty. It is so empty that if you survive going through the entrance, you will get erased when you enter, since the level of "reality" is so low. The low level of reality erases you from existence. This is not as bad as somehow getting out of any Metareality-Web though, because here you only get erased on one timeline.
This void spreads out infinitely in every direction. The same method of using light to find out how big the Null was is also used to find out if it had any boundaries. Apparently, it didn't have any.
The Null used to be a flourishing reality, but some unknown power caused its
Information Bubble
to split off and make it the weird empty void that it is now.
