3D depiction of the Primordial Box.
This place is devoid of entities, but we don't know how but people who venture here went missing. Therefore, it's recommended for you to stay back home.
We don't know its shape or temperature, as it is just pitch dark, and the people who went there never lived to tell anything. The robots, the Nobezian outside-universe investigators, and the interspace police were sent to measure its temperature but it disappeared and could send the measurement results back.
