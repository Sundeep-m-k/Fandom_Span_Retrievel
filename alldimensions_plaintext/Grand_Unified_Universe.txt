The Grand Unified Universe is an extremely unstable universe, that has not yet achieved total division of the fundamental forces, where it seemed that the Grand Unification Epoch of said universe, has frozen in time, hence:
Grand Unified Universe.
Here, normal matter (i.e ours) is impossible, but different forms of physics and laws apply here. The Grand Unified Universe is also extremely warm, but not as hot as the planck temperature.
