Milion
is an extremely unnoticed particle that exists. The reason why its considered as unnoticed is because it's shape is actually quite dark compared to other particles.
They look like Bubbles and act similar to them since their edges are very weak. Luckily, unlike other particles of their size, we actually know their dimensionality. They're four-dimensional objects, which means that they can do things a third-dimensional creature cant. They contains Unedions, but strangely, they are more of them outside than inside of them. They're also Nonat Particles, which means that they have absolutely no traits.
Milions also have layers, which are:

High Aura Layer
[

A Milion's Aura layer is a Green Aura-like material that is most common at it's axis's. As it protrudes from it. Particles like Unedion's are quite common here which is why there are more Unedions on the inside than outside. It also has a Blue cloud at the top of the layer. Which is the most unstable part of it. As it contains many

Low Aura Layer
[

The Low Aura Layer is the layer of where the Milion get's it's Defense From. The Defense it like a Rainbow Colored shield that protects it from oncoming objects. Like Rouge Objects. It also contains some Unedions too. It also contains Milium, Milion's element.
Outer Barrier Layer
[
]
The Outer Barrier Layer is a layer that is basically the shell of the Milion. As it contains most of the materials in the Milion.
Inner Barrier Layer
[
]
The Inner Barrier Layer is the exact same as the Outer Barrier Layer. So there is not much to say here except that it looks like Silk.
Insides
[
]
The Insides of a Milion are absolutely nothing, other than some Unedions.

Milions are extremely small particles that exists and that their dimension is known. They contain many
Unedions
and are contained by
Metiums
.
