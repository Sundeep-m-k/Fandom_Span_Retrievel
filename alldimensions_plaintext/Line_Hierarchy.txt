The
line hierarchy
is an odd system of progressively larger
lines
containing smaller ones. There are far too many of them for a proper count of their amount, and the whole thing is a mess, but to explain it somewhat simply...
Description
[
]
The first line is a green one. It is contained by a line that is only 1 hexadecimal character different from the green line. It is contained by the same thing, and it goes on until it loops back to green.
It then starts over, but there is a black strip in this new line that is
2
−
24
{\displaystyle 2^{-24}}
of the width of the line. Every time the cycle repeats, the strips gets thicker.
Repeat the cycle until the black strip makes up the whole line. Then the strip that took over the line changes color by 1 hexadecimal digit, and repeat until it loops.
Then, the 1/(NoHCP)th top of the line gains a white strip, changes one hexadecimal digit every cycle. This does end, however, as the white top loops fully, the last layer of hexadecimal line madness comes to an end with a green strip appearing on the white line and doing the same as the black strip.
