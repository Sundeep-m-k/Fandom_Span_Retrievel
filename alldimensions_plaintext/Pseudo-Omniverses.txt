The creation of
Pseudo-Omniverses
is described in some detail on the
Omniverse
page.
Pseudo-Omniverses are verses that are created by Omniverses during the collision / destruction of the laters or via being slowly formed in their local
Allomniverse
. 11 Pseudo-Omniverses exist in our Allomniverse. Most Pseudo-Omniverses arent finality-based, or even subfinality-based. In fact, a very small portion of the properties they hold are shared inbetween them all, or even inbetween any two pairings. This is because of the sheer strength of the collisions, causing sub-dimensional disturbances on even a 0-dimensional point, that being the location of the collision, to completly alter the resulting verse.
The 7th - 11th Pseudo-Omniverses of our Allomniverse all share the same dimensionality and existence rank, with their sizes being relatively equal, as they're all fragments of the same primordial Pseudo-Omniverse which broke apart during its creation. The original Pseudo-Omniverse, containing all of the fragments and more, is called the Berryverse.
The Pseudo-Omniverses
[
]
There are countless variations of pseudo-omniverses with bizarre properties of their own. General physics are bent and altered to high level, allowing rather anomalous sceneries for mere error verses. Below are fraction of those pseudo-omniverses, and they are most common types of them.

"The largest of the verses, the most inhabited Pseudo-Omniverse, and a giant disco ball..."
SPT-PRIME is most massive pseudo-omniverse with shape of fragmented
s
e
pt
agonal
prime
polytope, and is the biggest pseudo-omniverse. Because SPT-PRIME pseudo-omniverses are only kinds of them which directly seperates from its parent omniverse, they generally have stable physics controlled in the domain of sanity. Also, these are only pseudo-omniverse with size of infinity. Along with its alternate counterparts, SPT-PRIME decorates parent omniverse with colorful spectrums.
Overall info / "Beauty of symmetry and chaos"
[
]
Ever heard of Meiosis, a process very similar to how SPT-PRIME seperates from parent omniverse? No? ok anyways. When SPT-PRIMEs first seperate from their parent omniverse (basically the moment it forms), large amount of energy flows into SPT-PRIMEs. The powerful, primordial energy gets dense, while the space cools down and physics laws stop mixing and altering. But even if omniverse finishes building its rules, SPT-PRIMEs are still contracting and their inner energy goes on for a little bit longer. The product is similar but not identical physics laws compared to parent omniverse. Types of SPT-PRIMEs' laws vary a lot by what was happening at the moment of creation.
WIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPP! :DD
Most SPT-PRIMEs have a tiny ordered patterns, sort of crystallized portion of space where creation of physics laws went on longer than other places. Because physics laws have time to arrange themselves into complex patterns, usually, regions with fractals or any ordered patterns have complex laws and are like tiny verses themselves.
WIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPP! :DD
Influential effect / "Replicator"
[
]
Like how inner orders form from "crystallization" of some space inside SPT-PRIMEs, regions near them follow the same event. As SPT-PRIMEs radiate their primordial energy painfully slowly, space around them slowly change. Laws and orders start to appear, mostly in form of septagonal symmetry with SPT-PRIME being the axis of symmetry. Anything entering one side of imaginary septagon, will be replicated its existence in all the other sides of it. Sometimes, it can get really complicated with septagonal polyhedrons and polytopes reflecting existences in many dimensions.

"Nobody knows in what orbit a giant, beautiful, hexagonal fractal verse will be, except itself..."
The
snowflake
and its cousin pseudo-omniverses are symmetrical fractal verses with huge chain of verses going down to insane depth. A pretty impressive feature, considering the verse is finite-sized. This unique feature is granted by omniverse's physics mixing with snowflake thanks to weird orbits. In fact, the orbits of snowflake is quantum mechanical
[

, meaning its position and speed cannot be measured at same time. So its orbit crosses every possible location around  omniverse, even INSIDE it as long as its position is not measured by thinking being.
Overall info / "Extend from zero to infinity"
[

Upon the explosion that creates omniverse, bunch of finite verses gets flung out of omniverse. Their internal heat is roaming wild, and like what happens to SPT-PRIME, their insides are completely messed up at first while the order takes over. The energy of omniverse's birth is hilariously large, and energy held within tiny verses cannot get free. Many of them explodes into dust cloud, but some uses the energy as advantage.
By preserving the heat as long as they can, rules get more and more complex over time. Eventually, energy at bigger scale fades out. However, in smaller scales, energy is still creating much more complex physics every moment. The process of intense energy fleeing to tinier scale and creating complexity repeats over and over. It eventually settles, at the point where infinite complexity and
nestation
numbers are reached. Ultimately, the result is very weird because complexity rises rather than decreasing.
WIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPP! :DD
Pattern of energy flowing down generates all sorts of worlds, but almost all snowflake verses have at least one uniform rule over certain scale or range. The situation is caused by general process of complex physics' formation being approximately same among snowflake verses. Uniform rules often have lots of variations, alternating slightly by exactly what interruption has been applied on them.
WIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPP! :DD
Influential effect / "The omniversal fractal"
[

The crackles of primordial heat that creates snowflake verses, spreads throughout nearby spaces similar to
sparks traveling inside steel wool
. Though not as complex as slowflake itself, the place where its influential region affects also gets influenced by its primordial energy. Minimum to maximum orders are found from end to center of snowflake influential region, and the result is weird nestations of verses and realms seemingly making no sense.

"Physics collapsing into its heart, the verse is at the Border of Life and Death..."
The borders of
P
seudo

mniverse
Neph
and similar verses are extremely unstable. Its irregular attraction from center grabs various points of border, and crunch into verse's center. But the border does not "bend" without influencing anything; it drags space along with it in process of collapsing and rebounding. The center region destroys sense, since bending of space sometimes scales even high-level archverses into size below universe, or literally to size of nokia phone.
Overall info / "All holes lead to core"

First, the border of P-O-Neph does not resemble any of verses; certain places of border are all being drawn into center, creating sort of urchin-shaped verse. At "spike" parts, there are none to very few verses or even objects. Instead, at the verse's center, verses are so tightly packed together that attraction they create grabs collapsed corners of border and never lets go.
WIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPP! :DD
Influential effect / "White hole?"

From unstable spots of P-O-Neph's border, occasionally, huge amount of overloaded verse explode out of it. The damage quickly repairs, but cloud of verses and objects have already weakened attraction. P-O-Neph slightly rebounds its boundary to original position, intensely dragging space with it. However, P-O-Neph does not cancel out inertia upon event of rebounding, speeding some verses to crazy speed.
Those verses can shatter P-O-Neph's border and get out of it. This slowly disintegrates whole pseudo-omniverse, leading to its ultimate demise. While getting disassembled by itself, P-O-Neph releases intense glow altering everything near it.

Overall info / "Mystery sanctuary of verse formation"
[
]
One unique factor of P-O-sin whatever is rather strange one; it's all blank space inside it. Instead, the border of this pseudo-omniverse is doing all the work at making the verse useful. P-O-sin((4*pi)/45)'s border is entirely made of swirling energy and excited space, and they produce all sorts of particle fabrics and fibers with lots and lots of protoverses in them. So the material is not exactly one kind, but more like amalgamation of various networks capable of collapsing and producing verses.

At the region where space kind of breaks (small scale of space is easily breakable while big scale ones are EXTREMELY hard to break), few normally ridiculous concepts become new standard. Especially hard-hit one is law of energy conservation (at big scale). P-O-sin((4*pi)/45)s all straight slap Newton in the face. It adds extra energy to entire network of system, and they tend to explode into beautiful firework in the process of doing so.

dimensional" is a blinding black hole (sort of) orbiting basically right above omniverse border. There is at least one ROD-3 orbiting any specific omniverse, and it emits powerful energy geysers from its "event horizon". When geyser hits omniverse border, it seperates the border into countless dimensions and deforms it. Gravitational attraction of it also does same thing, but much weaker. The deformation ability of ROD-3 is useful for omniverse because omniverse emits overcrowded energy using the spot where ROD-3 is affecting.
Overall info / "Advanced power confinement tech"
[
]
ROD-3 is not exactly a black hole, but rather a verse with objects awkwardly fat for pseudo-omniverse. The objects create strong attraction field bending and disassembling objects into their individual dimensions. And the reason why ROD-3 is not a black hole even though it performs worse action than black hole with its power, is because ROD-3 lets light escape.

PDK-17500
is an unstable fragment. It and its countless variations build up enormous, gravitationally-bound swarms orbiting the omniverse in large numbers. Individual fragments cannot do anything except floating mindlessly and gradually fading away to explosion. But with friends, the story is whole lot different. Their physics clang and cancel bad ones out (the process works similarly to natural selection), and they becomes basically immune at fading death.

"The smallest of the verses and the smallest fragment of the Omniverse, and inter-versal radar dish..."
Pulsars
are degenerate fragments of formal pseudo-omniverses. They form largely upon the birth of omniverse, when all sorts of verses are crushing together and bunch of them shatter and collapse. Other ones form from later verse destruction. As the name "pulsar" tells, it is extremely dense, luminous, and tiny. If any smaller, it would collapse and explode.
