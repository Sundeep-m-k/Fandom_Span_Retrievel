A neutrino is a very small object, or an elementary particle, around 10
-25
meters in size. Neutrinos are split into three different types: muon neutrinos, tau neutrinos, and electron neutrinos. Each type also has an antimatter opposite.

Overview
[
]
A neutrino (v) is a fermion that only interacts via weak interaction and gravity. Weak interactions create three different leptonic flavors of neutrino: muon neutrinos (v
u
), tau neutrinos (v
t
), and electron neutrinos (v
e
). A neutrino's mass (< 2.14 × 10
−37
kg) is so small that it was once thought to be zero. Neutrinos are created via radioactive decay, such as: beta decay of atomic nuclei, or via supernova. For each neutrino there is also an antineutrino. The first detection of the neutrino was in 1956.
