About
[
]
The
Server Rooms
are, like their names indicate, rooms which are responsible of containing server which contain
Here are your solar systems. Now leave.
.
How?
[
]
To host such a big type of
verse
, the CPU and GPU within the Server Rooms must be extremely powerful, so they naturally put in very powerful RAM, CPU, and GPU by themselves. The parts are so powerful, that these verses never lag and their contents of hold everything inside the HAYSSNLs down to their deepest nestation (a singular
Blueprint Particle
).
Local entities
[
]
There are a few robot-like
entities
in the Server Rooms at all times. They open the casing to clean cosmic dust then close it. Yep, that's literally all they do. The parts are powerful enough to run anything inside of an
Alphasm
's imagination {although the bigger they are, the more lag is caused by them}.
Containment
[
]
Server Rooms are contained inside of
Epic NGLverses
. The combined overheating of the Server Rooms produce small deposits of the
Divine Broth
Epic NGL
, which when combined with
Monster power
and the other 19
Divine Broths
allow for mass production, destruction and cloning of all verses in the
Official
Hierarchy
.
That's all there is to say.
