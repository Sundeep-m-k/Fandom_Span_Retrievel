The Pencil Sayings are a series of phrases/sentences used by the
Transcendent Omni-God
named
ICantEdit
. These phrases should not be used by any creature from within the wiki due to their sacredness.
"I Need Ideas"

]
"I need ideas" in
The Pencil Language
This is the phrase that ICantEdit uses when he is low on ideas for things to create on the AD wiki. ICantEdit will usually be in severe distress if he keeps repeating this phrase again. This phrase is used by ICantEdit a lot, as he wants to always fulfill his goal of at least 1 page per 2 days. This phrase has been used so much as for ICantEdit to even make pages such as
No Ideas
and
I Don't Have Any Ideas
, which are representations of what he is feeling when he is constantly repeating this message and trying to come up with a page idea.
"Should I move my pages to my wiki"
[

"Should I move my pages to my wiki in
The Pencil Language
This phrase is one of the relatively new phrases. ICantEdit uses this phrase when he is facing the dilemma of moving his AD pages over to his cosmology wiki, ICantEdit's Cosmology Wiki. Just like the previous phrase, ICantEdit will be in distress if saying this over and over again, as to go so far to say gibberish on the AD Discord server. So far, ICantEdit has moved a few of his pages on AD over to his wiki due to his wiki, although his wiki has no activity. This makes ICantEdit extremely unmotivated to continue editing it.
"help me [insert random gibberish here]"
[
]
"help me [gibberish]" in
The Pencil Language
This is a phrase which is used by ICantEdit a lot, especially after his repeated blabbering of "I Need Ideas" or "Should I move my pages to my wiki". This phrase is used as his distress signal. The random gibberish at the end is him trying to cope with the absolute magnitude of his situation, since having no ideas and being faced by the choice of moving all your pages to your wiki is enough to drive a pencil insane.
