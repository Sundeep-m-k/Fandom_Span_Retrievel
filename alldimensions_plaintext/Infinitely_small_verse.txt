(Now this isn't an end-all-be-all article) This universe is a large white vortex leading to unknown things. This universe has a ring surrounding it that can kill do to how cold it is around it. So basically, the ring which is the faint area around smallverse is -234 to the 734 power degrees, the closer you get to the middle the hotter it is the middle being 554 Quintilian degrees.
The Ring
The ring is a faint area surrounding the vortex it is mostly made up of nitrogen and
ejected particles
. the ring does not move it stays still, since the ring is -234 to the 734 power degrees it can freeze any spaceships coming within 4 light years of the ring.
The vortex could lead to several locations such as the
Lone world
and the
Darkest Reach
or the
Corrupted Fractaverse
its highly unlikely that anything will happen due to it being able to kill anything that comes within 4 light years of it.
Infinitely small verses can be found inside of the stellaverses due to them being so rare they are incredibly hard to find without using portals.
