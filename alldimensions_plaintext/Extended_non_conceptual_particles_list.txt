Like the article's name says, this is a list designated for all the non conceptual particles below a
Yarron
. The structures mentioned at the bottom of the page are the smallest ones and vice versa.
Xerrons
Fristons
Nullons
Negatons
Smallestons
Xerrons are the sub-yarron particles that are the closest to them size and containment wise. They're fundamental building blocks of the aforementioned particles, being the ones that make them "work" via making them spin and producing the energy-like substance, as Xerrons ARE this kind of energy itself (thats why they glow too), and even when they are expulsed from their yarron they regenerate quickly. Their size is roughly 1/600 billionth of a yarron.
Xerrons
Fristons are sub-xerron particles, being 1/∞th their size. They can multiply easily out of nowhere, explaining why xerrons can be replaced so quickly even after being expulsed by their local yarron. Sometimes rogue fristons are found in
non conceptual verses
instead of xerrons, adding a bit more of density to them.
Fristons
Nullons are roughly 0/1th the size of a friston. They're the ones responsible of giving the orders to their local friston in so they can multiply. This helps making the fristons unable to multiply more than needed, but sometimes nullons can stop working properly which can cause xerrons becoming either extremly dense or extremly big due to the increased amount of fristons, that in the worst case scenario can even put their local yarron in danger.
Nullons
Negatons are 1/33th the size of a nullon, and their purpose is to analyze the environment so that the nullons know when to give their fristons the order to start or stop multiplying depending on the scenario. Negatons failing is the reason nullons can sometimes stop working.
Negatons
Smallestons are the smallest non conceptual particles, that being the reason of their given name. They're 1/Ωth the size of a negaton and are considerably unstable, being the reason both negatons and nullons can fail, though most of the time their unstableness only affects the smallestons themselves and not the higher structures.
