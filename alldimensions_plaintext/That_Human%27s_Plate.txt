Location
Contained by

Contains
The Fried Egg
, occasionally a few

Neighbors
That Human
on occasion
That Human's Plate
is a plate used by
That Human
which holds
Fried Eggs
for That Human to eat.
Although it is insanely large, it is still very weak in comparison to
The Pan
and the rest of
The Other Room
. It usually has 2-3
Fried Eggs
on it at any one time, extremely rarely 4 Fried Eggs if That Human is very hungry
[

]
. This has very little going for it, as it is made of the same omega porcelain as
The Bowl
and is constantly raided by
The Ants
. It has a napkin and fork next to it at all times, unless
That Human
is eating a Fried Egg. That Human's Plate is switched out every megaweek to be washed, while another Plate takes its place. Unwashed plates go in The Sink.
While not as extreme, That Human's Plate can be very hot for multiple megadays when introduced to a fresh Fried Egg, as it holds heat somewhat well. When it is cooled, The Ants are almost always all over it unless they notice That Human, in which case they run. This very large omega porcelain plate holds a very small amount of cracks where the heat is much lower. There are occasionally bits of Fired Egg in here which make these cracks some of the safest places in the RGB Box.
