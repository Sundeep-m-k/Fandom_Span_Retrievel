("

Threes
, and are the most dense out of all the verses in the
One Chain
.
Appearance
[
]
Fours appear to be very bright stars that glow blue and white. They're unlike all the other verses in the One Chain because they look extremely bright instead of completely black.
However, Fours look just as dark as all the other verses in the One Chain when viewed from inside.
Structure
[
]
Fours contain exactly 4
Threes
inside them, thus containing 4! (24)
Ones
. Between each Three is a ridiculously sticky and slightly pink substance. This substance is very hard to traverse, and stops all the Threes from bouncing everywhere.
However, if a Three glitches through reality, it can avoid the substance and still move freely, since it is in a different existence state.
An entity that lives in some Fours.
