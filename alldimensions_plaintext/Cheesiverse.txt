Cheeseverses
The Cheesiverse is one of the largest
cheeseverses
. It contains all cheese to have ever existed in our local
omniverse,
and as more cheese is produced, the cheesiverse grows. It also contains rare types of cheese that are not found in our omniverse.

Shape and exterior
[
]
The Cheesiverse is a large sphere with an exterior made out of a composite cheese that is made of all types of cheese contained within it. this exterior is hardened to the point where nothing in our omniverse can destroy or even damage it, and travelling to the Cheesiverse requires teleportation or rifts. The exterior also regenerates infinitely fast.
Atmosphere (or cheesosphere)
[
]
The atmosphere of the Cheesiverse is made of cheese gas. It gets thicker the more you go down, and is the thickest at the surface. Cheese gas is comprised of various cheeses in a gas state, and can be toxic, although cheese-based lifeforms are able to inhale it.
Surface
[
]
The surface of the Cheesiverse is an endlessly growing ball of cheese. Cheese constantly rains onto the surface in the form of either full solid cheeses, liquid cheese, or cheese rain. The terrain on the surface is extremely hard to traverse without a Cheesiverse Exploration Vehicle (CEV), which is suited specifically to travel in the Cheesiverse. Areas that get more precipitation than others are usually more elevated than others.
Cheese rain
[
]
Cheese rain is just a liquid cheese that is made of the same composite the exterior is made of, but soft. Once it hits the surface it becomes solid. Precipitation is completely random.
Subsurface
[
]
The subsurface of the Cheesiverse is comprised of slowly hardening/softening cheese. This cheese forms the substrate for which cheese life can grow on. There are caverns that go into the subsurface layer. Different types of cheese harden and soften differently, and certain types of cheese become better over time. As a result of this, there are often cheese mining operations made with the sole purpose of harvesting these rare cheeses that age like wine.
Cheese mining is banned.
