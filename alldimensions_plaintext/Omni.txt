The endless hierarchy of
On
forever stretches beyond any -verse, besides
The Box
. Dark spheres of madness, and havens of order, grow ever larger in a void of possibility. This is considered to be 'everything' in On, although there is always more.
This concept, brought by the priests of
Lord On
to the -verses, teaches of a dimension so limitless, growing numbers of what we consider to be 'everything' do not define it. There are always greater numbers of maddening infinities, while 'everythings' swirl around
Lord On
. He casually devours one, and begins to dream. Somewhere in the darkness between dimensions, the inhabitants of such verses are resurrected in service of him.
