The
Palladiumverse
is a universe that has 0.8% palladium. The palladium is mostly concentrated in the crusts of planets, but also exists in nebulae and asteroids. The Palladiumverse is not very different from our Universe, as it has the same laws of physics.

Origins
[
]
The Palladiumverse was formed when two verses collided with each other 16.2 billion years ago, which were the
Ferroverse
and the
Alatarverse
. The Alatarverse didn't have the same laws of physics as the Palladiumverse, but the Ferroverse had almost the same laws of physics, but that's not the reason the Palladiumverse has almost the same laws. That is actually due to the fact that when two verses collide, the resulting verse has random laws of physics. In this case, the result just so happened to have nearly the same laws as the Ferroverse. Either way, the Palladiumverse was formed by that collision.
Civilizations
[
]
Palzaxia
[
]
The
Palzaxia
are the civilization in this universe with the highest Kardashev Scale. They have a Kardashev Scale of 3.63, and have conquered 700 galaxies. They created a really strong material, called Palladite, or Palladium Diosmite (PdOs
2
). It is used in tall buildings and in drills.
Meptzzyo
[
]
The
Meptzzyo
are a civilization with a kardashev scale of 2.84, but they invented the Vaccum Decay and
CSE
protection technology that protects the entirety of the Meptzzyo's home galaxy.
