About
[
]
A
solar system
, also known as a
star system
, consists of one or more
stars
and
planets
orbiting a common barycentre. All objects included in a solar system are all held together with gravity, and the main source of gravity is the star. Technically, the term refers to the star around which Earth orbits (the Sun, which is called
Sol
), but either "solar system" or the more general term "star system" can be used to refer to any planet-star pair. They are found within
stellar bubbles
. There are 150 billion+ solar systems in the
Milky Way
.

Our Solar System. (open the image in a new tab in order to see it full).
The Sun and its planets.
Our Solar System ends in the Oort Cloud, because that;s where the Sun's gravitational pull can reach. Here, we see the Oort Cloud, beyond the planets and beyond the Kuiper Belt.
