About
[
]
The
FATALverses
are the largest type of
verses
in the
ERRORverses chain
. They're so
glitchy
, they'll get complete fatalness if their borders get touched. Because to this, they're also one of the least stable objects in the aforementioned
chain
. It's also the reason this type of verse received its name.
These verses have extremely strong concentration of
Glitchonicite
, so when something touches them, they'll be instantly corrupted to death. The same would apply to a verse, but instead they'd collapse on contact with the
element
.
These verses can also give major glitches to their local
Fake Pageverses
, that in the worst cases can completely destroy them.
FATALverse uncorruption
[
]
The
FATALverse uncorruption
, also known as the
destruction of FATALverses
is an event that  happens when the amount of
FAILverses
gets too low, they somehow get uncorrupted or start colliding with eachother in mass. All of these make the corruption of their local FATALverse go down, hence the name.
This can even affect their local Fake Pageverse if too many FATALverses are uncorrupted, which can lead to those Fake Pageverses either becoming safer or making them self-destruct (if the uncorruption is too sudden).
When this event happens, extremely strong Glitchonicites will lose their strength, while smaller ERRORverse chain verses inside of the uncorrupted FATALverse get weakened too and turned into roughly the size of a
Teraverse
, which makes them collapse into
black holes
. This means an uncorrupted FATALverse usually contains either black holes or nothing at all.
