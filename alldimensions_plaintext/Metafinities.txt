When your verse is just too large, you need something beyond infinities. Ω, ∞, ω, they’ve all become… too small. And you can’t multiply them, that just results in themselves. So, Metafinities are numbers describing the sizes of verses in Meta-Class 4 or above.

Power of Infinities (POI)
[
]
Not to be confused with ‘Powers of Infinity’, which as we know, just results in infinity, Power of Infinity is the ‘power’ an infinity has. How much bigger. This can’t be quantified, but we can operate on it. We do this with Ω
IP
. We can’t have Ω
IP+
, as IP  cannot be quantified. So, we create Ω
IP×
. Ω
IP×
1 is just Ω. It is 1x the ‘power’ of Ω. Ω
IP×
2 is Ω, with double the power. At the surface level, Ω
IP×
2 is basically Ω… to Ω.
Like Ω, if Ω was 0 or something
(not actually, as that would still result in Ω). Ω
IP×
3 is 3 times the power. So Ω
IP×
∞ is INFINITE times the power. So, is Ω
IP×
Ω would just be Ω
IP↑
2 right? Why that’s exactly WRONG! It don’t work like that. Ω
IP↑
2 is even larger than Ω
IP×
Ω
IP×
Ω
IP×
Ω… forever! Just like how Ω×Ω won’t give you a larger number. Nay, Ω
IP↑
2 is basically, completely surpassing Ω
IP×
! So, Ω
IP↑
3 would be… triple the power. Like Ω
IP↑
2… to Ω
IP↑
2. And Ω
IP↑
4 would be Ω
IP↑
3 to Ω
IP↑
3, and so on. Like you may or may not have guessed, Ω
IP↑↑
2 is
Ω
> than Ω
IP↑
Ω
IP↑
Ω
IP↑
... forever. Also, new terminology,
Ω
> means surpassing, not just 'greater'.
Uparrow Mania

As we get Ω
IP↑↑↑...↑↑↑
with more and more arrows, we need to symbolise all these arrows. Ω
IP↑
n
will be created. N will be the number of arrows. But eventually, we will get to Ω
IP↑
Ω
IP↑
...
and more. So, what about a new notation. Ω
IP↑↑
n
, where N is now the number of layers. Still too many layers? Ω
IP↑↑↑
n
is how many layers of Ω
IP↑↑
n
, and so on. But what about when there are too many ↑'s, again? Ω
IP↑
2
n
. Now, N is the number of ↑s, again. Ω
IP↑
3
n
? N is the number of layers, and so on, just like perviously. And Ω
IP↑
↑
2
n
= Ω
IP↑
n
n
.

After all this, it looks like this notation is bursting at the seams. So, let's define a new notation ~ 
Ω
IP↑
x
L2
. L means layer. So, L2 (layer 2) would be surpassing (
Ω
>) Layer 1, which would be everything else so far. We go L2, L3, L4, and in fact follow the exact same timeline as ↑, except ↑... would be L. We would have LL, L
L
, and finally, when we have L
L
, we'll introduce ML(1). Meta-Layer One, the layer of the layer, surpassing L
L
L
L
...
, forever. Surpassing an infinite sequence of MLs, Meta-Layer Two, Meta-Layer Three, and then we'd have Meta-Meta-Layer One, which is larger than ML(Ω

ML(Ω

ML(...)

ML(Ω

ML(Ω

)
...
... forever, and, well, you know what's gonna happen. After an infinite amount of Metas and whatever, IP is obsolete. It's time for HFP.
Hyperfinite Power
[
]
"Too much powah!"
For the truly massive verses, Hyperfinite Power (Ω
HFP=
y
) is here. When IP is exhausted fully (no matter how many notations you make) HFP is way beyond that. Ж is the first hyperfinite ordinal. It has a HFP of Ω, and is also called Ω
0
. So its HFP is unquantifiable. A HFP of 1 is beyond IP. 2 is if HFP was IP (in which case it would be utterly devastating), it would break IP. 3 is likewise, but with 2. So, A HPF of Ω is... hyper. After this, you have Level 2 HFP (Ω
H
2
FP=
y
), then Level 3 HFP (Ω
H
3
FP=
y
), etc. After all that, you have Level
x
/2 Hyperfinite Power. (Ω
H
x
2
FP=
y
), then Level
x
/
y
/2 HFP (Ω
H
x
y
2
FP=
y
) so on, and so forth. After all that, you have Ultrafinite Power (Ω
UFP=
x
), the last notable notation before the Hebrewfinites. This notation transcends Hyperfinite Power to an unfathomable degree.
Hebrewfinities
[
]
What is a Hebrewfinity? Completely disconnected from HFP, Hebrewfinities are basically, beyond. There are two Hebrewfinite Chains - Alephfinities and Memfinities ~ which are used by Meta-Class 10 objects, such as the
Terminality of All Verses.
Alephifinite Power
[
]
Alephifinite Power is a notation unable to be reached in any way other than going straight to Alephifinite Power. Alephifinite Power is calculated using the notation Ω
א
FP
x
. The
x
in the Ω
א
FP
x
symbolizes how far in you are into Alephifinite Power. Ω
א
FP
1
symbolizes regular Alephifinite Power, this can be represented as 𐌰
1
. At Ω
א
FP
2
(𐌰
2
), 𐌰
1
is basically
True Nothing
in compared to it. You can repeat this process until you get to Ω
א
FP
Ω
(𐌰
Ω
) at which point you can start using the Power of Infinities numbers. The largest possible using Alephifinite Power is Ω
א
FP
𐌰
𐌰
...
(𐌰
𐌰
𐌰
...
or 𐌰
𐌰
), with there being 𐌰
𐌰
𐌰's! After this, you have Bethifinite Power, with an Alephipower Rating of 2. Alephifinite Power has an Alephipower Rating of 1. The notation for Bethifinite Power is Ω
ב
FP
x
. Ω
ב
FP
1
can be represented as 𐌱
1
. You can repeat this process until you reach Gimelifinite Power that has an Alephipower Rating of 3. Then repeat that until you reach Shinifinite Power (Ω
ש
FP
x
) with an Alephipower Rating of 22. The notation for Post-Shinifinite Power is Ω
𐌿
23
FP
x
, which can be applied to previous notations (i.e. Ω
𐌿
1
FP
x
= Ω
א
FP
x
). Ω
𐌿
23
FP
1
can be represented as 𐌿
23
1
. After all possible previous numbers have been exhausted, you get Tavifinite Power (Ω
ת
FP
x
), which has an Alephipower Rating that cannot be written with finite space, or even infinite space! Ω
ת
FP
1
can be represented as 𐍄
1
. The largest number possible using Tavifinite Power is Ω
א
FP
𐍄
𐍄
...
(𐍄
𐍄
𐍄
...
), with the stack of 𐍄's going downwards forever!
Memfinites
[
]
Memfinities (Not to be confused Memifinite Power) with are categorised as Ω
מ
. The first Memfinity is Ω
מin
. Then comes Ω
מin
1, which is 1 tier above Ω
מin
. Fun fact - Ω
מax
is also completely inaccessible from Ω
מin
. In Memfinities, a tier is basically where that number is completely inaccessible to the tier below it, and can only be accessed by the Tier+1 function. It is thereby impossible to travel tiers, unless with Tier+1. And since Ω
מax
is inaccessible by the Tier+1 function, you cannot reach it even with a tier breacher. And, well, there's not really much to it.
This is pretty much the end. For more transfinities, metafinities and gendials, see my page on
