The
QRverse
is a gigantic globe containing digital cube, changing over time. The verse contains neither object nor any existing things, except that digital cube. The digital cube's sides are all QR code. When scanned, it will display random image of verses, structures, voids... anything.
QR code on digital cube will immediately change to display image of different verses, structures, voids... anything. The important property of changing is... that they are completely random. It means, in theory, the QR code digital cube may give images of impossible, or incomprehensible structures. But since the digital cube is not able to randomize probability, chance of that happening is 0.
