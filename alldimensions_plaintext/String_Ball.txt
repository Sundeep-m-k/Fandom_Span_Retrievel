String Ball is an interesting technology of the quark civilization. in fact, they learned how to make different things out of strings. String Ball literally can do either any thing by creating a nano version of elementary particles that a refrigerator consisting of them will be with a quark man.Can even create pocket-sized reality

interesting facts
[
]
the biggest object was the creation of God project. They created a creature the size of a
cell
that destroyed those who wanted to harm the quark civilization. The accuracy was 1/trillion quarks. He was shooting microscopic rays out of his eyes. In the future, his physical strength will come in handy.
the largest pocket dimension was the size of an atom until they figured out how to make a pocket dimension for our "god" who will protect them. This is a
human
-sized dimension.

absolute existence
(the highest peak of potential and absolute control of all strings as well as finding loopholes in the laws of physics in different realities making more strings)
