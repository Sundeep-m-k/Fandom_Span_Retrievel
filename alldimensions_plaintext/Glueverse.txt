Gluometers
, also known as the
Glueverse
, is a very weird verse where it's a giant sea of fast flowing glue with
Grand Ultimaverses
floating around at the
glue sea
's surface. There are no words that can really describe how weird this verse is, so it's name is an image instead.
If a mortal being escaped their local Grand Ultimaverse out into the Glueverse, they'd fall into the sea of glue and start sticking to the glue, then they'd die of suffocation, drowning, and glue consumption all at the same time. It is also ruled over by a giant weirdly colored Doge that is around 13,157 Gluometers big. The word "GLUE" also floats around randomly in this verse.
