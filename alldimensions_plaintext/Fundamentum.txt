Overview
[
]
To the very bottom of Box itself leaves to a ever changing rocky plain of the embodiment of matter itself that is used to form the realities and all of their contents above it, pieces of the land will tear up and file up before dissolving away so it will reform into physical matter for the realities with the ground easily regenerates from constantly tearing, there is no end for when it no longer can create more.
Its creation
[

“
For every Box there comes a Fundamentum and for Fundamentum comes within the Box.
”
— NonUseable, When describing the basic idea of Fundamentum
We understand that; without the Fundamentum, the box cannot have realities and it goes the same way in the other way. Both this and that are always a part of each other’s existences and cannot exist without the other.
Structure
[
]
You really cannot see what it is there because of the lack of natural light but when looking at it from above, it looks like an black solid ocean or a rocky wasteland from a massive explosion but once you stand on it, you feel like you are on your home planet (for us, it would feel like Earth) as you can see and feel the entire plain move around with ease. When you look away from the ground you only can see the black space of the horizon that feels infinite when just standing on it. You can reach the wall’s of the box where the least activity of its job happens as it would be a sandy ground. The entire place feel like you're on a beach if you ever went to one.
Usually a way we can see it is through X-ray scans of the place, this page uses one.
Death?
[
]
There is no way for it to die unless the Box cease existence however it is assume if it does stop at its job, the creations of new reality within the Box will stop, there is no actual proof nor any occurrence of this phenomenon as it is assumed through a couple theories from the YouTube channel "Reality Theories".
Trivia
[
]
You aren’t gonna get killed when standing on it as does its job.
You cannot live on it though as the lands are uninhabitable for life but if you have air, food, water and some stable ground: you stay there forever and not be hurt by it.
If you ever taste it, it tastes like a "banana" but you wouldn't feel it in you as it will dissolved away after the piece you just ate reaches to your stomach.
