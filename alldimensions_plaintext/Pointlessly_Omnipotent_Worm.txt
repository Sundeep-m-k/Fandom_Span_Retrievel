About
[
]
The
Pointlessly Omnipotent Worm
is a
cosmic
deity
with the power to do literally anything. However, it does nothing with that capability, and it may in fact never do anything with it, except live life as a worm, because it is one after all.
Pointlessness
[
]
Being a worm, it is incapable of higher thought and simply feasts on soil, contributing to its ecosystem. One might wonder if this worm is indeed omnipotent, and whether if one is truly omnipotent if one does not use that omnipotence.
Despite its omniscience, it appears to not care about information, only using it to detect predators and more delicious soil, merely following its earthworm instincts. It makes no attempt to ascend to a higher form, or become immortal, or anything else, because it is a dumb worm, that only follows its own instincts.
Faith
[
]
No one knows how this worm is omnipotent or even how its omnipotency is observable. Also, the Worm has his own secret religion called
"The Faith of The Omnipotent Worm"
dedicated to the Worship and protection to the Worm.
