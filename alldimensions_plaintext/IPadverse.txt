Density (Void Percentage)
Seemingly half void and half verse, but >90% void. The void percent is constantly dropping down though.

iPadverses
are
verses
currently residing within almost every
Cetaverse
that's full of
voids
. It's where they contain a set of
Boxes
with different
existence ranks
.
They receive their name because they're usually shaped like iPads, though certain variants known as "collapsed iPadverses" have the more conventional spherical shape, since they have imploded due to their density.
The iPadverses actually aren't either very full (verse) nor very empty (void). Instead, they're huge rare clusters of atypical existence ranks of Boxes. Though they don't contains as much Boxes as Cetaverses (iPadverses contain ~25,000,000,000,000 of them on average), a lot of void may be left for more space for Boxes to be generated.
iPadverses themselves are in various existence ranks simultaneously (mainly existent and nonexistent ones) and that more and more Boxes are formed at, meaning they gain more existence ranks over time.
The rate of the creation of Boxes within our local iPadverse is around 1,509,912 per every
OYC
, so about a million new existence ranks are created, which may be fast, but to occupy the spaces provided so that only some voids are left. This will happen within the next 3.6 septillion OYC (will have a total of 5.4*10
30
). Compared with other iPadverses, it's pretty low. Also, iPadverses are regions in Cetaverses where Box creation rate is at its most, but when they all got enough Boxes, the amount of those won't stay the same forever. At that time, there's sufficient matter to create so many boxes that there will be infinite Boxes long after (due to them having infinite dimensions, so this is a possibility).
