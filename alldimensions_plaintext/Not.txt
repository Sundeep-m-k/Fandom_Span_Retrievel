Not
is a mostly blank verse, as you can see in the picture. It glows an eerie white, there are a handful duplicates of
Always
scattered around here and there. There is also an unknown sort of tall cylindrical thing in the center of Not. It is unknown what this thing does, and it looks like
The Structure
, except WAY bigger.
Also, the temperature randomly fluctuates sometimes. It can be 10 degrees Celsius one second, then infinitely hot the next. That has made surviving in Not very hard. Practically every single possible organism is in
The Building
, and extremely few creatures survive outside of
Always
. Still, there is life. This life is extremely basic as well. They have about the same intelligence as
Scalene
, and they are about as tiny as
The dentist
. No name has been given to them yet.
Other than endless void, fluctuating temperature, negative-sized life, a big cylinder, and some
Always
floating around, there isn't a whole lot to this verse.
Not is contained by our local
