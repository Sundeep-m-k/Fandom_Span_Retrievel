This verse is perhaps the most useful one yet in the object verse chain. You can walk through the extremely long tunnel, but underneath the tunnel, there is a ton of materials. It pretty much has every material in the Omniverse.
The best way to find what you are looking for is to find some sort of fast vehicle to go through the tunnel. This will help you find things easier.
The weird thing is that these object verses really don't make any sense. Why is there a verse that is just a huge tunnel with stuff underneath? And why does this contain the
Youhaveanicepoolinyourbackyardverse
?
Anyway, even though these are really weird and nonsensical, this one at least helps you with what materials you need no matter where you areÂ :)
