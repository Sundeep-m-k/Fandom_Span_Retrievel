Varies because they have 10 phases
Small Axions
are like Class 4
Axions
, but abstractly small in scale. They behave very differently, with 10 phases instead of classes. They contain many
Tiny Axions
, and have different "colors" for each phase. They create abstract layouts, and abstraction topology is considered "non-euclidean".
The reason for the lazy name is because when Axions were discovered, their discoverer also found that scale. He was feeling lazy that day, so he called it the "Small Axion". Unfortunately, the name became too mainstream and spread so much that it was too late to change it for himself.

Phases 5-1
Phases 10 ~ 6
[
]
Axions of phases 10 ~ 6 have different purposes, and behave exactly like regular Axions. Lower phases are incredibly different.
Phase 10 [Higher connection phase]
[
]
Phase 10 connects the abstraction logic to Axions. Likewise, they are thoughts of less-abstractly axioms; which is why Small Axions are "abstractly smaller." Higher-abstractness objects are abstract for all properties at higher scales, and are so theoretical that they result in different abstractions depending on the method of observation.
Phase 9 [Class phase]
[
]
Phase 9 classifies the 5 classes of Axions. As the centerpiece of upper-scale abstraction, the axioms here are unintelligible. Functions become more loosely defined with deeper abstraction and type theory, to the point where it becomes an entirely different "subject".
Phase 8 [Metaphysics phase]
[
]
Statement loops, absences, and metaphysical sections of
null
are constructed at this scale.
Phase 7 [Random phase]
[
]
They are known to translate abstraction into different, random abstractions, regardless of how general they are.
Phase 6 [Lower connection phase]
[
]
The abstraction of nullity starts to take over as we dive deeper in scale, though they are hidden gems for translating lower-levels of nullity.
Phases 5-1
[
]
Phases 5-1 Small Axions are incredibly different compared to other phases. Instead of functioning as instructions for larger things, they "physically" manifest abstract concepts. These phases are only loosely connected and have no one abstraction at a particular moment. At that scale, abstraction becomes even less comprehensible, as they no longer make a "whole" in the traditional sense.
