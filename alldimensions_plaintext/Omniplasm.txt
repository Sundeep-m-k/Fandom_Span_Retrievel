Omniplasm
is a very large variant of subatomicness that is
post-alphasm
, basically a part of post-alphasm’s equivilant of subatomicness, as if everything was post-alphasm, even blueprint particles. It is made of various post-alphasm verses that are smaller than it. It also has a lot of primordium alpha, primordium sigma, and
Fuzzium
. They glow bright enough to destroy your eyeballs by turning them into alphasms... wait, that makes no sense! But it’s true, it happens. BUT YOU DON’T OWN THEM.

Destroying omniplasm will kill many alphasms and will make
Omniphasm
mad, so definately don’t do that.
they make entities that don’t have full access to the core of everything die on contact, except for
Smallians
because they are simply too small to be affected.
Cosmic zaaaaaaaaps
constantly happen, even multiple times per voidsecond, and the created objects aren’t destroyed by the death thingy mentioned above. This occurs much more in pink ones. Omniplasms are contained by the
Omnipoverse
