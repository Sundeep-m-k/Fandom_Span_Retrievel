The Labyrinth is a strange maze-like network of realms and verses. Often, ships end up in the Labyrinth while travelling through empty voids.
Locations

Ontological Museum
- Inbetween verses, one can find themselves in the Ontological Museum, where strange but powerful objects are kept.
Cyber Complex
- This place is built by a hyperintelligent AI. It is full of verses optimized for computation. It harvests resources from other verses, and entities are struggling to fight it off.
Entities

Hyperconstructor
- This entity travels through the Labyrinth searching for things to add to its strange voidship, which is an amalgamation of things from several verses.
The Eater
