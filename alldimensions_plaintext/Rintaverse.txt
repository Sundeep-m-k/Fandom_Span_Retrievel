A
Rintaverse
is a universe that contains
Sortaverses
and
Kindaverses
.
Rintaverse Matter & Fields
[
]
Rintaverse Matter or Stem Matter is almost like an infinite matter source. It feeds off the energy from the
Kindaverses
. When Stem Matter is at a high enough concentration in a
Sortaverse
, it creates shooting ‘tendrils’ of
Sortaverse
matter and Rintaverse matter. These tendrils spawn more
Sortaverses
on their edges, eventually creating a beautiful fractal of
Sortaverses
. As well as this, the Rintavers absorbs the dark fields from the giant
Kindaverses
and converts it into Rintaverse fields, which feed the
Sortaverses
. The Rintaverse isn’t that much of a hazard in of itself, as the
Kindaverses
absorb the excess gravity. You would really only be gravitationally attracted to the tendrils, however, if you are going long distance, it is generally advised to avoid the numerous dangerous structures like sinkholes and portals in the Rintaverse.
! WARNING !
Avoid the "spirals" and "oceans" in the Rintaverse. It's extremely unstable, and pretty much a Udekaplasma (equivalent of undecillions of degrees Kelvin). YOU WILL DIE IMMEDIATELY.
Rintaversian Technology
[
]
Rintaversians have created many-a-technology to aid them in expanding. Rintaversians have full freedom to reroute the fractal tendrils. This causes them to regrow incredibly quickly. While this takes alot of energy, they can harvest the energy from the
Sortaverses
to obtain Stem matter and
Sortaverse Matter
. This is one of the most effective ways to obtain both of these materials. There have been instances of Rintaversians consuming whole
Sortaverses
. This usually leads to all the contents of the
Sortaverse
being expelled.
Tredaverses
may bloat in size and escape, the eviler ones wreaking havoc, as they may even turn into
Sortaverses
. This usually creates a host of problems with the
Kindaverses
mixing with the
Sortaverses
and self-destructing. This, let’s just say, is
not good.
