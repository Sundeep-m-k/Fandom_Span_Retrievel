Purialiconicite is a strange element made of strings that also contains a yellow core.
It has odd properties, as the atoms in the Purialiconicite target other atoms and decimate them, damaging their core, giving the Purialiconicite a more yellow tint and quickly dissolving the object it touched.
After the core has been damaged too much, it will implode, the Purialiconicite string being brought with.
Then, halfway through, it will break free from the core's graitational pull and become
Glitchonicite
.
Merely touching a block of Purialiconicite could cause it to burn your finger straight off.
However, Glitchonicite and Purialiconicite do not react when touching each other, and Hydrochloric acid can dissolve the outer shell turning it into a bright yellow liquid called Glialiconicite which conducts electricity.
