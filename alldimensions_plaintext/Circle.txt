A
circle
is a
rotatope
with no flat dimensions and two round dimensions. It is, therefore, the
2D
hypersphere
. It can also be considered as the set of all
points
that are the same distance from a
point
(the center of a circle) in the
plane
.
In the
plane
, a circle will roll, as it is completely round. The proof of this is that if you trace the path the middle of a circle takes when it rolls, that that is straight. Circle could not roll on other surfaces smoothly.

circle
(1D)
A circle has no zero-dimensional subfacets. Its only one-dimensional subfacet is its edge, which is also, quite confusingly, called a circle. To unambiguously distinguish between the 1D length and the 2D area, the area can be called a "disc".
