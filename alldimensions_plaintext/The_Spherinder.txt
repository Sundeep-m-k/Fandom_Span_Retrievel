The
Spherinder
is a verse that is shaped like a
spherinder
, also known as a spherical prism. It is invisible, and so its image is only a best guess of what it may look like. Its properties seem to be highly related to what it is built from,
the Duocylinders
.
Composition
[
]
Like our previous verses, the spherinder-shaped part of our verse is only the center, and all the other parts of the verse are a hyperspherical shell. Unlike the other verses, however, the barrier is made of
Absolute Darks
and the void is actually... void.
The Actual Spherinder
[
]
So why is The Spherinder invisible? To be honest, we still don't know. It seems that it might let photons pass and nothing else, making it actually a solid object but still invisible. These strange properties of The Spherinder may be related to how
the Duocylinders
work, although this is also unknown as well.
