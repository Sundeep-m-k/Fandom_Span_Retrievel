Timeline of the War
[
]
In 78
OYC
, the
Etrurians
took over the Po Valley which was owned by Terabithia. Tensions skyrocketed about 2 OYC before the war. Eventually, both countries stationed their militaries at the border and got their allies to put some troops there too. Governments around the verse began making plans on what to do if war really did break out. War was looming on the horizon.
The Etrurians wanted to take Terabithia fast, before they had any time to do anything as Terabithia was in the process of militarizing, but first they had to justify it or else the LUA would sanction them which could potentially lead to a revolution. The Estates General had a plan inspired by the outbreak of the Second World War however and it was implemented after careful consideration. They simply launched a missile at one of the Pesoros planets(Charlan) in the
Calamity galaxy
, then the announced that the Terabithians attacked the planet. Reporters and journalists were called in to record the grisly hoax. Etruria officially declared war on Terabithia soon after.
Operation Colonize
[

Skirmish of Charlan
[
]
Pre-Battle
[
]
The Calamity galaxy provided a good battleground for the Etrurians, as the galaxy was unstable and isolated from the
universe
. That was a bad decision though, as all the Terabithians did was evacuate the cities of Charlan and Ikarus. But then the etrurians attacked the pesoros, which was terabithia's ally.

The frontline after the battle of Charlan
When Terabithian-Pesoros forces arrived, they were immediately subjected to the instability of the galaxy, causing about 1 out of 7000 to glitch out of reality and into the
backrooms
. Then the etrurians surprise-attacked them. However they somehow managed to fight back, using bioengineered flesh-eating flies to devastate the etrurians. The Terabithians swiftly surrounded the troops at Charlan and wiped them out to the last man. The Etrurians then sent reinforcements that tried to get through the Terabithian line to encircle them but they were stopped in their tracks by fresh Terabithian troops.
Post-Battle
[

Both sides settled down for trench warfare near Charlan. The Etrurians were just waiting for more supplies to come through, but North-Koreaverse and Chetoma sent about 22 million troops to reinforce the front lines along with 17 tonnes of supplies. The Terabithians recieved 27 tonnes of supplies from Teltonia, 5 million troops from Redland, 12 million from Jejistan and 3 million from Akalor.
The First battle of Meridian
[

Pre-battle
[
]
Frustrated by the hold up at Charlan, the Etrurians tried to infiltrate the west. However, military bases in the region were notified and prepared troops. The extra troops from Charlan were also sent here to help the resistance. They arrived rather late though, when the Etrurians had already penetrated deep into the country. They were shocked. They retreated to the city of Meridian to prepare. Thus the First Battle of Meridian began.

The frontline after the First Battle of Meridian
The Akalorian army charged forwards toward the Etrurian tank units. They were a little successful, but then a large etrurian force pushed the akalorians back, besieged Meridian, and started fighting the jejistani army. A north koreaversian force also charged at the same time, but they divided themselves into 2 and got completely destroyed by the Terabithians. The Chetoman forces were holding off the redlandian forces at the same time more north-koreaversian forces came to back the frontline forces up. The etrurian tank units in the east have taken high ground, forcing the terabithians to send 2 divisions to assist their tank units in the west.
Post Battle
[
]
Etrurian forces advanced down, beating the akalorians in the battle of acheron. The akalorians then retreated a little, but only to make fortifications on higher ground. By then the etrurian army had lost lots of men, but the mission was to secure meridian and they succeeded. The city was almost completely destroyed though.
Battle of Sonokra
[
]
Pre-battle
[
]
The Etrurian army was getting very impatient. They wanted to break through the terabithian line fast, and so they sent stormtroopers to the east of the country. They were especially stealthy, and they secretly broke down the terabithian lines of defense so a wave of regular troops could go through.
Battle
[
]
The Terabithians were taken completely by surprise. The etrurian army managed to destroy 2 huge terabithian armies while advancing. Their navy also destroyed a Terabithian fleet. In the end, etrurian armies managed to take not only Sonokra, but also Tentron, Tubasco and Trent. The etrurian troops managed to burst through the Terabithian line and encircled the troops attacking 2 small britversian troops.
Post-Battle

After the battle, the etrurians halted their advance for a few days to build defenses on higher ground while the terabithian commanders were still working out what to do. Meanwhile, the Etrurians broke the line at meridian and advanced further into the country.
Operation POLARBEAR
[
]
Operation POLARBEAR is an operation by the Terabithians to lure the Etrurians deep into the country, where strong forces are.
Battle of Nixitar

Pre-Battle
[
]
The Battle of Nixitar
The Terabithians had a plan to lure the Etrurian army deep into the country to trigger Petoria into entering the war on their side, since Petoria's industrial areas will be in the range of Etrurian bombers.
Battle
[
]
The Terabithians lured the Etrurians in with the help of an akalorian army. Then the Etrurian forces were completely destroyed by reinforced Terabithian forces and akalorian artillery.
Post-Battle
[
]
The commanders of the Etrurian army were fired and taken over by King Darok III. It was a very bad decision that led to the downfall of Etruria.
The Battle of Forgeheart
[

This is the most influential battle of the war and it determined which side would win.
