The End of the Tunnel
is the end of the tunnel known in
Dark Area
. Anything beyond it is the next step in the infinities. It is very bright, brighter than the
Lightverse
! That’s VERY bright! It’s normal temperature like a normal day on
Earth
. You would probably think it’s very dark but actually no. It’s bright enough to burn your retina. There are two pathways after the tunnel.
Left
[
]
Left will lead you to a all void area called
Leftance
. Not the best path. In fact, the worst path. The only way you can find out is with true omnipotence, since this void tunnel is endless and you will never reach it.
Right
[
]
Right will lead you to a heaven like area called
Rightance
. Not the worst path. In fact, the best path. The only way you can find out is with true omnipotence, since this void tunnel is endless and you will never reach it.
The only creatures that have traveled down the tunnel infinitely to the space between all
The End of the Tunnels
are some omnipotent race of creatures. They are commonly known as the
Entripodalites
.
