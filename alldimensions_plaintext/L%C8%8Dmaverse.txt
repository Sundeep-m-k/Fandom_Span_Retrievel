About
[
]
The
Lȍmaverse
is a
verse
similar to
Undefined
, but unlike it,
atoms
are not transformed. Instead, they're randomly changing their position. That makes
life
,
planets
,
stars
,
galaxies
, etc. impossible to exist.
Example of Lȍmaverse's properties: 3 uranium atoms enter Lȍmaverse, the atom A, B and C. The atom A enters Lȍmaverse in the position 0,0, atom B enters at 0,0.5 and atom C enters at 1,0.8. after one millissecond, atom A changes position to 0.61,0.3, atom B changes to 0.55,0.81 and atom C changes to 0.1,0.7. And this repeats forever.
