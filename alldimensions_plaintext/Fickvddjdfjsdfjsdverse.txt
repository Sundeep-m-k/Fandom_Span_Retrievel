The Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse is a remote verse in the very middle of the
Bigchairverse
, a mostly empty verse. This verse, however, has eight distinct sections, three unique gadgets, and a lot of civilizations. This verse won the Interversal Poll for the most unique and distinct verse in the
Omniverse
.

The A B S T R A C T T O F F E E is a small but sentient object located in the
Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse
. It sticks to the outside of the verse, keeping it stable.
What it is made of
[
]
The outside is made of fine coal, while the inside is made of a strange material. The material is called meurjfribfiuewbfiuebf, and it is very reactive. Whenever it collided with another material, it explodes, deleting the whole coal shell.
How the meurjfribfiuewbfiuebf doesn't explode
[
]
It turns out, coal is the only substance possible that can repel meurjfribfiuewbfiuebf. The coal repels in and pushes it to the middle, and the coal also protects it from many substances. The only problem is if it gets in contact with a gas, the coal won't be able to protect it. Luckily, the
Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse
does not have any gas, allowing the A B S T R A C T T O F F E E's inside to exist.
Significance to the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse
[
]
The A B S T R A C T T O F F E E's fine coal on the outside of it allows it to stick to the side of the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse. However, it doesn't actually stick to it, it only half-sticks to it. The outside of the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse will get stuck to coal in a way that it is difficult to take it off, but it can still move around on the outside of the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse. The fact that it is tilted to it allows the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse to stay stable, since whenever its gravity moves to one side, the A B S T R A C T T O F F E E will move to the same side and stabilize it due to its high mass and acceleration.
Why it is brown
[
]
It is brown because the light from the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse is absorbed by the A B S T R A C T T O F F E E and it creates the brown colour.
How it was created
[
]
It all started when an unnamed living blob in the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse getting really sick of having to stabilize the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse using advanced and inefficient technology, which is how they stabilized it before A B S T R A C T T O F F E E existed. This one blob decided to dig a huge hole into one of the planets, hoping that they would find materials to make something more useful. It found many weird things, like every planet in the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse has, but one of the things it found was a ball with its own gravity. It was also vibrating when someone held it.
It decided to try to grab it, but due to its extremely high reactivity, the blob got sent flying on touch, and got knocked to another planet. The blob couldn't make it back without more inefficient technology, and it refused to use inefficient technology due to saving it being what it did this for in the first place. The ball was left there for a long time until it finally stopped vibrating, and it released a lot of energy. Another unnamed blob decided to go down and get the ball, but realized it was the reason the other blob got flying. It decided to use coal to create a shell around the ball, and realized coal repelled the ball. It took a long time but the blob was able to completely surround the ball in coal. After that, the ball made a noise, and it was estimated that the noise meant the ball had stopped vibrating. This ball turned out to be the meurjfribfiuewbfiuebf ball in the core of the A B S T R A C T T O F F E E.
The completed A B S T R A C T T O F F E E was eventually moved to other locations, without having much of a use, until the A B S T R A C T T O F F E E missed a planet and got stuck to the outside of the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse. However, then, the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse instantly became stable again, in the middle of a stability project. At that moment, the A B S T R A C T T O F F E E became how it is today, and the first unnamed blob's quest was successful.

The F L A M E T O B O G G A N is another small object located in the
Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse
. It has an eternal temperature of 10,000,000 degrees celsius, so it is always flaming due to the thin atmosphere the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse has.
The F L A M E T O B O G G A N bounces around the sides of the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse at a ludicrously fast speed, going all over the place.
Its purpose
[
]
The F L A M E T O B O G G A N is supposed to keep the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse from staying still and getting hard, because when the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse stops moving for 10 minutes, it will die completely along with everything in it. Since this object is bouncing around, the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse never stops moving, so it never dies.
The F L A M E T O B O G G A N can also move celestial objects in the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse, which sometimes knocks them out of orbit and occasionally creates collisions. This is also necessary since the objects will die if they stop moving for 7 days. In the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse's entire history, only 4 objects have ever died with the F L A M E T O B O G G A N bouncing around, which are listed below.

The structure
[
]
The F L A M E T O B O G G A N's inside is just a regular toboggan. It doesn't have any handles, and it doesn't really have a texture, but it has a curve at the front. Other than that, that's about it.
However, the outside of the F L A M E T O B O G G A N is flaming with fire, due to its hot temperature. This fire used to be cold, however, so the flame actually never changes shape.
For an unknown reason, each flame at the top has a civilization living in them. They are all microscopic, but they are simply
weird.
The civilizations
[
]
First flame
[
]
The first flame has a civilization of pufferfishes. They are red, and they are 2 micrometers long. They normally swim in a straight line for all of eternity, and when they hit the end of the flame, they swim back.
Second flame
[
]
The second flame has a civilization of sentient drops of boiling water. They are approximately 19 micrometers in size, and they are transparent so you can see their organs through them from the outside. They survive in the flame because they produce excessive sweat all the time. Since there isn't any food in the flame, they survive by eating each other. Eating an eighth of another drop will allow them to survive for a full month.
Third flame
[
]
The third flame is inhabited by a very similar civilization to the second flame, but all the sentient drops are zombies. Therefore, they are green and don't produce sweat, so the average life of a drop is reproducing in under a second, and then dying.
Fourth flame
[
]
The fourth flame has a civilization of molecules that have molecules inside them, typically being 77 micrometers in length. They cannot move whatsoever, but they create many resources by moving and shooting their molecules. Therefore, the average lifetime of one of these is about 3 months. This flame used to be the tallest of the flames, but when an elephant from the fifth flame came it got much shorter.
Fifth flame
[
]
The fifth flame's civilizations are tiny elephants. They are 89 micrometers long. They float around in the flame, and the average lifetime is about 2 months. These tiny elephants can inhale part of the flame using their trunks and then shoot them at another elephant, killing them. This is how they normally get food. There are two different types of microelephants in this flame: Tylers and Tylerds. Tyler type elephants have four legs and are very fast, but Tylerd type elephants have 10 legs and are very slow. One elephant managed to make it out of this flame part and made it to the fourth flame, which made the fourth flame much shorter.

The S P A T I A L L O O P E R is the final object located in the
Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse
. It is the main thing that controls what the verse does. This verse is unconsiously controlled by every living being ever, including you.
Structure
[
]
The outside is made of iron, but it is tinted green. The sticky material of the outside has caused the iron to react and turn a green colour. The shape is an icosahedron because that's the shape it was when it was created. It isn't a trueicosahedron, because it isn't 3D, but it is the icosahedron equivalent of the dimension it is in. It hasn't changed from its shape in the span of its entire existence.
The inside is an extremely reactive hypersphere, which floats in the middle of the S P A T I A L L O O P E R. It is made of solid hydrogen, so it is very cold. This is the part that is unconsiously controlled by everyone, and the rest of the S P A T I A L L O O P E R is pulled along with it.
Purpose
[
]
The purpose of the S P A T I A L L O O P E R is to keep the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse in a good and functioning state. It is theoretically "polling" all beings, to figure out which decision would be factually correct, as it would go with the majority. Due to this, the S P A T I A L L O O P E R does a very good job at making sure the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse doesn't dysfunction.
It can move around and alter its surroundings in basically any way, but it only does the correct choices due to the "polling" aspect. It also bounces around the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse and repels away from other objects without pushing said other objects, just so it doesn't hit anything. It can bounce around the sticky material at the border of the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse.
How it works
[
]
The way it is able to be controlled by literally every living thing is due to three specific, random beings that have more of a role than other people. One of these can even actively control it, completely consiously.

Name of role
Description of being
Role
Consious controller
It is simply a blob that has very high intelligence. It is this one blob in the middle of space.
It consiously controls the S P A T I A L L O O P E R and it gets the controls of every living being, one at a time, in around 1.2 seconds, every 1.2 seconds.
Signal sender
This being is just Leftunknown. He is one of the top editors on this wiki.
He unconsiously sends the signals to every living being, by simply moving in space. The quantum movements are interdimensionally connected to sending signals from the S P A T I A L L O O P E r.
Response checker
She has no personality, and no character, and she isn't very smart.
She analyzes the responses sent by every living being unconsiously and applies them to the S P A T I A L L O O P E R.
