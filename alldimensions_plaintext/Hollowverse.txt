Hollowverse
is a
Universe

There isn't much to be said about the Hollowverse, as it is merely an invisible roaming shell of a once Universe. It is incredibely rare to find any sort of information written in these, aside from the obvious "I am a lonseome barrier. My grasp used to confine such visual wonders, alas, my host is forever gone now" that is encoded in a sort of Reality-encoder, but is translatable to concepts and equations.
For some beings, they can interact with the bare bones of a Hollowverse, like if it bore any significance alike to that of an actual Universe. These beings use the Hollowverse either as a mechanical part in a machine, home "island" of sorts, and some more uses.
