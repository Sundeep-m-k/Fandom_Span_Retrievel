Khraktaverse
is a type of
verse
which is found in
Metaverses
. Khraktaverses contain Khraktcells, but the main feature of them are Khraktanies. Khraktanies are gods who have total power over their Khraktaverse, and they are the source of energy in the Khraktaverse.

Structure
[
]
Khraktaverses are 3-dimensional and sphere-shaped, so they're like universes, although they're much smaller than them at only 10 to 20 ly in diameter.
A few thousand to million Khraktcells exist in each Khraktaverse.
Khraktaverse cross-section
When a khraktany is giving energy to their khraktaverse, the khraktaverse is composed of a main zone and a dead zone.
Main zones
comprise almost all of the Khraktaverse. Things like Khraktcells exist here.
Dead zones
are the zones around khraktanies that are too energy-rich for khraktcells and other organisms to exist in.
Khraktcells
[
]
Khraktcells are extremely large, living creatures, having an average size of 10,000 km. Unlike what their name says, they are not unicellular organisms.
Khraktcells are analogous to
Planets
in
Universes
like
ours
, with their own gravitational pull. A lot of times, there is life on and inside of the Khraktcells.
Birth
[
]
Khraktcells are made from Khraktacell spores, which are sometimes emitted by khraktanies while emitting energy. These spores collect the energy from the khraktany, eventually becoming a khraktacell. This process usually takes a few millenia.
Death
[
]
After a few billion years, khraktcells lose all life and die. However, their bodies stay floating around rotting. They usually disappear in 200 - 600 years due to decomposition by other organisms.
Khraktanies
[
]
Khraktanies are gods who rule over every aspect of their khraktaverse. They can do anything inside of them and change any characteristic about them, but they can't do these things:
Leave the khraktaverse
Destroy the khraktaverse
Manipulate anything outside of the khraktaverse
Die until the khraktaverse splits
Delay their khraktaverse splitting
Most of the time, they are the only energy sources in their khraktaverse, in which they spend considerable amounts of their time in the center of their verse giving off light. Exceptions are cases when they create specialised energy sources to give out energy for them.
Khraktaverse life cycle
[
]
Birth
[
]
Khraktaverses are born after an existing khraktaverse divides in two. The division process normally takes less than a millisecond, and any type of structure will find itself in a random new khraktaverse. This means that half of the new khraktaverses are completely new, being eventually filled out by their khraktanies.
Death
[
]
Khraktaverses live for around 1 billion
OYC
. During this time period, they eventually build up instability, which they discharge at the end of their lifetime by splitting in two. The khraktany inside of the khraktaverse also dies, turning into 2 new khraktanies.

Note: This does not include all Khraktaverses. There have been over 5 billion discovered.
