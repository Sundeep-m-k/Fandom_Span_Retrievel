The dunkeyverse is a verse filled with dunkey worshippers. They worship dunkey kong, and they themselves are mini-dunkey kongs with less than an infinitesmal of his powers. They are mostly the same as dunkey kong except they are limited to dunkeyverses. Each dunkeyverse has a very small box-sized bridge connecting them to other dunkeyverses. Only mini-dunkeys and stronger entities can use them without vaporizing. Each dunkeyverse has approx. 1,000,000 mini-dunkeys, with the most ever known being 2,346,732 and the least ever known being 327,431. These mini-dunkeys are actually not called mini-dunkeys, but are just called dunkeys. However, they are not called dunkey kongs or mini-dunkey kongs. Just dunkeys. Dunkeys just either constantly worship dunkey kong or do nothing or do smaller stuff or do big jobs, ect., but most just worship dunkey, and just sit around in their free time (when they aren’t worshipping dunkey, about 1/1,000,000,000th of the time)

DUNKEY FORMS
[
]
each dunkey has several forms that they can take. Well, some of them have one. They need to go through advanced training to take on stronger forms. Only 1/120 can be silver dunkeys. Only 1/400 can be lime dunkeys. Only 1/2,700 can be heaven-ascended. Only 1/18,000 can be r u n. Only 1/127,300 can be egg kong. Only 1/700,000 can be funy kon. Only 1/3,000,000 can be egg act 1, 1/20 million can be egg act 2, 1 in 170 mil can be egg act 3, and 1 in 500 million can be egg act 4. However, 1 in 70 billion can be bruh, 1 in 6 trillion can be uh oh, and 1 in 75 decillion can O B A M A. Oh, and 1 in googol can be metal. Also, 1 in infinity are the prism variant and are stronger than real dunkey kong’s normal form. Even in metal form, they still are decillions of times weaker than dunkey kong’s normal form. For comparison, it takes them 2,345,726 OYC to break o r b’s shell in metal form, while it takes the normal form of the real dunkey kong just a few hours.
HOLES
[
]
For some reason, dunkeyverses have many holes. Holes like black holes. You can find a black hole every 4 ly. 4 ly called 100 rarity in the holes system used in this verse by dunkeys to measure the rarity of each hole. Black holes have a rarity of 100. White holes repel things and have a rarity of 140, making them rarer than black holes. Gray holes alternate between being white and black holes effect-wise, and have a rarity of 700. Red, orange, yellow, dark blue, light blue, and cyan holes heat things up by 1,000,000, 300,000, 75,000, -75,000, -300,000, and -1,000,000 degrees celcius, respectively. These holes all have a rarity of 500. Dunkeys are unaffected by white and black holes but somehow still are affected by 0.001% of the gray hole’s effect. Other holes are theorized to exist, but have not been discovered by the dunkeys yet, if they do.
STRUCTURE
[
]
The dunkeyverse is cube-shaped. Well, sort of. It’s the equivalent of a cube for 17.2 spacial dimensions and 6.7 time dimensions. However, each tunnel has only 10.4 spatial dimensions and 2.2 time dimensions, and are “triangle”-shaped. There are somehow 4 spatial dimensional and 0.4 time dimensional beans floating around that range from the size of a
universe
to the size of the
uber realm
. In the center, there is a fortress that has a forcefield around it.

, and other strong beings can penetrate the force field, but the weakest forcefield-piercers are the dunkeys, which can do it even though they don’t meet the power threshold. The sesbots fly around and Y E E T rogue dunkeys and other evil or threatening entities, they are the law enforcement of the dunkeyverse. Ocassionally, the dunkeyverse enters a different form. This is surprisingly common, happening only every few OYC days.
forms
[
]
locked
[
]
a dunkeyverse becomes locked every 4 OYC days. The lock lasts for 0.7 OYC days. When it is locked, most entities, excluding higher omni-gods and dunkeys, cannot enter or exit the dunkeyverse because of toxic acid gas that kills most lifeforms on contact.
corrupted
[
]
the dunkeyverse enters the corrupted state every 13 OYC days, and lasts for 1.4 OYC days. When it is corrupted, “weak” entities that come inside it are corrupted and become evil. “Weak” entities are entities that are dunkey power>1,000, meaning that 1,000 or more of them combined are weaker than a single dunkey. Dunkeys hate this form of universe.
