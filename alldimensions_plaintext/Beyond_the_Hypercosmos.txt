Reason for Classification
Due to proof that verses beyond the Hypercosmos.
Beyond the Hypercosmos is a concept that there are verses beyond
The Cosmic Truth
even though
The Cosmic Truth
is not a verse but another concept!
But in case you think this is last concept of having no end to verses then you are terribly mistaken because there are still infinite more and even when you reach infinite somehow then the infinites will go on forever.
The longest quote for no end (don't delete this and feel free to add)

"There are infinite more concepts which will go on forever and you know what I mean by now because this repeats forever already and just... stuff" - Wonderfulandcaringguy (and everyone of course)
If I still use this wiki when I die then my final words will be "Remember there is no end to the cosmos and hypercosmos and it will go on forever and remember how hard you can try it is still nowhere near the end but you can try and it will be a fake "the true end" so repeat the same thing again and remember it goodbye"

Beyond the Hypercosmos
is a verse which is beyond
Hypercosmology
! So as you see the infoboxes are weird because all of the scales (except for size) is like 9,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 (repeating forever)
We also know that in this verse and beyond it is impossible for verses to exist.

V: Hi.
J: Hi. What do you want?
V: We want to ask you what do you believe in Hypercosmology.
J: What kind of question is that? I believe that everything exists because I've seen it, and I have also gone beyond Hypercosmology.
V: *silent* *breathes in* HOW THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT!
J: *sigh* if I tell you your brain would explode.
V: Oh okay. *thinks about the simple times*
V: Ah I remember when we used to think the Multiverse was the last thing.
J: Ah your right.
H: What are you talking about the Multiverse is the largest verse!
V and J: Shut up.
V: Well you are saying there is no end right.
J: Yep.
V: Wow this was a remake of The Cosmic Truth.
J: Oh. Well bye for now.
V: Bye.
