Before anything, this article isnt really my idea. I just wanted to add it to AD wiki, but its a lot shorter than the OG one. Here is the OG one:
Transcendentem
The
Trascendentem
is a huge barrier which contains an insane amount of
Beyond Bubbles
. Each one of the Bubbles are separated because if they collide, it could cause an massive cosmic extinction event, which could destroy
Omniverses
,
Barrels
or even more.
If someone without enough power leaves its local Bubble, it will perish in seconds. Only very powerful beings could be able to live in this place outside the Bubbles, and even stronger ones could have the neccesary power in order to rule a Transcendentem.
