Fedorgi is an extremely weird and isolated verse. All the life found inside of this verse are creatures from all over that got trapped. Most likely, they first accidentally went into
The Seeker
's voids and got themselves trapped in Thingk. Then they went to
Mandelbrotstuffsokay
and found
NO
, and got trapped here.
The life here has found out ways to cooperate and build a sizable civilization. They get their energy from occasional dimensional portals from
.:
, another anomaly found inside
Mandelbrotstuffsokay
.
There are rumors that the civilization in Fedorgi is extremely advanced, and way stronger than it actually is. That has made creatures purposely go inside
The Seeker
's voids. That didn't go well, and many creatures got stuck in
Thingk
forever.
Before any creatures came into Fedorgi through
NO
or
.:
, there was absolutely no life here.
