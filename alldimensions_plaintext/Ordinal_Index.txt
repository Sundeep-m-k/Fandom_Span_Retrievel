An
Ordinal Index
is a system created by
Fish
, mainly for
TAH
. It may also be called OL, for Ordinal Level, but they are one and the same.
They are similar to the
EUSI
or Soupcount (V&D) While OLs predominantly align with
TAH
, it should work with any hierarchy or verse. The concept is simple - each type of
verse
is assigned an ordinal, starting at 0 for
Universes
, 1 for
Multiverses
, etc.
Unlike
AO
, if a verse has a finite number of layers its OL is finite. For any infinite set of verses, the OL of verse that contains them all will be the limit ordinal of that set's OL so an ω × ω verse will contain an ω verse (
Omniverses
), the ω × 2 verses (
Diplomniverse
), the ω × 3 verses (
Veromniverse
) ... all the way for every Omni layer. And as, such the
Barrels
have an OL of ω × ω.
Some other examples is that
Metaarchverses
go from 10
24
to infinity, thus Omniverses have an OL of ω. The
Barrelplexes
contain all the
Sublimes
(see TAH), all of which represent a countable ordinal, thus the Barrelplexes have an OL of ω
1
.
