Contained by:
DIARRHEAverse
Contains:
POOPverses
,
SHITcreatures
,
Rules
etc.
The SHITverse is a bigger version of
POOPverses
, because all the ''unique''
POOPverses
have now combined, which creates a SHITverse.
And so, did SHITverses merge, createing
DIARRHEAverse
Rules
[
]
The rules here are insanely strict. So follow them. Or else.
The only color allowed in SHITverses are brown. Any different color will get you put in
Turd Pillars
. Even if the color is slighty different, you will still get put into the
Turd Pillars
Any imprisoned creature that doesnt obey
Shrek
, will have their mouths stuffed with long, smelly, hard turds.
But anything outside the SHITverse will not have any rules about color, or obeyment. So you dont have to follow any of
Shreks
rules outside the SHITverse
SHITcreatures
[
]
These SHITcreatures are the size of entire universes, which make them a trouble to fight. But if we ignore that, we will see that these SHITcreatures are just similar clones of
Shrek The Poop God
. They can merge and become multicellular creatures, just like in real life.
The SHITcreatures rely on
POOPverses
to survive and make
Baby Katas
. As you see every SHITcreature must preduce
Baby Katas
, or the get punished. And the SHITcreature who can produce the most
Baby Katas
, will be put in a labatory. So
shrek
can produce the most
Baby Katas
out of these SHITcreatures.
Propertys
[
]
The SHITverse has plungers on the outside, which grapple space junk (or anything) from 1000 parsecs. So if you ever get close to the SHITverse, please be careful.
The SHITverse can send drones out, so
shrek
can fill his tummy with junk
