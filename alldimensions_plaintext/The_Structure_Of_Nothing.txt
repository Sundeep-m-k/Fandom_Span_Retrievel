The
Structures Of Nothing
, also known as the inverse versions of
Structures Of Everything
, are regions accessible by
hyperdimensions
lower than spacetime. They're still bounded in a specific Hyperdimension and can be
supercontained
. They work sort of like a fundamental particle, being the stabilizer of everything in their local Structure Of Everyhing.
The Structures of Nothing can also be seen as "portals" to smaller and null-sized objects, and a portable
omnipocket
in-between
null-sized
and spatial particles. The size and dimensionality of them is in-between surreal zero and subzero, in which they have no sign but still have a value assigned; and composed of a incomplete form of Dimensional Blueprint Particles.
They're ruled over by many null-sized entities, who live in them.
