M Class
[
]
Stars with M class are called red dwarf. They are generally cold (between 2000 and 3500 kelvin) and are less massive than the majority of the others star, but they have a extremely long life period, they live aproximately 1 trillion years, and they are one of the most abundant star in the universe. One of the examples is like Proxima Centauri.

K Class
[
]
Stars with K class are called orange dwarf. They are pretty cold but hotter than red dwarfs (between 3200 and 5300 kelvin). They have less mass than the sun but can by very close to one solar mass, they live generaly 30 billion years. They are the best star to have earth like planet.
G Class
[
]
Stars with G class are called yellow dwarf, they are hotter than than the twos previous class (between 5300 and 6000 kelvin). Star with this class are very famous because the sun is one of these. Others stars with this class are Alpha Centauri A and Capella (Capella is an yellow giant, you will see what they are later). They live Aproximately 10 billion years.
F Class
[
]
What can looks like a F class star
Stars with F class are called white main-sequence star, they are more massive than the sun and hotter (Between 6000 and 7600 kelvin). Star with this class have a life less longer than the sun, they live aproximately 4 billion years. An exemple of a star with F class is Procyon A.
A class

A class stars are called blue white main-sequence star, they are even more massive and hotter than F class star (Between 7600 and 10000 kelvin). They have a very short life time, aproximately 1 billion years. Here is exemple of blue white main-sequence star, there is vega and sirius A.
B class
[
]
What can look like a B class star
B class stars are even more massive and hotter, they are extremely hot (Between 10000 and 35000 kelvin). They have even more short life time, aproximately 100 millions years, extremely shortsÂ ! This class is the hottest one before the O class.
O class
[
]
What can look like a O type star
O class stars are the hottest star (Between 35000 and 60000 Kelvin), they are so massive that they live only a fraction of the lifetime of the sun, its abount 10 millions years, you can be sure its impossible to found earth like planet around a O class star.
Exotics Class

U class
[
]
Stars with P class are so rare that its possible there is none of these stars in our milky way. Star with P class are so massive, so hot (Between 60000 and 200000 kelvin) that they only live 100,000 years, they mass are about 2000 solar masses. When these stars die they dont blow up in a hypernova, the whole star is collapsing, creating a worm hole, they are the only stars that can create a worm hole.
N class

N class stars are very rare and still unknow these day, we call they cold class star. They are composed of carbon, oxygen and helium, these star emit cold light, that mean every planet orbiting these star is going to cool off really fast, this effect can be cause of the amount of dark matter concentrated on these star, they have a extremely high gravitation. Their radius are only about 200 km.
Life Class
[
]
Life class are class for the life period of a star, let start now to see what they are.
PR class
[
]
PR class are the proto-star, proto-star are the first stage of an star, they are created from dust and gas that got from nebula, the rest of an supernova. Generaly, there is not a lot of planet orbiting these star due to the fact that proto-star are very young.
VII class
[
]
VII class star are white dwarf, they can only have heat class from K to O but cooling off we could get some M class white dwarf. So white dwarf are residue from star with a mass between 0 and 8. They was originally the core of the star but because of the star fuel being helium, the exterior layer expand in a red giant and became a planetary nebula, the core being the core of the star staying in the center of the nebula.
