The
Straverse
is a group of giant, not-so-peaceful planets, each one having a special trait. The first copy of it (and thus the original) was built by Innimums Industries, which at that time was operated by Johnny "Johns" Stevens III. Unlike the
cosmicialverse
(where former guardians Aria Flower and Jerry Lassa operate at now), the
straverse
has over ω↑

The
Straverse
itself consists of an universe-like resemblance, however is bigger than a huittaverse. It has a large planet in the center that acts as a gathering place and a home for the straverse staff (that is everything but the inhabitants of the
Straverse
.
The
Straverse
has billions of planets, ranging from a simple yet effective one to a bizarre and ridiculously powerful one, including:
Altes
Critera
Gurium
Jaymora
Unitolo
Zefro
Altes
is an interesting planet located in the
Straverse
where people could build anything technological (as long as it's family friendly and not questionable), whether it's something useful, interesting or funny.
Critera
is a happy planet located in the
straverse
that's filled with luck. It is made out of luckium, a custom substance made by Johnny "Johns" Stevens III to make the cosmic entity feel much luckier by manipulating cosmic entities of its rank and even higher-ranked ones (but not much higher-ranked ones). This is one of the seven original planets.
Gurium
is a rich planet located in the
Straverse
that's made entirely out of precious metals (which are much less brittle than the actual precious metals), such as emerald, diamond and gold. Due to this, it is the most raided planet. This is one of the seven original planets.
Jaymora
is a world full of food of all kind. This, however, was quickly surpassed by many kinds of food generators, as all of them allow the customizing of the food without any hard limit.
Unitolo
is a powerful planet located in the
Straverse
that teaches the power of unlimited magic and how to use it properly.
Zefro
is a "positively chaotic" planet located in the
straverse
that's filled with endless possibilities. It is the jack of all trades - you can build, learn magic, get money and get lucky, as long as you're not something illegal. It has more free will than any other planet, making this the best verse in this list. This is the last of the seven original planets.
History
[
]
In -3
OYC
, Johnny "Johns" Stevens III founded a company named "Innimums Industries", with the sole purpose of giving power to everyone else and himself. In 7 OYC, Innimums Industries discontinued power making with the release of a new kind of universe called the
Straverse
, with only seven planets. Its purpose was to make everyone in this universe happy and to make everyone working on the company exponentially powerful because of this universe. After just one year, 120 billion copies were made, so seeing how successful it would be, he quickly added more and more planets, going as far as up to 3 million unique planets until he was retired in 59 OYC.
In 11,250 OYC,
Joey Dave
took position as the CEO of Innimums Industries, replacing
Ray Cylix
.
Joey Dave
is an active CEO, being active on the headquarters at all times and always being ready when anyone needs help. During his rule,
Dave
showed coolness and activity. He banned people who are incompetent in ruling a
straverse
and ruled straverses that no employee ruled.
Dave
did almost everything to help the people on the
straverses
, making him the golden age of Innimums Industries.
In 11,303 OYC,
Jason Kwilight
took position as the CEO of Innimums Industries, replacing
Joey Dave
.
Jason Kwilight
is a calm CEO, sporting much less emotion and much more kindness. During his rule,
Kwilight
showed kindness and even teaches all the employees how to rule a
straverse
, only banning those who only wants to rule the
straverse
for power. He did a lot to help people in the
straverses
. In 11,335 OYC,
Asa Illuminov
killed
Jason Kwilight
and replaced him as the CEO.
Asa Illuminov
did not maintain the "Innimum Industries" name - instead, he destroyed the name, banning many employees who did virtually nothing wrong in ruling the
straverse
, hiring ones that are either incompetent or wants to rule something else, but not a
straverse
, even doing nothing to help people in the
straverses
. After just 5 human years,
Illuminov
was not only fired from Innimum Industries, but also killed by
Johnny Gabe
, his successor.
Johnny Gabe
is far more capable and more liked than his predecessor, reviving the "Innimum Industries" name instead of brutally murdering it like its predecessor. During his rule,
Gabe
banned employees who are incompetent in ruling a
straverse
and quickly found replacements that he thought would all replace the incompetent employees. He did pretty much half of everything to help people in the
straverses
.

Inhabitants
All leaders of official
straverses
are employees of the core Innimums Industries.
Straverses
who are not led by employees of the core Innimums Industries are likely
ripoffs of the
straverse
. They lead every cosmic entity in the
straverse
, including the
straverse
inhabitants, the guardians, the moderators, the administrators and even the
straverse
police officers.
They have the ability to destroy the
straverse
itself, change the ranks of every other inhabitant in the
straverse
(excluding themself), ban other people (excluding themself) and prevent other people from making changes to some of the planets at will.
The leader cannot be replaced, except when they're retired, when they couldn't rule the
straverse
(whether from the beginning or anymore) or when it is declared by Innimums Industries that they wanted to take control of the
straverse
for themself.
The straverse police officer has the highest authority in the
straverse
(unless when the leader counts). They have the ability to change the ranks of every other inhabitant in the
straverse
(including the
straverse
police officers, but excluding themself and the leader), ban other people (including police officers, but excluding themself and the leader) and prevent other people from making changes to some of the planets at will.
The administrator has the second-to-highest authority in the
straverse
(unless when the leader counts). They have the ability to change the ranks of every other inhabitant in the
straverse
(excluding the
straverse
administrators and higher authorities), ban other people (excluding the administrators and higher authorities) and prevent other people from making changes to some of the planets at will.
The moderator has the second-to-lowest staff authority in the
straverse
. They have the job to protect the entire
straverse
and have the ability to prevent other people from making changes to some of the planets at will.
The guardian has the lowest staff authority in the
straverse
. They have the job to protect a certain
straverse
planet from an army of invaders.
The inhabitant is the only authority that is not a staff, and is the weakest and the most common of all the
straverse
cosmic entities.

Johnny Gabe
is the current CEO of Innimums Industries. He is far more capable and more liked than his predecessor, reviving the "Innimum Industries" name instead of brutally murdering it like its predecessor. During his rule,
Gabe
banned employees who are incompetent in ruling a
straverse
and quickly found replacements that he thought would all replace the incompetent employees. He did pretty much half of everything to help people in the

History
[
]
Johnny Gabe
was born in 11,335 OYC, 28 human years before
Illuminov
became the CEO. Like Jason Kwilight, not much was known about his life - it was presumed he lived like a normal human being until he heard about
Asa Illuminov
destroying the "Innimum Industries" name, the name of the company he knew all about.
Gabe
quickly came to rescue the "Innimum Industries" name, and fought
Illuminov
to death. Though it took a lot of time and suffering,
Gabe
finally defeated, killed and replaced him. From then on,
Gabe
became the "new and improved" CEO of Innimum Industries.
Asa Illuminov
is considered the worst CEO of Innimums Industries, and is considered one of the worst cosmic entities of all time. During his rule,
Illuminov
brutally murdered the "Innimums Industries" name, banning many employees who did virtually nothing wrong in ruling a
straverse
and hiring ones that are either incompetent or wants to rule something else, but not a
straverse
. He did nothing to help people in the
straverses
. After just 5 human years,
Illuminov
was not only fired from Innimum Industries, but also killed by
Johnny Gabe
, his successor.
History
[

Asa Illuminov
was born in 11,335 OYC.
Illuminov
has been a smarter-than-average cosmic entity, often going to the cosmos library to learn about all the things in the cosmos. During the time when he wasn't the CEO of Innimums Industries yet,
Illuminov
acted like a kind, generous and humble person. However, he always wanted to rule a verse and be the leader of many. However, he lived a normal life, except that he's trying to act like he's an excellent person.
When he was 20 human years old,
Illuminov
killed
Jason Kwilight
and finally got (more than) what he wanted: Ruling a verse and being the leader of many. When
Johnny Gabe
heard about
Illuminov
destroying the "Innimum Industries" name,
Illuminov
was fought to death by
Gabe
. Though it took a lot of time and suffering,
Illuminov
was finally defeated, killed and replaced by
Gabe
, putting an end to his rule.
Jason Kwilight
is a calm CEO, sporting much less emotion and much more kindness. During his rule,
Kwilight
showed kindness and even teaches all the employees how to rule a
straverse
, only banning those who only wants to rule the
straverse
for power. He did a lot to help people in the
straverses
.
History
[

Jason Kwilight
was born in 11,294 OYC. Not much was known about his life - it was presumed he lived like a normal human being. When he was 18 human years old, he began working as a designer of verses.
Kwilight
is a highly respected designer, being known by people as a great example of an excellent designer - even considered by few as the best designer. Due to this,
Kwilight
eventually expanded into a versatile designer - from designing clothes to designing computers to designing another cosmic entity.
He eventually retired as a designer in 11,297 OYC and switched to being an employee of Innimums Industries. He gradually ranked up from being an employee to being a chief operating officer, at an even faster pace than
Joey Dave
. On 11,303 OYC, he finally stepped up into a CEO, operating all of the straverses and having control of all the company. On 11,335 OYC, he was killed by
Asa Illuminov
, who afterwards became his successor.
Joey Dave
is an active CEO, being active on the headquarters at all times and always being ready when anyone needs help. During his rule,
Dave
showed coolness and activity. He banned people who are incompetent in ruling a
straverse
and ruled straverses that no employee ruled until he found replacements.
Dave
did almost everything to help the people on the
straverses
, making him the golden age of Innimums Industries.
History
[

Joey Dave
was born in 11,243 OYC. Ever since his birth,
Dave
has been a great cosmic entity, winning hard competitions, like building the fastest and most efficient spaceship possible. When he was 20 human years old, he began to work at Innimums Industries. He gradually ranked up from neing an employee to being a chief operating officer. On 11,250 OYC, he finally stepped up into a CEO, operating all of the straverses and having control of all the company. On 11,303 OYC, he retired as a CEO and chose
Jason Kwilight
as his successor.
Ray Cylix
is a passive CEO, who's not bad at worst. He likes to help someone and ban incompetent people in an effortless and kind way. He found great replacements for people he banned without any effort. This makes him the only CEO who doesn't like effort.
