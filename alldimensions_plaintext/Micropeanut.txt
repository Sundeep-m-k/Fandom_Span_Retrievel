Micropeanut
A deep void. At this level, nothing exists, nothing has existence rank, nothing has even a positive amount of properties, yet to Micropeanut, this is part of normal life.

Micropeanut is a genderless
W.E.N.D.
that can extract metabits out of
Zyorons
and consume the metabits. This may cause mildly inaccurate data from low level
Omnipockets
but it's usually so minor that it usually has no significant effect on the outcome. It was discovered in 10,128
OYC
when technology was almost advanced enough to observe things in
H(-2)
.
In 11,152 OYC it picked up a
Thingk
, and has been carrying it ever since. It still doesn't know what it is to this day. It can also communicate with
Transcendent Omni-Gods
, as one unknown TOG gave it that ability.

Structure
[
]
From the outside, Micropeanut looks like a peanut with 1 eye, a mouth, and a slight irregularity in the grid pattern of the shell. It can produce abstract waves that can only be measured in H(-2), and they reflect off of other objects directly back to Micropeanut which gives it information about it's surroundings. The waves move at instantenous speed (it always takes 1
Voidsecond
for the waves to reach a particle and then go back to Micropeanut) and there are 256 made each voidsecond. This allows Micropeanut to see in 256 pixels. At least it's better than the Youtube video quality when your wifi drops by one bar. The 2 edible seeds inside it have different purposes, and have been named the Physical and Conscious Edible Seeds respectively.
Physical Edible Seed
[
]
The physical edible seed is responsible for harnessing the power of metabits for generating a forcefield, moving, and seeing. It has multiple parts. The first part is connected to the mouth and harnesses the metabits. The second part uses the power from the metabits to generate the forcefield that protects it. It was also inserted by
The Forcers
in an operation. The 3rd part makes the abstract waves and shoots them out the eye to see. The eye when it receives the abstract waves that were reflected will send the information to the Conscious Edible Seed. The 4th part creates shell material and locates it to broken off pieces.
Conscious Edible Seed
[
]
The conscious edible seed is responsible for thinking and sending signals to the PES to move. It requires power from metabits to operate, so cutting the line that sends metabit power to the CES would kill Micropeanut fairly quickly. We do not know how it works, we just know that it makes Micropeanut sentient.
Positional Cords
[
]
The positional cords are the strings that connect the other parts to the shell. If you cut one, it won't affect Micropeanut much, but they're to prevent the parts from getting damaged by being hit against the shell.
Shell
[
]
The shell is obvious what it is. A barrier resembling a peanut, acts as secondary shield if a dangerous particle passes the forcefield.
Incident
[
]
In 10,798 OYC, various entities were searching for Micropeanut and some were actively trying to kill it. One of these entities successfully attacked it and broke off a portion of it's shell, causing some pieces to become loose and only held onto Micropeanut by positional cords. Slowly it recovered and the shell was fixed, and the only remnant of the incident is the pattern on the shell being slightly messed up.

what
we gave you the ability to talk to togs
what's a tog
at this level it's not important.
ok
a
oh you got struck by an
anti-concept
what's that
it's not very important but just know to avoid them
what's this here
that's a thingk
idk what that is but i'll take it anyways
