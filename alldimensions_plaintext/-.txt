are Sub-Xial particle verses which possess a very simple form, a feature which led their discoverer to label them -. This is also the convention used here. They are the particle verses that compose

(Tinies)
. Things contained by or composing - appear to be perpetually at risk of being destroyed, due to the unstable nature of - particle verses and their poorly understood physical dynamics.
These particle verses are structurally composed of even smaller particles known as
- -s
.
Why are - unstable?
[
]
Due to their size, and in spite of their simple composition, - particle verses appear to be always horribly unstable. They deviate significantly from just about every hypothesis proposed under any scrutiny. The particle verses do not appear to be chaotic in nature, yet in spite of this every sublogic system applied to them thus far fails to accurately predict their behavior. This road block threatens to greatly increase our understanding of outer-logic should we surpass it.
Life within a - particle
[
]
Whether life can exist within a - particle at all is entirely unknown, but not implausible. If living creatures exist within the bounds of the particles, it may have defensive methods against its apparent instability. If they do not, the inconsistent inner state of a - particle could destroy the entity, or serve to propagate its offspring. Nothing can be confirmed until the evolution of the inner state of a - particle over time is better understood, or such an entity is directly observed. With the advancement of our current understanding, either outcome, or neither, could prove truthful.
