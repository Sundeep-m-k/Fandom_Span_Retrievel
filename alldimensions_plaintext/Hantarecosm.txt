Structure
[
]
The Hantarecosm is composed of 3 circles which orbit randomly around a central point. We have not discovered what they are made of yet, but it has an existence rank of 0, meaning the material is imaginary. Various planets are suspended in these circles, which can be subdivided into 2 classes: Intersection worlds, which position is the intersection of 2 of the circles, and Orbital worlds, which orbit normally on the circles. If two planets are about to collide, they phase into the 4th dimension termporarily.
A circle takes approximately 40 million years to make a full rotation, and an orbital world takes approximately 100 million years to make a full orbit.
Orbit
[
]
The Hantarecosm resides in our
Gigaverse
, orbiting around a
megaverse
called MGA-29,442. This megaverse's laws impede it from having any sort of life. The Hantarecosm has an orbital period of 76 quintillion years and is at an average distance to MGA-29,442 of 1 septillion light-years.
Worlds
[
]
The Hantarecosm has 18 rocky planets called
Worlds
of different size, 6 intersection and 12 orbital; The largest one is W4 at a diameter of 31,520 km and the smallest one is W12 at a diameter of 1,521 km. All worlds have some sort of life on it, while W6, W17 and W10 have intelligent life.

World 1 is a world with endless hills with yellow grass and the occasional lakes. It has a thin atmosphere which is composed of similar things to
