Formation
[
]
UNI-3's had its big bang happen 9.7 billion years ago (~4 billion years after our universe's formation), likely from the coagulation of the Inertio Supernebula (that also sparked the big bang of our universe and UNI-5039). For the next few million to billion years, it cooled down and expanded into the universe it is today. Its date of full death is estimated to be 200 trillion years from now.
