Megaverse of Reality
The
Hyperverse of Reality
is the only verse in this chain to not have a fractal in its center. It contains its 177,312
Megaverses of Reality
inside huge containers known just as "Containers". There are also occasional
Thingks
floating around, although they are very rare.
This verse's dimensions change randomly and without warning. The unstability of the Hyperverse of Reality is also freaking high. That makes life here a lot rarer. This life is also a lot less advanced than the life in the Megaverse of Reality and the
Multiverse of Reality
.
There is an extremely hot core at the center of this verse. It gives off tons of deadly radiation and also has a strong gravitational pull. Some Megaverses of Reality have gotten into an orbit around the core, and have been completely destroyed due to the temperature and the radiation. The heat spreads throughout the entire verse, and even outside of it.
The life in this verse usually lives on the surface of the Containers. They have built their own verses on the surface. They are called
Surfaceverses
by many creatures.
The space between the Containers and the core is just a big, vast, and empty void.
