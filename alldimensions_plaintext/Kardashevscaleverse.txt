Another one of those pointless placeholder entries in the object verse chain, but this one is again, slightly cooler than the last one.
The thing is, people on this wiki don't seem to understand what Kardashev Scale even is, so I will explain.
Kardashev Scale is a way of measuring how a civilization's technology evolves based on how much energy they can get from different celestial body ranges. Type one is from their planet, type two is from their solar system, and type three is from their whole galaxy.
The cool thing about this verse is that it is the origin of Kardashev Scales without having a civilization. Even though the scale is not really an object, being unique is another part of being a cool thing in a chainÂ :)
