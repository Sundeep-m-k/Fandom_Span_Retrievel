Introduction
[
]
A
Hekc
are absolutely tiny things (like anything else below an
atom
, in fact). If you were the size of a
dentist
, this would be as small as an atom.
A Hekc can change its color, but not as often as a
Hevv
.
Colors
[
]
Red
[
]
Hekcs turn red when they're being repelled by some other tiny particle, like a dentist or another Hekc.
Blue
[
]
This type of particle turning blue means it changed to a different state of matter. The only way this is still possible is due to the
absolutely tiny atoms
within them.
Gray
[
]
Gray is the default color of a Hekc. It means that they're chilling and not doing anything relevant. This is the most common color a Hekc can have, obviously.
