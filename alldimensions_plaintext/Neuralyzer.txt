Power
Abilities
When used, it behaves as a way to calm down the brain of an entity. It technically has infinite power and potential being able to adjust to the size of any entity to fit upon their arm.
It can also be a way as an addiction, however the Neuralyzer acts a single mind detaching from its host once it begins being overused. This is meant as a small dopamine rush in the brain to stimulate for awhile, however it shouldn't be overused. If overused, and the Neuralyzer for say is forcefully restrained, the host's nerves in the brain will collapse and literally kill them from the inside. It majorly depends on tolerance. Human brains can last for 5 hours before it begins to detach as a basis.
Immunities
Undefined, most likely anything almost.
Weaknesses
Being overused too much by a host.

is a powerful device being able to adapt towards any
being
's arm and preferences at pure will and possessing an unknown level of sentience and intelligence. However, this 'entity' is able to purely help any entity by stimulating their brain neurons. How does it do it? No idea. Why does it do it? Because a long, long time ago some entity decided to create this from their knowledge and also as a way to seek pleasure in themselves.

has a rough outer shell made of a very durable substance in order to withstand high amounts of heat, cold, or stress inflicted upon of it. A pure black it is and made of a few gear basings stacked on top of each other. The thing itself is a rectangle but is flexible to become almost any shape from any dimensionality. The front piece is a cog symbol pulsating from a circular bulge in the middle of a black line to differ from gray pale color as it constantly changes a light neon color (light neon red, orange, green, etc.) Implanted on both sides, three diagonal capsules rest on the top of the sides of the device, flashing the same color as the symbol calmly and chambered in black and godlike originated glass from presumably a literal god of glass. Below these is small openings for ventilation and to prevent overheating on both sides again, the inside being fully blocked off by a strange substance, constantly changing color like the other pieces said before. The front has two columns and 4 rows of diagonal small marks, the same as the small openings stated before but instead separated by the black line. On the front's far lower edges, 3 thick lines rest having openings for stronger ventilation. The device can fold itself to only the front piece as the

is meant for armed or legged things, this process being a great way to latch upon other organisms.
Inside of this strange device rests a simple purple orb of striking power, connecting by electronic (invisible) wires charging the device alongside omni-potent energy stored inside from genesis beings of certain multiverses, nicknamed
ORIGIN
(s). The color of the device comes from stars, and a small, very small piece of Prismize from the
Ethereum Zenith
. Alongside this, the device cannot be simply duplicated and requires for you to just build it. You can make infinite theoretically, but you can't duplicate it at all just building it, which takes around an
eon
(''
1,000,000,000 years)
to build. It is also... very lightweight oddly.
I mean, what else did you think this was going to be made of ever so simply? Earth materials being able to shapeshift and handle many dimensions like a causal feat? Get a load of yourself.

The

is a simple set of abilities actually.
One of the major abilities that it possesses is being able to neutralize and also stimulate any being's minds at no cost at all, and it can apply to almost anything automatically, with also applying to their preferences on relaxation methods.
Pros
[
]
It can help reduce anxiety obviously, curing a normal human in a month of usage of ANY anxiety towards anything. The extent of this towards other things isn't known, but it is just as effective probably. On top of this, provides really good relaxation.
Approved by 10/10 gods who used it.
Unlimited usage practically at any time and being able to adapt to your body alongside preferences providing good usage post-battles against certain stuff, such as stimulating and calming your brain down. It can also seem to cool down your entire body or vice versa, heat up your entire body to a likeability so perfect.
Looks extremely cool to flex off.
Doesn't kill a mortal after wearing it and doesn't make them into a slop of radiation because it has
93022808423884932
radiation levels or something like other devices not meant for normal people or entities.
It provides a small augment on the user's stats such as speed, strength, and durability (as a multiplier of 1.02 to 1.2,) and full immunity to neutron stars (why is broken down later.)
Withstands almost anything except being overused,
VERY
overused.
Cons
[

It literally can kill you if overused.
However, this part of overused can actually automatically detach from the host to prevent from dying, showing a sense of sentience of this part section of the entity. How the hell does it how sentience? Nobody knows. Just don't strap it onto you with extreme force so you can feel a bit more stimulation for no reason.
Beyond this point, if you manage to grip on for a few more moments your brain begins to melt as the device launches into hypercharge, as a way to instead kill the host for no more usage making it heavily dangerous to keep using for overused amounts of time.
Anyone can develop an over usage addiction and actually become too dependent upon it. There is no stoppage or self-mechanism of this part, so it can naturally develop. This severely weakens the mental stability of people than anything else and can mess up their IQ due to the high levels of interaction in their brain.
Over addiction can eventually kill you also like the overused part. This is different however as it is prolonged periods of time again and again (like a human using this for 3 hours every day) instead of overusing fully (like a human using it for 5 hours and dying.) But the usage for higher end beings can extend for a few days or months or years, but the effects are more passive then straightforward then shorter timed entities.
Only one exists as of now since nobody is spending an eon currently building another one, so someone having this could get into a fight or get killed quickly. The records of people that have been killed are in the millions, some lasting a few hours, some a few million years, some being just given up out of pure fear. It can also drastically rough up a perception of time making days feel like months.
It requires neutron stars,
one entire neutron star
, just to charge up for 24 hours of usage making it very hard to reuse without high amounts of strength.

With the power to purely adjust to anything's size or width, theoretically the
N
e
u
r
a
l
y
z
e
r
is an infinite size depending on what being it hosts. It can pretty much at that logic expand omniverses, or be the size of below a single atom,
it just has to have a brain
. (1 braincell minimum to classify strangely.)
The host doesn't require an arm although the device is better suited due to that. If the user does not have any arms or legs as an alternative, it'll be attached as a flat surface (only containing the front part) to attach upon and be taken off (where it will reconstruct into original form.)
If the host is a gelatinous mass it'll submerge into the mass on the most outer layer using the same form for non-legged beings,
The furthest breakdown is where the being doesn't have a comprehendible form (being made of pure light) so it will just attach to a group of atoms simply.
