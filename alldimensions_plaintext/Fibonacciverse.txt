The
Fibonacciverse
is a
verse
with a diameterÂ of the
(observable
universe
diameter in light years)
-th Fibonacci number in light years, which
roughly
estimates to = F

light years in diameter. In the
Fibonacciverse
, objects can
only
be in the shape of the Fibonacci sequence. A object without this shape could make the entity or even the universe start falling down.
Objects, particles and distances can
only
be a
Fibonacci
number in size, length, volume, area and angle, with
no exceptions
. Thus,
anyone
and
anything
who attempts to enter the
Fibonacciverse
gets resized and reshaped (and possibly, stuck
permanently
).
