(Note: Please do not take this as actual maths, I just came up with this and thought it was cool)
First, we shall declare that all real
numbers
form a circle, with 0 at the bottom,
CAI / Ω
at the top,
Infinity
(
ℵ
0
) on the right, and Negative infinity on the left. However, we shall use
σ
(lowercase sigma) as Negative infinity instead of -
∞.
ʃ
[

THE FIRST SET - ʃ
ʃ
is the symbol used to symbolise this entire set, it is also equal to:
n
÷
0, n · Ω
∞
-
∞
,
σ - σ
ε is sort of the 'midpoint' between 0 and
∞
, same goes for δ but with 0 and σ
THE SECOND SET - ɼ
0 and Ω are considered 'absolute numbers', and
∞
and
σ
are classified as 'infinite numbers' (unsurprisingly)
ɼ
[
]
We can go beyond ʃ, the symbol for this, new, weird set is called 'ɼ',
Its 'version' of 1 is
Vsaue
aka 'Λ'
Now obviously, we can continue with this, getting bigger and bigger sets,
The
ƒ
ractal nature of numbers

Here is a list of the first eleven sets:
Set 0:
∅ "Nul"
Set 1:
ʃ "San"
Set 2:
ɼ "Ret"
Set 3:
ɭ "Luth"
Set 4:
ʈ "Top"
Set 5:
ȴ "Ler"
Set 6: ʝ
"Hok"
Set 7:
ȶ "Thyo"
Set 8:
ʆ "Shop"
Set 9:
ʄ "Zun"
Set 10:
ʃ∅ "San-Nul"
Set 11:
ʃʃ "San-San"
As you can see, this is in a base 10 system, and is just going to be another longer number line, we can turn this into another circle. Set
Vsaue
is the version of 1 in this set.
THE METASET - ʃ₂
This is the 'The metaset', we can then do the same thing with this to get
ɼ
₂ and so on, eventually we will get the set: ʃ₃.
Going on and on and on with this forever we will eventually get ʃ
∞
, but that's not the end, we can do this for every other number, beyond infinity.
Obviously, you can use the set numbers as set numbers themselves (e.g ʃ
ʃ
, ʃ
ɼ
, ʃ
ʃ
2
etc.)
But no matter how much you do this, you will
never
reach the inaccessible number beyond
all this...
ƒ.
(Note: 'ƒ' is pronounced "Ful")
