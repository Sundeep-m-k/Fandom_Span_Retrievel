A
line segment
(sometimes also referred to as a line, though technically "line" refers to a 1-dimensional space of infinite extent) is 2 connected
points
. It can also be thought of as the set of all
points
the same distance from another in one-dimensional space; thinking about it this way, it is the 1D
hypersphere
.
