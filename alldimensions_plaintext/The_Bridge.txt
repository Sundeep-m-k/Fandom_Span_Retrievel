The Abyss
The Bridge is a huge superstructure suspended above the milky black liquid of
The Abyss
. Those who fall into this liquid while attempting to traverse that verse will end up in the Bridge.
The Bridge stretches infinitely, and there is no way to escape. Countless beings, even Omni-Gods, have disappeared by being trapped on the Bridge.
Those who are trapped in the Bridge inevitably begin to slowly go insane.
This is encouraged by the fact that the Bridge attempts to play with the minds of its victims, by doing things like transporting them back to their home  only for them to go outside and see the bridge, once more before them.
Gigantic humanoid creatures roam the Bridge, attacking any who they come across. These creatures are made of a solid form of the dark liquid that comprises a majority of The Abyss.
If you somehow escape the bridge, you will be back in the bridge next time you close your eyes.

Structure
[
]
The Bridge appears from the outside as a fractal seemingly made of manmade bridges. However, when traversing it, it will appear as a single suspension bridge that is crossed horizontally. Every now and then, there will be towers with archways to go through, after which the Bridge’s victims are transported back to the start of the Bridge. At the top of these towers, there are rooms containing several weapons and other useful tools. The towers are connected to the bridge and held down, so that they don’t fall off, by several
Threads
, which also create the time loop. These Threads are neutralized and will not vaporize beings that touch them.
The Bridge is made of
Primordium Delta
in several different colors.
Occasionally, animals will appear randomly to provide food for the victims lucky enough to find the weapons. Seemingly, the Bridge wants its victims alive so they can  experience as many of it’s terrible tricks as possible,
What Does the Bridge Do?
[
]
The Bridge will do many things to progress the insanity of those unfortunate enough to be forced to wander it, including the aforementioned transporting back home only to see the bridge again, as well as many effects, including but not limited to the following:
Creatures Killing Fake People
[
]
After traveling through an archway, the Bridge may summon a fake family member of the victim that crossed said archway, calling for help. As the victim gets closer, one of the humanoid creatures that roam the Bridge will lumber over to the fake person and morbidly rip them apart and eat them as the victim of the Bridge helplessly watches. The creature then disappears.
Loud Music
[
]
Sometimes, a horrifying, screeching, sound of several broken instruments will begin to play right in the victim’s ear. This sound progressively gets louder until the victim is on the ground crying, their eardrums burst.
Flashing Lights
[
]
If the victim looks off the side of the Bridge, they will see many different flashing colorful lights, which can cause very bad eye strain, headaches, and seizures.
Microwave Arch
[
]
When going through an archway, sometimes, a door on the other end that wasn’t there before will close, and it will begin to heat up, burning the victim. Once they pass out from the heat, the door will open again. If they are not able to wake up in time, they will certainly be eaten by one of the creatures.
How People Become Insane
[
]
Those trapped in the Bridge will slowly become insane, usually over about a year, due to the tricks it plays and the isolation and feeling of no escape. This usually happens over several stages, at first, they are still thinking somewhat rationally, attempting to find an escape. Then, they accept that there isn’t one, their mind becoming very crippled. Then, they will begin to attempt to kill themselves, having hallucinations. Afterwards, they begin to not even stay in one place but rather roam aimlessly, still irrationally searching for an escape While the effects of the previous stage are still present. Eventually, they will mindlessly do this Until they starve.
