About
[
]
The
Waterfalls
are huge objects that allow things like
Too Bigs
to form within them. This is because the water inside the Waterfalls is actually around 10% boiled interversal plastic, a
substance
that can easily be made into -
verses
.
Formation of contents
[
]
Most of these verses form at the bottom of a Waterfall, although a few end up forming at their top or the "falling". These special -verses are typically more orderly, are divided into more structures, have less dimensions, etc. However, these -verses typically have 0.00001x the energy of the rest of the -verses, including thermal energy, making the verses very cold and hard to survive in.
