The Pencil Language (
yeb wakab kef-waf
or more commonly
wakabewafow
) is an extremely ancient language which is widely used. It was created by the
awef'na
and uses a 16 character alphabet.
Apostrophes/dashes can be used to join prefixes/suffixes to regular words. This happens often.
The letter for "k" can also be pronounced as a "g".
The letter for "e" can also be pronounced as an "i".
The letter for "h" can also be pronounced as a "l".

Grammar
[
]
The Pencil Language's sentence structure is SVO.
The Pencil Language uses the nominative-accusative alignment.
Adjectives, Adverbs, and Descriptive Nouns
[
]
Adjectives and adverbs all go before the thing they're describing, and adverbs behave like adjectives.
For descriptive nouns, a copula, "fen", is prefixed onto the descriptive noun, and the copula acts as the verb. For descriptive nouns that are described with an adjective, the copula "fen" will go onto both the adjective and the descriptive noun.
Definite and Indefinite Article
[
]
The definite article is an infix, "yeb", which can pretty much be inserted anywhere in the word as long as it follows the phonotactics. If the phonotactics do not allow "yeb" to be inserted within the word, "yeb" will become a prefix, and if the phonotactics don't allow that either, "yeb" will be broken off of the word entirely and go before the word. The indefinite article is unmarked; for example, "kef" can both mean "creature" and "a creature".
Agreement
[
]
Adjectives and nouns will agree on person (if the noun has person marking). This agreement is extremely simple, with the noun's person marking also going on the adjective and also maybe being modified to obey the phonotactics.
Case Marking
[
]
Here are the cases their case markers:
-(')ow = passive voice
-(w)op = locative/genitive case
-(')ol = instrumental case
-(w)of = dative case
-(n)osga = roughly translates to "into"
-(w)ek = nominative case
-(a)fef = accusative case
-(b)ef = used to mark indirect objects and/or nouns not very relavant to the sentence/phrase
-(w)uw = intransitive verb marker
Nominative and Accusative Case
[
]
The nominative and accusative case are very important as they form the basis for The Pencil Language's person marking. The nominative case goes on the subject while the accusative case goes on the object. If the phrase/sentence does not have a subject and/or an object, the person marking disappears. If nouns are inflected for something other than person marking or are joined to a larger word, the person marking disappears (with the exception of inflecting for number).
Locative And Genitive Case
[
]
The locative case and genitive case are marked with the same suffix, -op. However, the location of the possessor/"locator" relative to the patient determines if the -op is the locative case or the genititve case. If the possessor/locator comes before the patient, it is genitive case, and if the possessor/locator comes after the patient, it is locative case.
For example, "probop kefeefek" = "a verse's civilization", "kefeefek probop" = a civilization within a verse". As you can see, swapping between the two cases changes the roles of the patient and the possessor/locator in the phrase/sentence.
Habitual Case
[
]
Habitual case is expressed through a "joiner", which is 'e'. The joiner can be prefixed onto a verb to show that the verb usually happens and a noun can be prefixed onto the joiner to specify which thing is doing the action. During this process, the person marking on the noun will disappear.
For example, "kanuw" = intransitive form of see, "ekanuw" = to usually see, and "prowekanuw" = thing that usually sees/thing that sees/seer. The 'e' joiner in conjunction with a verb and a noun can be used to show that the noun is the agent of the phrase/sentence (the passive voice indicator, "-ow", can be used to negate this and turn the noun into the patient).
In order to show the object of the phrase, the object is simply added after the word and the intransitive verb suffix is removed. For example, "prowekanuw" = "thing that sees"; "prowekan kef" = "thing that sees a creature". The person marking is removed even though a subject and an object are within the sentence. You can also specify how the action is performed via adding another word after the object and the instrumental case is added to the end of it.
Dative Case
[
]
Aspects
[
]
The Pencil Language has 3 aspects: imperfective, perfective, and another imperfective for instantaneous verbs in which the action keeps happening.
Wul- = perfective aspect
Apwul- = imperfective aspect
Wulapwul- = imperfective aspect for instantaneous verbs that keep happening
In order to negate aspects, you add a new negator, "an-", to it.

Causality
[
]
In order to show that one thing causes another thing, you use the joiner "o" (refer to the "Habitual Case" section for info on joiners). Just like the 'e' joiner, the noun is prefixed onto the joiner and the verb that the noun causes is suffixed onto the joiner. For example, "
