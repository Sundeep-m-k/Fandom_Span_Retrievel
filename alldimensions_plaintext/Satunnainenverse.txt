Outside
[
]
The Satunnainenverse's outside is simply made of a bunch of gas. This gas consists of many random gasses and it is not the same as a regular gas. The gasses are mixed together in a physical way, where they each slot through each other via other dimensions that don't exist. If too much gas gets in one place, it will explode and turn into a bunch of less dense gas. It is likely to turn green for a few minutes, but then it will go back to the normal brown colour. This is why there are a lot of small patches of less dense gas in some parts of the Satunnainenverse.
Anything that is liquid that gets into the outside will become a gas until it goes out of the outside, and then it will turn back into a liquid. This only happens with liquids and another state of matter that only exists in the 2,593,284,205,824,284,607th dimension. However, if a gas that used to be a liquid entered the outside, it will turn back into a liquid directly after exiting it.
The outside also contains the Meditoran Section.
Inside
[
]
The inside has a bunch of energy, that changes to different things all the time, but it never really impacts anything outside of it. It has a force that pushes things around the middle of it, so the core of it does not have any force to push away from the core, which is why the core is fuller of objects than the rest of the inside. However, the inside also contains the Creactor Rore, which is very notable for its object production mechanism.
Creactor Rore
[
]
The Creactor Rore is a very large icosahedron in the Satunnainenverse that generates everything that goes into the Meditoran Section. It contains a mechanism that generates seemingly random objects to put inside the Meditoran Section. The Creactor Rore is around 30 x 10^^23 ly long.
It is not possible to get inside of it without special tools, because it is made of a very strong and unflexible material. Also, the interior of it is very fragile and all of the interior is connected, meaning the action of going inside of it could potentially mess up the mechanism inside of it, so not much useful deduction could be done by going inside of it. However, it is possible to see through it, because it is comprised of a material that is visible in some dimensionalities it is in, but not in other dimensions, despite the fact that it exists in all of the dimensions it is in, so the entire mechanism of it has been visualized.
Creactor Rore Randomness Mechanism
[
]
A diagram of the mechanism's logic.
The Creactor Rore Randomness Mechanism is the part of the Creactor Rore that allows it to generate a random object and send it to the Object Creator. These objects are seemingly random, but have a strict process that decides them, keeping control of them.
While the mechanism does not physically create the objects or generate them from thin air, it conceptualizes them by taking data and applying them in new ways to create
The mechanism has four main phases. Each phase has a different set of instructions, and they keep repeating in sequence over and over again to produce more and more objects to put in the Meditoran Section.
Extraction phase
[
]
(This is the blue part in the diagram.)
A sample set of objects from the Memory Container (dark green) is taken into the Data Extractor (blue), and the Data Extractor finds all properties from the set of objects. It does this by finding everything that at least two of the objects have in common, and then storing it as a property. Anything that is common between two objects is considered a "property". This data is sent to the combination phase.
Combination phase
[
]
(This is the green part in the diagram. Four nodes are shown for visual convenience, but there are usually thousands.)
The data from the extraction phase is sent to the set of green represented data nodes, with one node for each property. This phase will go through every possible combination of the properties, with some having only a few of the properties, while others having almost all of them. This will usually result in new properties being created by combining the factors of two other properties. There will be n! new objects created during this phase, which are sent to the collection phase.
Collection phase
[
]
(This is the yellow part in the diagram.)
This is the shortest and fastest phase. The data from the n! new objects is sent to the Memory Container and also sent to the Meditoran Section. This allows the mechanism in the Meditoran Section to create the objects, and it also means the objects will be stored in the Memory Container for future use in the MCNPDT-phase.
MCNPDT-phase
[
]
(This is the dark green part in the diagram.)
After the data from the objects is sent to the Memory Container, they bounce around the borders of it. Since this process has happened so many times, the Memory Container currently has hundreds of trillions of objects inside of it, all bouncing around. While the MCNPDT-phase is happening, the objects that happen to be closest to the MCFDT-tube (the fat black tube) get taken and sent to the Data Extractor for the process to repeat yet another time.
The MCNPDT-tube is a type of NPDT-tube, or "non-physical data transmission tube", which is a tube that detects non-physical objects and transports a copy of their properties to a different location while keeping them physically stationary. The "MC" in the name is referring to the Memory Container, the object that it is attached to.
Meditoran Section
[
]
The Meditoran section is a large section in the outside part of the Satunnainenverse that stores all of the objects created in the Creactor Rore. It also has a mechanism called the Meditoran Mechanism that creates the objects sent from the Creactor Rore's mechanism.
These objects are simply stored in this section, not doing much, but sometimes, a few of these objects are removed from the Meditoran Section for practical use outside of the Satunnainenverse. Therefore, the mechanism in here and the Creactor Rore's mechanism have not been touched much because they are already useful right now.
The Meditoran Section is pretty empty other than these objects, but the outside is made of a web of simple matter than creates a border than can be gone through easily, but not accidentally, allowing for someone to go inside, but not for the objects to escape.
Meditoran Mechanism
[
]
A diagram of the Meditoran Mechanism.
The Meditoran Mechanism is comprised of three different parts, each of which help transfer the data from the Creactor Rore into reality as well as properly dispose the leftover data.
This mechanism also moves around the Meditoran Section very fast, meaning every object comes out at a different location.
Spindles
[
]
For every object given from the collection phase in the Creactor Rore Randomness Mechanism, the following happens:
The object's properties are placed in nodes and attached to their own spindle. Property nodes that are more "definitive" of their object are "heavier", due to the fact that the object will depend more on those properties and integrate them more into itself. Therefore, the more definitive properties are better at combatting the force pulled by the spindles and reach the blue scanner first. It is important that these definitive properties reach it first.
This happens for all n! objects from the collection phase during the current cycle, so the scanner needs to scan n! different sets of nodes.
Blue scanner
[
]
The blue scanner is used to scan the data nodes in order from most "definitive of their object" to the least. It applies these in that order to a once property-less object to turn it into the object from the collection phase. It recognizes when an object is complete when a node is much heavier than the previous one, which must mean that it is part of a new set of nodes. This entire process of scanning a single cycle of objects from the Creactor Rore Randomness Mechanism takes around 0.7 seconds to fully complete.
Data Disposal
[
]
After a node gets scanned by the scanner, it is sent to the Data Disposal Tube and slowly travels through it. They all go through it very slowly, so it takes around three and a half months for an object to travel fully through the tube. The tube is also in different dimensionalities than everything else in the Satunnainenverse, so it will not disrupt anything else in the Meditoran Section.
After these data nodes are disposed of and come out of the other side of the tube, they usually change to some other form of energy, like a recycling bin. This is because these data nodes do not really have anything else to do in the Satunnainenverse, and since they are a form of energy, they can be changed into something more useful, so the nodes usually change to a new form of energy.
Meditoran Section Applications
[
]
Since there is such a wide variety of parts in the Meditoran Section, some of them have been removed from the Meditoran Section and used for practical work. Some of them might be useful tools to get things done faster and more efficiently, and some might be completely new objects that had not have been made before by formulaic minds. It is considered to be a very reliable source of products, since anything can happen in there. Theoretically, every tool and product, no matter how useful, is still just one object out of the infinite number of possible objects than can exist. Therefore, it is not unlikely that the next major tool revolution may originate from a random combination of properties from the Satunnainenverse.
