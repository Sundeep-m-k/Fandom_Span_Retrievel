A Salbot (Prob Thawpay Prow in
The Pencil Language
) is a machine
used to salvage damaged/useless things all across the cosmos
.
Just like the
Sealbot
, Salbots have
been very useful after wars
, as debris, unusable spacecraft, and destroyed verses had to be cleaned up. Due to this, most of the Salbots were created right after wars.
Salbots, unlike the other
Utilibots
, are
much harder to produce
, as they need to be big and strong enough to fit in entire spacecraft/verses and compress them.
Salbots are shaped like a cube, and have relatively big compressors inside of them which compress all the material it is taking in. There are different models of these compressors, with some being strong enough to turn a piece of debris into a
black hole
. Salbots only have 1 arm which is used to drag debris inside of them to be compressed.
A Salbot can fit roughly 143,023,234 cubic meters of material into itself, although larger Salbots with stronger compressors can fit all the way up to 13,439,675,046 cubic meters.
The Salbot got a 12/16 by
