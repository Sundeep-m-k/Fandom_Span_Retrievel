Buddy's Ordinal is well, an ordinal. It can be described with
ƒ
. So how do we describe it? It would be like the wheel that was on
ƒ
. Heres a print of the first layer, |
The symbol is a Delta, even though its in math kinda.
The first layer.
The next layer, " has the ƒ and ʆ on the corners and | on the top with -| on the bottom. This continues with every layer (layer 3 would be " on top, | and ʄ would be on the corners, and the ƒ on the sides, with -| and the others would be ) Repeat this ƒ times. You will get Δ.
First 10 Layers with some infinites
