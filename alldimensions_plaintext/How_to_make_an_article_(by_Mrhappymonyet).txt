How to decorate your text
Text decoration
is similar to using a
<b>
tag to bold your text, or a <u> to underline it . But the text-decoration attribute takes this farther, giving you wavy underlines, or colored strikethroughs. Text-decoration is a useful HTML, CSS, and Wikicode/Wikitext attribute that this guide will teach you how to use.
The Code
Basic Text Decoration
Let's start with a few examples:
Overlined text
The code for this:
<div style="text-decoration: overline">Overlined text</div>
Strikethrough text
The code for this:
<div style="text-decoration:line-through">Strikethrough text</div>
Underline-overline text
The code for this:
<div style="text-decoration: underline overline">Underline-overline text</div>
Common text decorations can be achieved through tags like <b> for bold and <i> for italic. But text-decoration takes this farther—you can create a combination like an overline, an underline, and italics! The format for this is: 'text-decoration: *type*'. The types of text decoration: overline, line-through, underline overline, bold, italic, underline. You can mix the types together by putting the names and a space between them.
Colored/Styled Text Decoration
There are 2 other attributes
inside
of this that define even more things; the exact style of the decoration, and the color. First, let's look at the text-decoration-color attribute. The format of this is 'text-decoration-color:*color*'. Replace *color* with a color (HEX code, RGB, Common Color Name).
This is an example of red text-decoration
The code for this:
<div style="text-decoration: underline overline ; text-decoration-color: red">This is an example of red text-decoration</div>
The other attribute; text-decoration-style is like border type, but for text instead of the entire coded item. The format for it is 'text-decoration-style: *type*'. Type should be replaced with one of the following: solid, double, dotted, dashed, wavy. Below is an example of a wavy underline.
Wavy Underline
The code for this:
<div style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: wavy">Wavy Underline</div>
We can also combine all three attributes to get this:
Wavy Green Underline
The code for this:
<div style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-style: wavy; text-decoration-color: Green">Wavy Green Underline</div>
(These are basic text coding, you can actually do a lot more with source code but it's too complicated to mention here).
Images
Adding images is a great way to make your page better. I will show you how to add one to a page.
Step 1:
Step 1
Click on the image icon near the top right of your page.
Step 2:
If you want to add a image that you have already uploaded onto a page, find it in the "Search" tab but if you want to upload an image you can press "Upload" and click on the "Select a file" button and upload the file.
Step 3:
This is optional but if you want to move your image to the left side of the screen(the picture is automatically at the right side), you can use this code:
|}
<</div>
|}
<mainpage-endcolumn />
<mainpage-rightcolumn-start />
<div style="border: 1px solid red; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; margin-top: 20px; border-radius: 5px; width: auto;">
</div>
