Facts
[
]
God is illiterate so that's why its called the poiple tyangle.
Everything in this verse has a purple tint.
This verse is dangerous to exist in because it has stuff called poiplars that fly at extremely high speeds and are very,very,very,VERY big. They are also highly explosive, more explosive than antimatter. If one hits something the size of our universe, it is completely vaporized into purple steam.
The poiple tyangle has only been observed 197 times since it was created.
The poiple tyangle is so far away from 99% of the stuff on this wiki that it can only be observed in
The SUS
.
It is surrounded by a gigantic void with no particles at all in it.
