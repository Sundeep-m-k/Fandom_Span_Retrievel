A polygon is a 2D shape that obeys these rules:
It must have 0+ sides
It must have line segments as edges
It must be closed
It must not have any shapes in shapes
It must not have any cross-overs
It's sides must be straight and not curved.
An example of this is a
square
. It has an area of
l
2
{\displaystyle l^2}
and each side is equal.
Some exotic polygons, such as the
henagon
and the
digon
, do not obey the above rules. However, they only exist properly in non-euclidean geometries, and are hence not usually counted among the real polygons.
Other name of polygon is Polysquaron. (By Googleaarex)

Henagon
[
]
A
henagon
is a polygon that has 1
edge
. In Euclidean geometry, this is impossible, because one edge extends to infinity. However, in spherical geometry, you can draw a henagon by drawing a
point
on the edge of a
circle
. It has a
Schläfli symbol
of as a henagon has only 1 edge and only 1
angle
.
Digon
[
]
A
digon
is a polygon with two edges. It is degenerate in normal euclidean space, though in some geometries, such as on the surface of a
sphere
, it can exist.
Draw two points on a
sphere
. Then, draw a
line
going from the first point to the second, then continuing around the sphere back to the first. This act puts two vertices on the surface of the sphere, two edges, and divides the sphere into two sections - the "inside" and "outside" of the digon.

Pentagon
[

A
pentagon
is a 5-sided polygon.
The structure of a pentagon will be described through the order in which the vertices are connected.
A regular
pentagon
is the most commonly encountered type. It has edges in the pattern 12345.
A
star
pentagon (also known as a
pentagram
) is the simplest star polygon. Its edges are in the pattern 13524.

Hendecagon
[
]
A hendecagon is a polygon with 11 sides and 11 straight edges, it's internal angle is 147.273 degrees.
The Canadian dollar coin, the loonie, is similar to, but not exactly, a regular hendecagonal prism.
The cross section of a loonie is a Reuleaux hendecagon.
Dodecagon
[
]
A dodecagon is a polygon with 12 sides, it's internal angle is 150 degrees.
Archimedes approxmated pi with a dodecagon, along with a hexagon, icositetragon, tetracontaoctagon and enneacontahexagon.
Icosagon
[
]
An
Icosagon
is a polygon with 20 sides and 20 edges, it's internal angle is 162 degrees.
A Hectogon
Hectogon
[
]
A hectogon, or hectagon, is a polygon with 100 sides, one internal angle of a hectogon is 176.4 degrees.
It is almost indistinguishable from a circle unless viewed closely.
Chilliagon
[
]
A chilliagon is a polygon with 1,000 sides, it looks like a circle, it's most common number for it is white.
Chilliagon
Myriagon
[
]
A
myriagon
is a polygon with 10,000 sides, it has a Schläfli symbol
{

{\displaystyle \{10^4\}}
, one internal angle = 179.964 degrees.
It is not visually distinguishable from a circle and the perimeter differs from circumference of a circle by 40 parts per billion.
Like the Chiliagon illustrated by Rene Descartes, the Myriagon has been used as an illustration of a well-defined concept that cannot be imagined.

Megagon
[
]
A
megagon
is a polygon with 1,000,000 sides. It has a Schläfli symbol
{
10
6
}
{\displaystyle \{10^6\}}
.
To an unaided observer, it resembles a circle, a megagon with a radius equal to that of
Earth
's equatorial radius means each side would be 40.075 meters long and it's perimeter would differ from the circumference of a circle by only 1/16 mm.
Gigagon
[
]
A
gigagon
is a two-dimensional polygon with one billion sides. It has the Schläfli symbol

10
9
}

edge length
differ from a circle by only 9.78 cm.

If a googolgon was drawn to 1e+27 times the radius of the observable universe, it would differ from a circle by a Planck length.
Googolplexgon
[
]
A
googolplexagon
is a polygon with googolplex sides, it is the largest finite number of sides measured on a polygon, and if drawn to 1e+27 times the radius of the observable universe, it would differ from a circle by 1 googol of a Planck length.
