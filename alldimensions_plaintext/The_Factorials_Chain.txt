The Factorials Chain
The Octosexagintitricenti-factorial, the 368th verse in the series. The purple dots are clusters of Septisexagintitricenti-factorials.
Scale
Size
The Uni-factorial is
!Ã∂
x!x
where x is the size of the biggest verse within the Uni-factorial in light years. The X-factorial is the same equation, but x is instead the size of the biggest X-1-factorial within the X-factorial.
EUSI
probably some big number
Dimensionality
Same as the size, but with 's dimensionality instead.
Kardashev Scale
Same as the size, but with 's Kardashev Scale instead.
Properties
Temperature
x!K, where x has the same definition in life percentage.
Class
24
Life Percentage
1/x!, where x is defined as the number of the verse in The Factorials Hierarchy you are currently in. (The Uni-factorial would be 1, so 1/1! ->  1/1 -> 100%, the Du-factorial would be 2, so 1/2! -> 1/2*1 -> 1/2 -> 50%, etc)
Shape
Always something with exclamation marks

The
Factorials Chain
(TFC) is a
class 24
chain
which has many factorial-related verses. The chain is infinitely long, with a lower bound of the amount of verses being
!Ã∂
200
. The verses themselves have qualities which are usually related to factorials, exclamation points, or both.
Other than those qualities, the Factorials Chain is a relatively uneventful chain when it comes to verses. The Factorials Chain also has some factorial-related effects, which only occur when directly in a verse in the Factorials Chain:
Factorials chain verse effects
[
]
Most of the effects listed are very trivial, and only found through over-specific testing of TFC verses.
Any civilization with living somewhere directly contained, not being contained themselves (eg planets) will usually come up with a base 6 (3!), 24 (4!), or 120 (5!) system.
When asked to name a random number in a certain range, one will always name a factorial number. If the range in question does not contain a factorial number, it will mysteriously not be asked, with no reason given.
If one is asked what their favorite mathematic operation is, they will say factorial, or some derivative.
