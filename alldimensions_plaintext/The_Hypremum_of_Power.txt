Taviverse
The Hypremum of Power is the first of the three
Hypremums
. These three verses are similar to the
Supremums
, however, instead of them relying on axioms, they will rely on proofs instead. This verse embodies all things to do with power, weakness, durability, intensity, and everything else inbetween and beyond. The Hypremum of Power basically governs everything, as everything has power within it.
The Hypremum of Power's size and dimensionality is measured via the use of the
O
n
{\displaystyle \mathcal{O_n}}
(
Order
) Function, and with the use of the constant
Ï„
{\displaystyle \mathcal{\tau}}
, the constant of totality.
This verse appears to be sapient and omniscient, and this verse is thought to be the most powerful being in existence. Any being more "powerful" than this verse is beyond power itself. This verse, despite all its power, is not arrogant, as it is so beyond emotions that it can't be. However, there is something far more insidious and destructive than this verse....
