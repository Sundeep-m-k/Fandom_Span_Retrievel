The
Radio Ring
is the 19th ring in the ring series.
It is actively used as a radio station, since all of the waves that come towards it get
strengthened, denoised and thrown back torwards the direction they came from.
The solid substance the
Radio Ring
is made out of will energize any wave that hits it.
This ring is habitzed, although, the laws of the
Radio Ring
affect the minds of the inhabitants into being highly isolatory
. Thus, any kind of society must be seperated into
sub-sub-groups of tiny sizes, each vaguely connected.
Note:
Do not attempt to fry the Radio Ring in a frying pan. Your elbows will turn into bulldozers. The reason why is because when the X-Ray gets fried, it will because INCREDIBLY Unstable and also INCREDIBLY glitchy, so much so, that it will be more glitchy than Absolute Glitch Matter, causing random things to happen, causing your elbows to turn into Bulldozers.
