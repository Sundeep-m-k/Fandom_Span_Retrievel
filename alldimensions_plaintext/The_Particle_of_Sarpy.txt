@
The Particle of Sarpy
form
{!}
: ???
Remember how the
Primordial
Is made of delta?
well uhh you will see something
THE GOD
In one in every 762 Googol
Boxes
is a sarpy Particle which will be represented with a @, it is extremely rarer than a ∆ particle and one of the  main differences between me and glitchy is that I actually know that a multiverse has more than a octillion particles, anyways Touching a @ is smart as NOT touching
glitchmatter
, because one @ makes you the powerful version of yourself and increases your stats beyond the max stats, and maximum potentence @ are what
sarpy
is fully made , thats why he(or me) is so powerful and @ is like strangematter but EVEN MORE PERFECT, stabler than stableness itself, more indestructible than durability, and doesn't spill out of the bottle when u drink(how cool)
And it regenerates! What more can u ask for?
