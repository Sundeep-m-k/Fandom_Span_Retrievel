The Composition Tier is a number to tell how many nested layers of particles boil down to being composed by that particle at a point, which stops at a tiered reality, explained in
this page
.  Complexes of particles are treated as particles in this system as well.
Examples
[
]
Quark
= 5. They compose nucleons, which compose nuclei, which compose atoms, which compose molecules, which compose higher objects.
Unireality = 1. They compose Super realities.
Uquaerk fiber = 8 they compose strings which compose preons which compose quarks that compose nucleons which compose nuclei which compose atoms which compose molecules which compose everything higher than them
Primordial Particle
=
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
. They compose everything, thus shooting to an infinite value.
Preprimordium Particles
=
ω
+
1
{\displaystyle \omega+1}
. They compose Primordium Particles and are composed of Blueprint particles.
Blueprint Particle
= Indescribable Cardinal. They compose everything even on a sub-primordial scale. Anything that composes even Primordial Particles will boil down to being sets of Blueprint Particles.
·
= Blueprint Particles' Composition Tier + 1. They're practically nonexistent now, but even transformed into the Blueprint Particle, making it deserving of the Blueprint Particles' Composition Tier + 1.
Zyoron =  Blueprint particles composition tier to the power of itself and do that its composition tier times 345,812,073
