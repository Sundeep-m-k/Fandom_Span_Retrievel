Picture of the Schiverse
The
Schiverse
(/sʃiːvəs/ UK or /sʃiːvɚs/ US) is a verse contained in
MILI-1
. It contains an ecosystem centered around Schions, an energy-carrying particle.

Structure
[
]
The Schiverse is 3D, has a diameter of 2 light-years, and it has the shape of a deltoidal icositetrahedron.
Schions
[
]
Schions
are a particle that carries energy. It is only able to exist within the laws of the Schiverse, and all life in the Schiverse uses them for energy.
Source
[
]
The main source of Schions are Schistars.
Schistars
[
]
Schistars are
stars
in the Schiverse that fuse matter into Schions, which they emit like normal stars emit photons. Schistars are born from matter collapsing in on itself due to gravity, and they die when there is no more matter to burn.
Gravity is weaker in the Schiverse, so stars are able to form but
planets
don't have enough gravity to form.
Life
[
]
Unlike on
Earth
and other planets, life on the Schiverse exists in the void instead of being grounded to a planetary body.

Schiplants
[
]
Schiplants are lifeforms that absorb schions. They reproduce by dispersing seeds from the yellow bit in the center.
Intelligent Life
[
]
The Schiverse has various intelligent lifeforms, but they're all relatively similar.
Schirean
[
]
long boi
Schireans are kind of the basic intelligent lifeform. They have a head with intelligence functions, a body and a schion container that gives them energy. Schireans can vary in body length. They use their arms to grab stuff like schiplants. Their mouth is at the top of their head (not shown in picture).
Schibrancher
[
]
Schibrancher
Schibranchers are similar to schireans, but they have lots of schireon containers. They can vary in body length and container amount. They also use their arms to grab stuff, and their mouth is at the top of their head.
Schimite
[
]
Schimites have a more protective shell around their schion container, which has a variable container of legs. They use these legs to grab food. Unlike other intelligent lifeforms, their mouth is at the bottom of their schion container.
Schefages
[
]
Schefage (from the top)
Schefages are beings which have holes at the top of their bodies. These bowl-shaped holes suck in schion containers from living beings and absorb all of their schions, effectively killing the beings (yeouch!!!!11). They have eyes to see, and limbs to move. what did you expect bro bro
Schidreadnought
[
]
A military vessel with a pulse laser and hypersonic missile with a shield called "deflector shield" is utilized by Schion, and reactor is schion, the armor is made of titanium, it's durable and Fast
This is a military vessel that has a Pulse laser that contains collimated lense providing no spread shooting
