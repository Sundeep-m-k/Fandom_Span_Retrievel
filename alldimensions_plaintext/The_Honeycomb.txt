The
Honeycomb
is a huge, flat structure that contains things like
The Infinite Infinity
and
The Point of No Return
. There are these hexagon-shaped things that rest on The Honeycomb called Reality Cells. They each contain one verse. There are no creatures that live on The Honeycomb itself.
The further you travel from the center of The Honeycomb, the more distorted things will get. If you travel far enough, the Reality Cells you see will begin to lose their hexagon shape. If you travel even more, the Reality Cells will begin to deform and even disappear.
At the center of The Honeycomb, there is an extremely powerful entity only known as the Puppet Master. It is thought that it controls every single Reality Cell. It lives in a huge Reality Cell. The huge Reality Cell is approximately 100002323810050139 times bigger than a normal Reality Cell.
