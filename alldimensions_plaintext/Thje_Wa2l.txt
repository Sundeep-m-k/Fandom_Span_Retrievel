Biggernoseverses
as well as several
ducks
, which were added to the
Existential Diary
with the object codes ψ06#0000, ψ55#814, ψ958#8888, and ψ00#003 in October 3, 1395. These ducks contain an infinite amount of other ducks,
including themselves
. Also, there used to be a 5th duck contained by
Thje Wa2l
with the object code ψ820#64.
The group of four ducks contained by
Thje Wa2l
, also known as the
Quackternion
are
sentient
, and there were multiple moments where they tried to kill each other, which could explain the dissappearance of the 5th duck.
The Quackternion also guard
Thje Wa2l
, despite them being a gazillion times smaller than the latter.
