A Cat is an extremely powerfull entity that rules over The Couch. If you hug the Cat, it will love you and give you that cute smile. It is very cute*.
Cat's enemy is
Dogy
.
Dogy always hates it.
*and annoying to care for. it can scratch parts of
The Fried Egg
, causing existences to dissappear. It also reduces the number of parts of the fried egg where there is matter of multiple existance states at once by splitting matter into two pieces of matter with one existance state.
Dogy has tried to destroy Cat before. Dogy sent Cat into
The Glitch Space
once, and trapped Cat there for 100 octillion years before Cat escaped.
