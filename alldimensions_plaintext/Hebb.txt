Hebbs
are yet another unimaginably tiny verses. Like
Heaas
, they're extremely hard to observe. Only 5 Hebbs in our local
Box
have been closely observed, with only one image of them existing on it. More Hebbs exist than Heaas, though lots of them are found outside of Heaas.
Hebbs seem to have trillions of tiny, glowing dots in them, with them all varying in color and size. Further research has been completed, but it was difficult, due how hard it is to contain Hebbs.
Due to recent technology invented in a different
Absoverse
, studies have been made on what the dots are, and it turns out, that these are extremely small
entities
, and the Hebbs they live on are like enourmous
planets
to them. Some Hebbs have been observed with the same civilization on both, which means
these micro-people
are incredibly advanced in some instances. These beings are still being studied in depth.
In an experiment, 2 Hebbs were made to collide into each other at high speeds. This caused an explosion about 1 μm in diameter, which is much bigger than the Hebbs themselves. It is likely that this event happens all the time, but is rarely noticed due to their miniscule size.
