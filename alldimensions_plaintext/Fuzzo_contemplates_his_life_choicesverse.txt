This verse is a restricted zone, so anybody who enters it will get torn apart. This verse is just a void and has a big brain in it. This brain’s quarks are TBHIHNI. This immortal brain seems to be losing it’s sanity and also has ridiculous power, being able to control the hierarchy below this with it’s mind... wait, it IS a mind.
More about the brain
[
]
The brain is the only object here, and it can communicate with you through your brain. It usually doesn’t talk unless you ask it, and it seems to be going insane for some reason. It’s personality doesn’t really exist, it just talks but with more going insane. It seems to be infinitely smarter than any entity below it in the hierarchy, even ones with just barely less power.
What else aside from the brain?

It’s just a white void, but it does have a few very rare black spots that are the same except a different color. They never go to the outside of this verse.
