Appearance
[
]
The Fractaverse has a blue, black and purple look with some weird membrane floating around. The Fractalverses have a weird animal cell looking appearance.
Accessing
[
]
To access the Fractaverse you need to travel into Beca-244-123's black hole in the center located in the
Becaverse
. Once accessed you appear looking at an infinite tunnel with Fractalverses on all of the sides. Since the Fractaverse is very cold (-10^32) you need a special space suit or rocket ship to withstand the cold temperature.
Sections
[
]
There are at least 2 quadrillion sections in the Fractaverse each section leading to a different part of the Fractaverse.
Fractalverses
[
]
There is an unknown number of Fractal-verses. We have discovered at least 2 sextillion Fractal-verses, which is 6% of the Fractaverse. All Fractal-verses do not change in appearance, and they do not glitch out like the
Realm of Dyaverses
does.
Life
[
]
Forms of life are unknown because the life inside of the Fractal-verse because of the extremely cold temperatures outside the fractal-verses. Because of an illusion of the Fractal-verses being very close to you, they are actually a few million light years away from you.
Glitches
[
]
The glitchy Fractaverse.
Glitches are very rare occurrence the chance of it happening is 0.000001% when it happens you will be greeted to a pink and yellow colored area. All of the Fractalverses are also pink and yellow, and the middle part of each segment is blue instead of black. The glitched part is also very hot (10^32) you would also die in 1 millisecond.
Escaping the Glitch
[
]
There is a 10% to be teleported back to the normal Fractaverse this is near impossible thought because you would die in 1 millisecond.
