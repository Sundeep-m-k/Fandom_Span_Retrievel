A Macroformer is a type of technology used to change the physics of a certain reality, container, or verse. How long it would take varies by technology, amount of macroformers used, and what layers they are deployed in. Layers is the same as EUSI, how deep a verse nestation is. So a lower layer of a macroformer would be a low EUSI verse, like a gigaverse or teraverse. A verse's physics change can harm or kill inhabitants depending on the speed of the change and how drastic it is. For example, take pysics 1 and physics 2, very similar and nearly the same in almost every law. A physics 1 macroformer with the speed at max turns a Phys. 2 verse into a 1 verse, and the inhabitants are hardly affected. Physics 1 macroformer does the same to physics 67485 universe, and all the inhabitants turn into goo squirrels due to the unrelatedness of the physical laws between 1 and 67485. If the physics of a verse is changed slowly over many eons, then its inhabitants would evolve to fit these physics, along with anything else physics-based they used. Macroformers are sometimes used to cleanse populations in not-so-nice empires, intentionally killing inhabitants.
A macroformer can be any size, which affects the layers mentioned before. Macroformer A is a universe large and converts a whole multiverse, while B is a multiverse big and converts a whole megaverse. They get done in the same amount of time, but B is more effective due to the larger size and its physics seeping into lower EUSI verses. Many empires hire private Macroformer companies to do work for them as well, interestingly.
