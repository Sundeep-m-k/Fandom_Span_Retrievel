Structure
[
]
This verse's outside is 2D, but despite this, the interior of the Sonji Triangle is 4D. The Sonji Triangle contains no layers. The reason it is a triangle is because the gravity is triangular. This type of gravity is known as irregular gravity, as it is gravity that doesn't create hydrostatic equilibrium.
Design
[
]
The Sonja Triangle used to have collision, and a currently unknown enitity decided to paint a smiley face on it. A massive shake in reality happened some time after the smiley face was painted, which caused the Sonji Triangle to glitch and lose its collision, so no one else could paint on it or destroy the paint. Therefore, the smiley face is stuck on the Sonji Triangle forever.
