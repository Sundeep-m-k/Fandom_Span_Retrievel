The
Globes
are large globe-like structures that contain
Cups
, and they're the first objects of the
Giganta's Class
. They're made out of an unknown type of liquid which is blastproof too. Some Globes were made by an unknown type of
god
. Even if a Globe breaks, it will soon be replaced.
The Globes are said to be colder than Absolute 0, and it's pressure outside of the areas where Cups are located at can crush you in a quarter of a
voidsecond
. The south of the Globes are usually the weakest parts, but it's even more impossible to enter them than the middle.
You can't hear anything either. Not even your heartbeat. That's because inside the Globe, it is -950K decibels.
