Brainrot parasite

Brainrot parasites
are parasites that plague various
beings
and contain a special type of fungus, specifically the
Brainrot fungi
, whom they have formed a symbiotic relationship with. Like all parasites, they have a gland that produces inhibitory chemicals to calm down the immune system of their hosts.
They have multiple different forms that specialize in parasitizing different beings,
humans
, etc. These parasites are everywhere, in different universes, planets, and stuff, the only place they do not appear is in
Real life
(and anything above it), the
backrooms
and the
frontrooms
. They can be tamed, but being able to do so is both very rare and difficult. The fungus comes out of the hole in their "head".
Right now, the brainrot parasite kills around
3,674
beings every second, with the number increasing all the time. The strongest beings they can kill usually are around
planetary
level.
Reproduction
[
]
This parasite uses asexual reproduction due to the fact that 2 parasites inside of a being's body would kill it instantly, so instead they just get into their digestive system, lays eggs that hatch in poop and then they fly with wings that they have to find new beings to parasitize and burrow in while cultivating the fungus inside it's body.
Forms
[
]
There are 3 types of brainrot parasite each specializing in parasitizing different beings.
Type 1
[
]
Type 1 parasites range in size from 1µm-100µm. They specialize in parasitizing bacteria and other small organisms. They are not particularly dangerous, because bacteria regenerate fast and they can't infect bigger things at a large scale.
Type 2
[
]
Type 2 parasites range in size from 100µm-1mm. They specialize in infecting beings such as insects, small rodents and similar. They can cause a mild infection in larger beings, usually presenting with a fever and other cold like symptoms. Like the common cold, it usually goes away in a few days and 90% of colds are actually caused by this parasite.
Type 3
[
]
Type 3 parasites range in size from 1mm-1cm, and specialize in infecting large entities. They disguise themselves using the same mechanism octopuses use to change their color. For most beings, symptoms usually progress quickly, with fever, seizures, delirium, meningitis, fibrosis of the lungs, encephalitis and necrotic areas of the bowel and heart with death occurring in a mere 2 hours.
For humans, they release Brainrot fungi into the patient's system, which ends up causing the patient to lose their intelligence, and become attracted to bright colors or images.
It also makes them say things like "tralalero tralala", "bombardiro crocodilo", "skibidi dop dop dop yes yes" or even "john pork jumbo josh brah" continuously. These symptoms can do their effect on humans of all ages, however, if the patient is untreated for a long time, they will start to have the same symptoms as the rest of species, and will die with a rotten purple brain that smells of spoiled meat.
If the parasite infects a patient in an
Universe
where the laws of physics allow respawning or reincarnation, the patient will be healthy but more aggressive than before and will have amnesia and only remember their name. They will also be transformed into tung tung tung sahur or one of the italian brainrot animals. This type of the parasite enjoys living inside mechanical structures, like TVs, phones, laptops, etc.
Origins
[
]
The true origin of Brainrot parasites is unknown, however, the most likely origin for their existence in our
Wikiverse
is that the parasite originates from an accident that took place 69 googol years ago, when the
Memer
accidentally created them, alongside the Brainrot fungi.
Cure (for humans)
[
]
There is no known cure, the only way to cure the patient is to limit their screen time, however, this isn't a perfect solution.
If the patient respawns or reincarnates, though, they will be immune to both the fungi and the parasite, but we cannot take their antibodies, due to the fact that the antibodies will weaken in the new host's body and would just be dissolved by the parasite into amino acids and proteins.
The
War
of the Parasites
[
]
The War of the Parasites is a war that was declared by the
LUA
on the parasites rather recently. They were infecting and reincarnating many people and aliens. The infected demonstrated intelligent use of firearms and tactics, even managing to hijack spacecraft to make bases on other planets. Almost all the details of this war are classified by the LUA so it will never happen again, so all we know is that the LUA somehow won and life reverted back to normal. This is all we can say about the war for now, though.
