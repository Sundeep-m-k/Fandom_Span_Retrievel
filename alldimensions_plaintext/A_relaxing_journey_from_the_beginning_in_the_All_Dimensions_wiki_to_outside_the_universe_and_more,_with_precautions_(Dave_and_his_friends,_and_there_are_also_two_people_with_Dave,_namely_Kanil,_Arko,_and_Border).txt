‚ÄúWhy did you enter here, user? You will not continue reading this page until you are over 65 years old. I am just joking that after the concept of a year, after the concept of time, all of eternity, and every single end and one beginning, there is no going back for you. If you enter the page, you will remain here forever. There is more. Discover it in this exciting adventure!‚Äù
The journey begins in an unknown white void with one character lost in this void, namely Kanil. Kanil does not realize anything around him, he only sees a white void, and this being, Kanil, says: Where am I? No sound or answer was heard for a long time and after 176 OYC he saw an indistinct being that seemed to be black as vapor and indistinct. At that moment, he fainted.
First vehicle
[
]
After he fainted, and before he woke up, Kanil heard a voice. He woke up and felt that they were Arko and Border and two new characters, Venis and Mitro. When Kanil opened his eyes, he saw himself in a spacious vehicle with a diameter of up to 40 meters, a narrow roof, and white walls. From the remnants of the white space we mentioned, those walls are stretched with strings forming squares, and those black strings are very thin, and in the entrance there is a glass door with the color blue on its side.
When Kanil woke up, he was shocked by a vacuum of beings that resemble humans, but in other dimensions, and they are four:
Venis:Who are you???
Arko: Let him speak comfortably
Border: Maybe we should get rid of him, guys
Kanil:WwWhaaat? NO NOüò∞! please don‚Äôt do it, iam peaceful!
Border: We must make sure to take him to the examination room. If he threatens us at all, he does not constitute a threat, but the examination room is necessary.
Kanil:  i dont understand, let me run please!
Venis: don‚Äôt speak
After they checked on him, they made sure that he was good, and they got to know his new name, and they got to know him, and he became their new friend, and now they drank a nice cup of coffee to prepare to go to the first nothingness and the first nothingness in the All Dimensions wiki, which is Absolute Nothing.
Explanation of words from the first chapter:
[
]
Border
is the driver of the vehicle and their leader.
The white void
was
Absolute truest nothing
Chapter 2
[
]
Arko: I feel bored
Mitro: look at the window, we arrived to
Absolute truest nothing
!
Border: I don't feel anything
Mitro: because it‚Äôs a nothingness void
What they see outside the window
Border: Well, we'll use this time to relax, Praise be to God, there is no entity or danger. This is what we should not think about
Mitro: We'll just enjoy looking out the windows
Border: We will increase speed
There is no fun or anything in this class, and the rest of the time they spend is boredom and nothing, just sitting and wondering what comes after this.
Chapter 3
[
]
Now they have reached Absolute Nothing. They thought they would achieve something, but they are tired of the empty spaces.
In this part, we find them talking about how they will spend their time as long as they are in that emptiness, but unfortunately they did not find any solution and they see the same thing they saw in the window: Absolute truest nothing, so this part is not important in the series.
Chapter 4
[
]
What Border see outside the window, he started coming out the Absolute nothing and he comes out of it, The Anti-THH is like a white glitch
Border: hey, we're about to get out of Absolute Nothing. I see the first light opposite the biggest thing on this block. I see a distant white dot outside the vehicle emitting light.
Kanil: The black color in Absolute Nothing started to become lighter as we moved out of it
Arko: Our goal is to go to
Big Chungus
who lives in
The E
Border: Who is this?
Arko: He's my friend. Before helping Kanil, I met a creature that said I was Big Chungus and he was black and I couldn't see him because there was no light or matter in Absolute true nothing.
Border: You don't know anything about him, he is a‚Ä¶
Kanil: Wait, we're getting to that point
In less than a nanosecond, Border replied, saying:We will die (Our body is used to spaces, not anti)
All Upgraded to an new level his body upgraded to an anti level
Chapter 5
[
]
His body in Anti Chain
When Border fell into Anti-
THH
, Anti-TSB and the rest of the Anti-Chain, his body changed and he was trapped in a disoriented glitch. His body was upgraded to Anti and his friends went and got lost in this glitch and he did not see them anymore, after his body reached Anti. Anti-
THE
entity saw and discussed the topic:
THE:I am evil, you must rid me of the opposite THE it‚Äôs me enemy, do this or i have erase you from the non-existence the non-existence is your original body, HAHAHAHA
His lost body in Anti-
THE
Border:now my body is an anti body, but the anti body plus the non-existence is an unified force
After killing Border THE, move to Truest Nothing
Chapter 6

All Chapters 6,7 and 8 seems like chapter 2 so there is no need to write it.
Chapter 7
[

All Chapters 6,7 and 8 seems like chapter 2 so there is no need to write it.
Chapter 8
[
]
Border is alone in
True Nothing (True)
. There is a small point of light that no one knows what it is, and we will discover that in Chapter 9.
It is mentioned that
True Nothing
is the smallest thing that can exist, be imagined, defined, written, clocked, listed, and more.absolutely nothing, no smaller things, no quantum weirdness. This is just pure true nothingness and nonexistence.
Border:Therefore, information is necessary before going to the place
Wondering
[
]
What if there is a type of bacteria the size of True Nothing that we and Smallians don't know about?.
Border: What if there was a type of bacteria the size of True Nothing (True)?ü§î

Chapter 9
[
]
After Border woke up from his dream, he realized that that dream was real while he was sleeping in the vehicle. The rest took care of him because they were worried about him, and what he dreamed was real because what he dreamed of was real and exists in the All Dimensions wiki.
Border: Maybe we should use this music it's good
Kanil: I have a better one:

Venis: I think this music is good and relaxing, good!
Border: Ok, we closes to the white point, or maybe we'll get out of it, I don't know

(Coming Soon‚Ä¶)
I did not write all the chapters in my notebook, so I started writing in my notebook from now, and I will imagine and narrate the stories that are now in the present. The important thing is the stories that came before it, I will try to write them, but with difficulty. The modern and present chapters I will write from now:
Chapter 554
[

Season 1
[
]
Travelling between realities
[
]
We are in the beginning of
The Omni-Omni
Oh I forgot we are now in
The Omni-Omni
this is bad and very boring, according to my information "The
Omni-Omni
is the last layer of the
Nested Reality
and contains everything that has the prefix "Omni". Dont confuse with the
Omniverse
. Surprisingly, life does exist here; It comes in the form of
Square beasts
,
Cube beasts
, and
Omni-Beasts
. Square beasts Are the weakest of the beasts, only controlling 0.000096% of the Omni-Omni. The Cube beasts Can control 0.02% of the Omni-Omni, and Omni-Beasts control 13.8% of the Omni-Omni. The rest of the 86.2% of the Omni-Omni is controlled by a singular creature. However, the creature has never taken an
Omni-Selfie
, so we don't have any clues about it. They are rumored to be called
The Omni-Omni-Omni
, though. There is nothing outside of the Omni-Omni as we know of yet, but some creatures HAVE tried to escape. For example, the Omni-Beasts created the first ever
Omni Class Spaceship
, meaning it can travel an entire
Omni-Universe
In one second. However, after 99,482,842,829 OYC's, the spaceship ran out of fuel. A few septillion Omni-Universes were traveled, and the lowest 17 layers of the
Nested Reality
were also exceeded. Somehow, it is contained by something. This thing is known as
The
.
The
is completely unknown at this time, and once a picture and any form of reliable info is made, the article will be posted." but the biggest fear is, are those Omni-Aliens still chasing me? Ok I forgot that my ship is a defeating robot,  We've gone beyond squares and squares of Nested Reality which is one square for us in Omni-Omni, and then we've gone beyond all the facts and existentials after that there's nothing interesting. Wait a minute the H

and  2/8 but that's no problem because the vehicle repairs itself. (Please I don‚Äôt know how to copy math formula)

The Omni-Omni life
[

It was a comfortable start for The Omni-Omni. I will turn on the radio to find out more about the life of The Omni-Omni:
Radio tape: [Glitched voice] Welcome to The Omni-Omni life Life here comes in all shapes and sizes,after we kÍô∞iÍô∞lÍô∞lÍô∞eÍô∞dÍô∞ your world   We were very happy about that!

[Disconnected]
What the hell did I hear? Did he really say universal murder? Did he mean
planet earth
or
planet xeno
üò±üíÄ not
Xeno planet
it‚Äôs my planet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't care about planet Earth because first if I go at the speed of light 300,000 km/s time will stop and if I go faster than that time will go backwards and planet Earth and everything will go backwards meaning the further you go beyond the speed of light time goes backwards meaning planet Earth doesn't exist and everything all dimensions and existences don't exist because I'm now going at 100,000,000Nested Realitty/Microsecond but I don't know if the Omni-Universe still exists or not, it doesn't matter.
This lone human returned to his vehicle, which is located in The Omni-Omni, and returned to his book and saw that Square beasts Are the weakest of the beasts, only controlling 0.000096% of the Omni-Omni. The Cube beasts can control 0.02% of the Omni-Omni, and Omni-Beasts control 13.8% of the Omni-Omni. The rest of the 86.2% of the Omni-Omni is controlled by a singular creature. However, the creature has never taken an Omni-Selfie, so we don't have any clues about it. They are rumored to be called The Omni-Omni-Omni, though.
The human‚Äôs journey through all the verses was filled with surreal encounters, each more mind-bending than the last. But nothing could have prepared them for what they were about to face: the
Square Beasts
, the
Cube Beasts
, and ultimately, the enigmatic
Omni-Omni-Omni
itself. the traveler stumbled upon the Square Beasts the weakest and most insignificant creatures in
the Omni-Omni
, controlling a mere 0.000096% of it. These beings were almost comical in their simplicity, each one a flat, two-dimensional shape that floated in the endless fractal expanse like pieces of discarded paper. They were harmless, barely more than fragments of the vast reality they existed within.
When the traveler saw a group of Square Beasts approaches him
But what the Square Beasts lacked in power, they made up for in their bizarre behavior. As the human approached, they began to vibrate erratically, flashing colors and shifting in and out of existence. Their presence seemed more like a glitch in reality than a true life form. Despite their weakness, they were not to be underestimated they had an unnerving ability to manipulate perception. The traveler felt their mind twist and warp, as though the boundaries of space and time were being altered around them.
The traveler managed to push through this disorienting effect, but the Square Beasts had left a mark.
Nested Reality
itself felt a little more fragile after the encounter, as if it could collapse at any moment.
Pressing on, the traveler soon encountered the Cube Beasts. These creatures were a significant step up in power, controlling 0.02% of
the Omni-Omni
. Unlike the chaotic, glitch-like Square Beasts, the Cube Beasts were far more structured and imposing. Each one was a perfect geometric cube, but their surfaces were covered in complex, ever-shifting patterns, like fractals that looped endlessly into smaller and smaller dimensions.
The traveler could sense the Cube Beasts raw strength they had control over entire portions of the Omni-Omni. When one of them shifted its focus to the human, it was like standing in front of a monumental force of nature. The air around the traveler became thick with pressure, as if gravity itself was bending under the Cube Beast‚Äôs control.
The encounter was not violent, but the traveler felt themselves examined by the Cube Beasts. Their minds seemed to probe, testing the limits of the human‚Äôs understanding of reality. It wasn‚Äôt painful, but it was overwhelming. The traveler could barely comprehend what was happening as layers of existence peeled away, revealing the dizzying complexity of the Omni-Omni. For a brief moment, the traveler saw the intricate web of universes that stretched across the Omni-Omni, each one nested within the other in a never-ending pattern.
The Cube Beasts didn‚Äôt speak, but somehow the traveler understood that they were being measured, weighed against the vastness of the Omni-Omni. And yet, the human passed through unscathed, as if the Cube Beasts had deemed them unworthy of further interest.
The Lost human says when he see The Omni-Omni-Omni:WTF is that creature?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?! RUUUUUUUUN!
After what felt like an eternity of wandering through the layers of the Omni-Omni, the traveler reached the heart of it all the domain of
The Omni-Omni-Omni
. This creature, rumored to control a staggering 86.2% of the Omni-Omni, was unlike anything the traveler had encountered before.
There was no form, no shape, no visible presence. The Omni-Omni-Omni was everywhere and nowhere at once, a force that transcended any physical manifestation. The traveler could feel its presence an all-encompassing awareness that stretched across every corner of the Omni-Omni. It was as if the entire reality was an extension of this being, and the traveler was a mere speck within its vast consciousness.
The human‚Äôs mind struggled to comprehend what they were experiencing. This was not a creature in the traditional sense it was the embodiment of the Omni-Omni itself. And yet, there was an intelligence behind it, a purpose that the human could barely grasp.
In that moment, the traveler understood why The Omni-Omni-Omni had never taken an
Omni-Selfie
it was not because it couldn‚Äôt, but because it didn‚Äôt need to. The concept of self, of individual identity, was meaningless to a being that spanned the entirety of the Omni-Omni.
The encounter was brief, but it left an indelible mark on the traveler‚Äôs mind. They had touched something beyond comprehension, something that existed outside the boundaries of life, time, and space. And yet, despite its overwhelming power, The Omni-Omni-Omni did nothing to harm the traveler. It simply was an eternal presence, observing the infinite layers of reality it controlled.
After meeting The Omni-Omni-Omni, the traveler felt small and insignificant, yet strangely enlightened. The journey through the Square Beasts, Cube Beasts, and finally to The Omni-Omni-Omni had expanded their understanding of existence, but it had also shattered many of their previous beliefs.
The Omni-Omni was not a place to conquer or explore in the traditional sense it was a realm of pure abstraction, a place where reality folded into itself endlessly. The traveler‚Äôs encounter with these beings had left them changed, with new knowledge and perspectives, but also with a deeper understanding of their own insignificance in the grand scheme of things.
The journey had been harrowing, confusing, and enlightening all at once. And as the traveler stood on the edge of the Omni-Omni, looking out into the infinite layers of
the
, he feels like he's standing on the last mountain of
The Omni-Omni
and the cold winds of victory are blowing in him and he sees above himself in the night sky all realities and
The
and everything following him in this wiki, I can't describe to you that fantastic and unexpected feeling , and they realized that this was only the beginning.
Their next step was unknown, but literally is The but no one know what follows he on

. one thing was certain: after experiencing the power of The Omni-Omni-Omni, nothing would ever be the same again.

I finally and with difficulty and fear I finally enter
The
!ü•µ
The Traveler speaks at difficulty and quickly:
Iam about to face
The
! the mysterious and bizarre entity!ü•µ ,described as controlling
the Omni-Omni
. According to legend,
The
appears underwhelming at first, but its nature and powers are far more dangerous than they seem.
Season 1 the entrance:
After the terrifying encounter with the Omni-Omni-Omni, the traveler believed that nothing could surprise them anymore. But deep within the layers of the Omni-Omni, they were wrong. As they traveled further, the ship‚Äôs new Omni-Energy connection began to flicker, as if reacting to something nearby. The ship was behaving erratically, and the traveler‚Äôs instruments showed strange, incomprehensible signals from ahead.
Suddenly, a sharp jolt rocked the ship. The traveler glanced at the controls. An unknown force had pulled them out of their path, and as they looked outside, they realized they had entered a different layer of reality. Everything looked... flat. Words floated in the space around them dozens of instances of the word ‚ÄúThe‚Äù, written in a plain, almost comically boring font.
The traveler‚Äôs heart raced. They had read about this place before. This was
THE the
, the home dimension of the infamous entity known as The.
A Battle of Wit (or the Lack Thereof):
Out of the swirling mass of "The" came a form indescribable, yet somehow familiar. The was there, and as legend foretold, its appearance was laughably unimpressive. The traveler remembered the description they had read: "A cross between a giant ape and a yelling nine-year-old you once saw at KFC."
Yet despite its ridiculous appearance, The wielded immense power. It controlled the Omni-Omni, and it could easily crush anything that dared to trespass in THE the.As The approached, it growled, extending massive claws from its form. The traveler knew what was coming. The was known for its tendency to attack intruders without reason. Only by passing an absurd test pronouncing "The" in a specific way‚Äîcould anyone hope to survive an encounter with the creature.
With the claws drawing closer, the traveler stood frozen, trying to remember how to say "The" correctly. But the pressure was too great, the fear too paralyzing. The claws struck but just before impact, something strange happened.
An hypothetical image of The
After that The stopped, its claws retracting as it stepped back. The traveler stared in disbelief. What had just happened? Had they survived by luck?
Then, a realization hit them. The, for all its power, wasn‚Äôt very bright. It didn‚Äôt attack simply because the traveler had failed the test, it had forgotten why it was attacking in the first place.
The traveler‚Äôs mind raced. This might be their only chance to escape. But how? The had grown bored, and now it stood, confused, muttering something incoherent to itself. Was there a way to outsmart the creature?
A spark of hope flared in the traveler‚Äôs mind. If The was as simple-minded as the legends said, perhaps there was a way to manipulate it. Quickly, the traveler began talking, making random statements about the Omni-Omni, complimenting The on its control over the universe. They threw in a few mispronunciations of ‚ÄúThe,‚Äù watching as The grew even more distracted. the traveler slowly backed toward their ship. As they reached the entrance, they whispered one last thing, pronouncing The in the exact way the creature needed to hear. The froze, processing the sound. Then, without warning, it turned and lumbered away, muttering something incomprehensible as it vanished into the endless layers of the Omni-Omni.
The Escape from THE the: The traveler wasted no time. They launched the ship at full speed, desperate to leave THE the and The behind. As they powered through the layers of the Omni-Omni, the ship‚Äôs systems finally stabilized. It seemed that even the Omni-Energy couldn‚Äôt handle The's bizarre presence for long.
Breathing a sigh of relief, the traveler checked their surroundings. For now, they were safe. But they knew better than to get comfortable. The wasn‚Äôt the only strange entity out there, and their journey through the Omni-Omni was far from over.
But for now, at least, they had escaped the mind-bending clutches of The and lived to tell the tale.

The Legendary battle

(Coming soon‚Ä¶)
Chapter 556
[
]
As the traveler‚Äôs journey continued deeper into the Omni-Omni, they stumbled upon something that defied all logic THE the. This was not merely The but a place so dense with ‚ÄúTHE‚Äù that it had its own rules, its own reality, and even its own Void. This layer was infinitely more complex, filled with anti-space to accommodate the vast emptiness and powerful forces within. It was as if the very concept of ‚ÄúTHE‚Äù had materialized, creating a land unlike anything the traveler had encountered.
Video of the photographer when he explored the vicinity of the Structure of gnihtyrevE, but unfortunately the photography does not seem clear.
Upon entering, the ship‚Äôs instruments went haywire, attempting to process the immense density of THE the. Here, matter was concentrated to an impossible degree, with existence states beyond normal comprehension. The traveler‚Äôs body felt an intense pressure from all sides, like being crushed by invisible hands. Even the atoms here seemed to have different properties, repelling objects that tried to interact with them.
Looking outside, the traveler noticed countless beings roaming the expanse of THE the inhabitants known simply as THEs. They were beings of pure THE intelligence, wielding a level of knowledge and understanding about THE Omni-Omni that dwarfed anything else in existence. These creatures appeared to function as a collective, all connected and holding within them some fragment of the Omni-Omni itself.
In the distance, a massive structure caught the traveler‚Äôs attention. It was THE Tower, a monumental construct built by the THEs to bridge different layers of reality, allowing them to explore the vast multiverse without being ‚Äútoo big‚Äù or ‚Äútoo small.‚Äù The sheer scale of THE Tower was overwhelming, reaching heights that defied reason, and its design seemed to twist and turn in ways that went beyond three-dimensional comprehension.
Alongside THE Tower was something even stranger The Structure of gnithyreVE. This enigmatic form seemed to contain everything that began with THE or The on a smaller scale than THE Tower. It was a place of profound secrets, containing pathways that connected various verses of the Omni-Omni and layers of THE the.
As the traveler moved closer, several THEs turned their attention toward the intruder. They floated toward the ship, radiating an aura of boundless knowledge. The traveler could feel their minds being probed, as if the THEs were assessing whether they were worthy of traversing this domain.
One of the THEs communicated through a series of vibrations and visual flashes, conveying that only those who could understand the true nature of ‚ÄúTHE‚Äù would be allowed to move freely. The traveler, unsure of how to respond, attempted to match the frequency of the vibrations using the ship‚Äôs communication system. Slowly, they began to understand fragments of the message.
The traveler hesitated but replied, ‚ÄúI seek to explore the Omni-Omni and uncover its secrets.‚Äù
Both of "The" Speak about the traveller behind  Structure of gnihtyrevE
The THEs seemed amused, if such beings could even feel amusement. They discussed among themselves, eventually deciding that the traveler could proceed but would be bound to certain rules. The traveler would not be allowed near THE Tower or the Structure of gnithyreVE without proving their understanding of THE the‚Äôs true nature.
The traveler continued deeper, constantly watched by the THEs. The ship‚Äôs sensors struggled to interpret the dimensions within THE the, which seemed to stretch across a googol-dimensional space, a concept that shattered conventional geometry.
As they ventured further, the traveler noticed pockets of ‚Äúmegametatemeters‚Äù‚Äîimmense spaces where sizes shifted unpredictably from double the largest known scales to fractions of microscopic proportions. Every step in THE the was a challenge, requiring the traveler to constantly adapt to the ever-shifting dimensions.
Finally, the traveler approached a boundary within THE the, beyond which lay the ultimate secret: a hidden chamber rumored to hold knowledge about The E and the origins of the Omni-Omni itself. But as they neared, a group of powerful THEs appeared, signaling that the traveler had gone as far as they would be permitted.
Realizing there was no way forward, the traveler respected the THEs‚Äô boundary and began the journey back to their ship, carrying with them an expanded understanding of THE the‚Äôs complex nature. They knew that this realm was unlike any other, a place where the very fabric of existence was manipulated by beings whose intelligence surpassed anything imaginable.
As they departed from THE the, the traveler glanced back one last time, the vast realm fading into the distance. They had seen only a fraction of its mysteries but were determined to uncover more of the Omni-Omni, even if it meant facing beings far more powerful than themselves.

An artist describe how THE the loops look like
After the Traveller exit
THE the
, it appears from him a circle surrounded by a black void, the traveler saw nothing only after a long time, the traveler did not specify the time but it was still useful information, after a long time, he began to see another circle like it from afar, he increased the speed to 1000000x the previous speed, he began to move quickly and the other THE the's moved with him, now a network emerged from THE the complex like no other, he had never seen anything like it before, even the networks became copies of THE the but bigger, he decided to increase the speed to double 10{100}10x so he shook and from the high speed he was going blind so he decided to close the window of the vehicle and the vehicle would take over and go on its own without a driver and the computer and screens would alert the traveler with a light ringing that he had exceeded the copies of THE the, after this the computer and the vehicle screens alerted him of this, so he opened the vehicle and saw a smaller copy of
The E
so the computer read it and told him the same thing would happen so he did the same thing. As the traveler approached The E barrier, he saw particles with negative force entering The E from the force of gravity, and it was from its red membrane, its color was red like him, the pressure was very large, as if he was in the middle of a Class Œ© Star, only when he exited The E last barrier did he encounter gravity that attracts things for only 1 yalmeon time, but the craft was stronger than that, its force was up to the strength of the Shithole level, and with that it did a great effort, because this was one of the most attractive signs in All Dimensions Wiki and this could be the most attractive sign, in the resistance where the craft slowly escaped, he noticed an object heading quickly towards the craft affected by The E‚Äôs gravity, the craft created a black hole like a portal, he entered it and it opened behind the craft, after hellish resistance, the gravity began to decrease little by little, the sound outside The E was very strong, more than 10,000 db and this sound came from its gravity from far away.

Nothing Vehicle White Squares (Increases in Size)
A fast car that goes to the road where two guards are standing in black and green (page will be created in the future) The car goes out on the hidden road and goes past the Earth, the solar system, the universe, the multiverse until it reaches The Light Beam.
In
The Light Beam
we will meet by chance with a human from
our planet
named Driss and his small ship and the windows are at a 180¬∞ angle and we drink
Earth
tea (which came from planet
Earth
) and the ship is moving at the speed of
The Light Beam
itself, look at the view the space light has arrived because
The Light Beam
is now in a bright area in the
Iautaultraverse
, we hugged well because there is one
Light Beam
in the
Iotaultraverse
and this was a miracle for us, if the
Light Beam
is one then we have exited our own
The Light Beam
, which is moving at the speed of

per googolplex years. Wow what a view!
Then we go back and buy a ship from
DeltaTech
and go with it until we reach
SHUB
In
SHUB
all the toilets explode but there is a ship that looks like a toilet it is only dirty from the outside and not eye-catching, there are beings in
SHUB
that cheat other beings in this way, appearances are deceiving, because that toilet is not a toilet at all it is just a cube of unknown origin hanging there which is estimated to be worth T.H.E F.I.N.A.L E.N.D.I.N.G dollar
