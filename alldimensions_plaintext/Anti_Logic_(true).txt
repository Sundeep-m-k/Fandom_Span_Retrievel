Anti Logic
is the idea of the most fundamental object that makes up everything that can only be. This is the lowest level of logic. If an object is smaller than Anti Logic while not being
true nothing
, then it will actually be bigger than Anti Logic, because this object must consist of Anti Logic, otherwise the idea is violated and it becomes a
false Anti Logic
instead. This logic applies to all
Antiverses
, as they are opposites of regular universes and is used in the creation of
Endometrium
.
Not much else is known about True Anti Logic though, so this is all we can write about them.

Anti Logic (true) is a super-void! That means it is a very big and empty void, having only 0.00000000000001% of its volume taken up by matter, and the 'matter' in it is just a very small amount of words, or just a single template. Fill in the super-void by

These objects are not smaller than elementary particles like the order would suggest. In reality, this chain diverges from the Astronomical Objects chain.
