Physics
[
]
The physics here is very different compared to universes like ours.
The electric charges have one more charges. Positive, negative, and posigative. If you dont get what posinegative means, its that things are attracted to eachother but repelled at the same time, so they are only attracted form a distance.
Gravitational acceleration is
0.8
m
s

{\displaystyle \frac{0.8m}{s^2}}
here.
Space is also different here. It is because the 3D parts in this realm have been combined with 4D part, making some of the parts of this realm 4D.
Time is wonky and weird here, because a high-mass object speeds up time. (small things dont slow time down it can only be sped up)

Mort
[
]
Mort is just light in this realm. It has a wavelength, just like light, which allows creatures/cells to see. It has an energy value, so plants can exist. Its also 1000x times smaller then a Rod. Morts can be relased if Rods are compressed 10x times, so stars can relase light. Mort is what creates Rods, Morts can be random in size and in energy value. Making the rods heavy or light and the energy value of the Morts make the Rods colorful.
Life
[
]
The life in this verse is a strange thing, since there are plasma insects, explosive floating potato creatures, Really long worms, and deadly wierd circular 6-headed bears with a head on each side as if it was a cube and legs all over. Let’s start with the insects. Basically, they eat very small sections and particles inside the Matot. The explosive floating potatoes are strange, but they disquise as other things and blow up when you eat them, dealing minor damage to most of this area. The really long worms burrow through things and eat small things and also attack the plasma insects to eat them since their immune system is good enough to withstand the dangerous hot plasma. The bears are the top of the food chain, eating plasma insects, potatoes, and the long worms. Nothing can compete as these are VERY large compared to the others, being about 20x as large as the worm.
Rods
[
]
Rods are what create Matots, its the building blocks of Matots and lifefroms. The rods can combine by electric charges too create ''atoms''. Because the rods carry out electrical signals, an organism can sence their inviorment. With these tools, simple brains and eyes can form. The max amount of rods in a Matot are 131, and the minimum is 2. And if a Matot is compressed the rods vibrate, and if you compress it too the point where the rods are ten times shorter, it will carry alot of energy that needs to be get rid of. So then, when an compressed Matot hits another compressed Matot it will release a huge amount of energy, then the rods break out and push the other Matots. And so the stars do not collapse.
Matot
[
]
Matots have 6 (or more) rods extending outwards from the center. Said rods decrease in the amount of energy overtime in a given Matot, leading to energy deficiency. Due to being "useless", the Matot that lacks energy is then disposed of. A Matots size is 1^e350 times smaller then a normal atom. Cells need energy in order to move, consume food, and multiply.
Cells
[
]
Cells of Matots can be as small as e^4 atoms. And the cells cant get to big because of: gravity, surface size, and mass. The cells just swim throughout various spaces by disposing of energy-lacking Matots. The cells use complex stuff to live and do other stuff.
Organisms made out of Matot cells can consume creatures inferior in size.
Multicellular Organisms
[
]
The multicellular organisms in this realm rely on creatures, floating Matots, and cells.
Here the multicellular organisms dont have to use waste for moveing, but for fecenateing. The organisms rely on tails, fins, and other stuff to move. Even smart creatures can form!
The multicellular organisms can vary in size. They can be e^8, or e^14 times bigger then cells.
