About

Neon Ash
is
the man of Fate
’s daughter. She is half-human, half-god. She is a scientist and she was born with an illness called M.I.A.M (which stands for “Murderous Instincts And Malice”) which affected her greatly, and she made it her goal to spread it everywhere. The way M.I.A.M spreads is if someone with M.I.A.M manipulates a victim to kill someone else, when the victim kills the someone else, that is the entrance to M.I.A.M and the victim will have it forever. And sometimes, someone is just born with M.I.A.M.
Lore
[
]
To spread M.I.A.M, she cloned herself 4 times, and tweaked their genetics so it wasn’t suspicious that they all looked the same. Her first clone was named Korku, the second Sen, the third Mina, the fourth Jennie. Neon wiped all of their memories and made them think they were normal people. She set them out into public and never saw them again. She grew insane, and forced some people in public to drink poison, and then drank poison herself.
