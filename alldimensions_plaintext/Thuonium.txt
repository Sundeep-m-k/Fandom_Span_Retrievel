About
[
]
Thuonium
is a
material
that is sometimes classified as an
element
. What makes it different from other elements is that its nucleus is composed of a
Connecticut Meson
and an
Oklahoma Meson
.
Normally, these two mesons would be very destabilized with each other, but the seven
thuons
present in the shell stabilize the nucleus.
History
[
]
Thuonium was first theorized to be able to exist in 2962 in a paper by Leonardo Turisi named "Possible new Elements formed by
Mutated
Mesons". The first Thuonium atom was created in 2985 at
MuiLabs
.
Uses
[
]
Thuonium is most commonly used for
sinyon
extraction. When a neutralized portion of a
Gridcube
is obtained, thuonium is injected into it, and it breaks down the bonds between the sinyons bringing them together and allowing them to be harvested.
