Fourteen
(
"Grob'bad"
in
The Pencil Language
or
Tedak
in Future English) is the 4th verse in the Eleven Chain. Weirdly enough, almost all of its properties have a value of 14, such as its size being
ω
14
{\displaystyle \omega_{14}}
, dimension being 14, life percentage being 14, etc. Due to this, Fourteen also contains itself.

Appearance
[
]
Fourteen appears to be a gigantic, black "14". The 2 numbers are disconnected, forming 2 separate sections of the verse.
Structure
[
]
Due to 14 being shaped as a literal 14 (with 4 being the open form), it has 2 parts, the 1 and the 4.
The 1
[
]
The 1 section contains 14
Thirteens
inside of it. The Thirteens are placed in a very orderly fashion, and rarely, if ever collide with each other.
The 4
[
]
The 4 is a much weirder structure than The 1. The 4 seems to be a sentient creature, with it being seen moving or even communicating before. The 4 has many powers, with a few of them being shooting energy beams, screeching, mutilating creatures, and recovering creatures.
Other
[

There has been reports of a strange object flying around 14. this object, when talked to, will always burst out, "YO WELCOME BACK TO ANOTHER VIDEO AND-" or "like and subscribe or-". This creature is extremely weird, and seems to know about the
1V1 NOOB SKEPPY MINECRAFT OMG NOT FAKEverse
quite well.
