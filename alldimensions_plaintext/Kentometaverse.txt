The
Kentometaverse
is an exceptionally unstable simulation, prone to errors, glitches, and the like that may sometimes cause random veins of
Glitchonicite
ranging from the size of a
Universe
to that of
The Box
. It contains hypercomputers that contain the data pertaining to the Kentomultiverses.
by the way, the basement is actually so cruel that the systematization has not been completed and now the time dimensions there are completely unstable. But this is only an exception

The Center
[
]
The Center, is, well, the center of the Kentometaverse. Our local Kentomultiverse is situated here. It is surrounded by an extremely luminous
Lockverse
, which serves as kind of the
sun
, but at a much, much larger scale.
The Terminals
[
]
Right outside The Center are the Seven Terminals, which contain the hypercomputers responsible for running half of the Kentomultiverses. They are all shaped after a truncated icosahedron, and they are made of
Terminium
, an electoconductive and extremely durable material, designed after
Alphasm
's neural connections. They are connected by a thin wire, as wide as a Universe, made from
Primordium Alpha
.
The Compute Shaders
[
]
The Compute Shaders usually orbit one of The Seven, and are responsible for 25% of the Kentomultiverse simulations. Their shape is incomprehensibly complex, and changes once every Urqaek second, which is due to the fact that they're made from Glitchonicite mined from the earlier mentioned veins.
The Arms
[
]
The Arms are made out of matter ejected from the instability of the contained Kentomultiverses, and as such, are often a cocktail of different elements, alloys, and materials that the unknown inhabitants of this verse mines for use for expanding their simulation.
