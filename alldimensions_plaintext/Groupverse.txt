The
Groupverse
is a verse that contains every possible group, in Group Theory, in every dimension where it applies. Each of these groups are made of 1D axial dimensions, but the structures are still visible because the axioms vibrate in all 3

dimensions. Every dimension in the
Groupverse
is connected through wormholes. This verse is contained by
The Box
, and every Box contains at least one of these verses. The reason it's Complexity is uncountably infinite is because there are so many groups that they transcend alpha null. This verse essentially acts as the source of abstract algebraic logic in a Box, because it's constantly radiating self-replicating
Blueprint Particles
in every dimension at beyond absolute speeds (this is only a theory). Every
Groupverse
possesses an
Angustiverse
at it's center.
Structure
[
]
The
Groupverse's
structure heavily involves fractals due to the nature of it's mathematical properties. In Group Theory, every
Real Domain
group has an infinite amount of combinations. These symmetric combinations manifest as never-ending fractals in an analog gradient. The appearance of these Groups isn't always infinite, most only having a finite amount of elements with the image below being an example. The energy that makes up the
Groupverse
isn't tangible because it doesn't have any matter that makes it up (other than the photons released), but simply being what is released by the axial dimension's vibrations.
The
Groupverse
is made up of two things: Subgroups and Supergroups. These structures make the appearance of this verse look like a fractal ranging in shape, and are connected interdimensionally, Which means if you were teleported into the
Groupverse,
you wouldn't be able to see the entire structure. The color of a group is determined by how many combinations there are. Groups or subgroups of it that have fewer combinations are more red, and ones with greater combinations are more blue or violet.
