A Google Translateverse, usually shortened to "GTverse", is a type of verse which has its information corrupted and changed through a special program known as "Google Translate". Any verse can be turned into a Google Translateverse.
The Google Translate Program
[
]
The Google Translate Program is a very complicated and elusive program developed by beings outside of the AD cosmology, making it completely unknown to anything inside of the wiki. This program translates information through many different alien languages.
Due to how different languages have different structures and words that might mean something else in another language, if you take some words/sentences in Language A and translate it to Language B, then Language C, etc. and back to Language A, the meaning will be different.
The more you continue this translation cycle, the more corrupted and messed up the original verse will be.
