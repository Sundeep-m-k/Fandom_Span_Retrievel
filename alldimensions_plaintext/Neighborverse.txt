The
Neighborverse
is a
verse
that has been rarely encountered while attempting to traverse
the unknown of unknown
. The amount of Neighborverses in the unknown of unknown is believed to be 1, but there is no current way of determining this. Once a ship has entered within detectable range of the Neighborverse, it is physically unable to leave the area until it enters the Neighborverse.

Neighborverse residences
[
]
The Neighborverse contains a large, transparent spherical barrier ~2km in radius that surrounds the viewer's
neighborverse residence
. The neighborverse residence of a person will always be an exact copy of an adjacent home to their childhood residence (their neighbors, usually). If this adjacent home was within a group of houses (e.g. an apartment complex), the copy will contain only that residence detached from the rest of the building.
Everyone views the Neighborverse differently and so multiple people looking at the Neighborverse will see different houses within the barrier. The choice of neighborverse residence seems to be randomly chosen out of all possible adjacent homes, however once chosen only that residence will be seen by a person and will never change to another house.
It is unknown how the Neighborverse determines neighborverse residences. Some people have theorized that the Neighborverse somehow analyses the memory of nearby people to find their neighborverse residence, but there are currently no known ways of proving this scientifically.
Photography
[
]
Taking a photo of the Neighborverse will show the neighborverse residence of the nearest person inside. The reason why or how this happens is also unknown. Currently no unmanned probes have been able to encounter the Neighborverse and take a photo of it to try and see what happens when no people are nearby.
Entrance
[

Although it may look solid, the barrier of the Neighborverse does not physically interact with any known matter and can be passed through. However, when a person interacts with the barrier they are seperated from the rest of their group and ship and are find themselves suddenly right outside their neighborverse residence.
The residents of the visitor's neighborverse residence can be seen doing daily activities within the residence. The residents will not interact or talk with the visitor and will act like they cannot view or hear them, and the actions the residents take will loop periodically after a day. The residents will also pass through the person if they get in the way. For these reasons the residents of neighborverse residences are believed to be a sort of 'projection' of real people, and not actually real.
Do not attempt to interact with the residents more than 212 times in a day.
Neuritis
[
]
Spending extended periods of time within the Neighborverse (more than 2 weeks) has resulted in symptoms of neuritis (the inflammation of nerve cells) within visitors. Once the neighborverse has been exited these problems seem to heal quickly (usually over the course of an hour), although it is recommended to leave the Neighborverse if you begin to feel either of the following symptoms:
Constant slight pain near nerves
Abnormal difficulty of movement
Exit
[
]
Once inside the Neighborverse, exiting is simple by just touching the barrier again from inside. Once this happens, the visitor will suddenly find themselves transported to their ship in the same location that they left at, however they will now be in the
Neighborhood
. Multiple people exiting the Neighborverse find themselves in the same ship and can interact with each other again. Entering a Neighborverse from the Neighborhood and exiting will still result in being in the Neighborhood.
It is unknown how ships are transported into the Neighborverse. Looking at onboard cameras shows that the ship seems to be transported the moment it touches the barrier of the Neighborverse, or if the ship does not directly touch the barrier it will be transported when the first visitor leaves. Objects other than ships (such as rods of metal, pencils, plants, etc.) also follow the same properties.
It has been theorized that the Neighborverse found in the unknown of unknown is actually a 'portal' to the Neighborverses found in the Neighborhood, because transportation into the Neighborhood is only one-way.
