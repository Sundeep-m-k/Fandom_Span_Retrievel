Hyperenergization
(British English: Hyperenergisation)
is the process of bombarding an atom with ridiculous amounts of atomic energy. Hyperenergisation typically changes the properties of an element, generally making it more reactive.
Hyperenergisation Levels
[
]
There are various levels of hyperenergization which make atoms have different properties. The hyperenergisation level increases with the amount of atomic energy that is given to the atom.
Chemical Notation
[
]
Hypernergisation is labeled in chemical formulas as
hE
. If the hypernergization level is higher than 1, then it will be notated next to the hE in roman numerals, for example II-hyperenergisation is notated as
hEII
.
Example of a real molecule (Bronzecarbite-hEIV):
CoSn
hEIV
C
9
{\displaystyle {\ce {CoSn^{hEIV}C9}}}

Normally, materials are run through hyperenergisers for singular hyperenergisation. These machines use a generator to convert regular energy to atomic energy, which is then put into a bombarder which beams the energy to an input material.
To obtain higher hyperenergisation levels, it is required that the material is run through a hyperenergisation chain.
