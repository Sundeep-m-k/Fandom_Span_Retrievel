Below are some types of entities present in the North-Koreaverse.
Grapes

Grapes take up 70% of the population. They are widely seen in the outer layers of the verse inside labor camps, which are mostly planets and asteroids. Grapes have no right to reason and only exist to work and suffer. Any grape that rebels against the system is never seen again.
Apples

28% of the population consists of apples. Apples are distributed less evenly across the verse than grapes and can be seen in jails and prisons, stellar-sized structures which don't allow beings to leave. Apples that are outside of jails and prisons have rights to only few and very small opinions compared to tomatoes.
Tomatoes

Tomatoes are the remaining 2% of the population. Tomatoes are nearly always seen near the central galaxy of the universe, with the name of 평양. They all follow the same religion and ideology, and have a moderately high level of allowed opinions.
