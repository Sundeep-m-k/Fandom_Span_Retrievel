The ITS ITME TO STOPVERSE is a be-all end-all terminator and if any universe grows bigger than the ITS TIME TO STOPVERSE, the universe shrinks to the size smaller than a

The ITS TIME TO STOPVERSE is some bright red but only because it is filled with actually red particles instead of the transparent ones most universes has, when you go outside as seen in the picture it looks like a person holding a clock

then the dimensionality is
α

4
i
d
{\displaystyle \alpha \times 4i ^d}
alpha being the existence value of the observer and d is the dimensionality of the observer.
For example humans would see 4 normal dimensions.
AIENTERN would see -20 imaginary dimensions
sentient positrons would see
