A
Liverse
is a universe with bubble spheres that contain air and other things needed for life to develop, with some having underwater plants and sponges and worms, but others only having algae and fish. When the bubble spheres collide, they move into each other. During that time, they collide like universes would, and they keep moving until they turn into one. When they turn into one, they release a giant amount of energy.
