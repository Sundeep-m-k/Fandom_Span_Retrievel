The Virtual Box
is the biggest expansion for the Cosmic Virtual Realm, with its biggest structure being
The Cubed Virtual Machine
. It simulates everything bellow it, while having multiple layers, just like
The Box
.
It is self-contained for and it is virtually impossible to even reach TVB. I
It can also simulate the previous Virtual Realms and some "End All-Be-alls", which are false ends. But, there's a catch...
The False "Ends" Simulation API
[
]
They are simulated like really resistant bubbles that CAN be surpassed by special equipment, thus allowing really advanced civilizations to see what's beyond one, while also allowing them to proceed to the next structure.
The World Generation API
[
]
Every time a undiscovered ocation is loaded, it is generated by using the Seed to properly load the terrain. Different
The Virtual Machines
use different seeds to generate the terrain. (This Only Affects
TVMs
generated within
The Virtual Box
. If a
The Cubed Virtual Machine
Is directly contained by
The true host
, it has a low probability of using them. )
What are seeds?
[
]
Seeds are just 16-digit numbers that tells the algorithm how to generate the simulation with the necessary amount of noise/terrain distribution. They're not required, but important for proper TVM Generation inside the
TVB
.
