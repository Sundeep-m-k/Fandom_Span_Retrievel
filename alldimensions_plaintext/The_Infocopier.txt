Scale
Size
Can grow to whatever size Alphasm tells it to, default size is 1/1,000,000 of The Core of Everything if Alphasm tells it to “switch to default size”. Alphasm also can change the default size at will.

Position

The Core of Everything
The Infocopier is a special part of
The Core of Everything
used to copy all information of any verse at any point in time. The Infocopier has been used to "time-freeze" verses and has given many civilizations valuable information.
Structure
[
]
The Infocopier has a fractal structure, with each layer processing a specific property of the verse that it is copying the information from. A singularity at the center of this fractal stores the actual information.
The Singularity
[
]
The Singularity, being a Singularity, has all the properties of a Singularity. If you go inside it without the effects of a singularity stopping you (spacetime is gone near it because it has the same properties as a black hole because black holes are singularities), you will be teleported to a random location outside of The Core of Everything but inside Alphasm’s mind. It won’t teleport you anywhere dangerous.
Process
[
]
The Infocopier, in order to copy a verse's information at a given point in time, has to go through a process.
Here are the steps:
The Infocopier will find a verse to copy.
The Infocopier will lock the verse at a specific time coordinate.
The Infocopier will then copy all of its attributes in each layer of its fractal structure.
The Infocopier will then store all of these properties at its center, in which it then can display all of this information in digital or physical format.
