OMNI WIP, insanely WIP, yeah you get the point...
The Collection of Realms is a verse full of realms. It has a certain system for all of its realms. There are 3 letters. The last letter is the realm. The letters are A-H, so there are 8 realms in every collection. The second number is the collection number. It works exactly like the last number, but instead of saying the realm, it says the realm collection. The first number is the realm collection collection. Do I really need to explain how this one works? That kind of makes The Collection of Realms a realm collection collection collection. The Collection of Realms has LOTS of space between realms. The space is made of an indescribable matter.
its not all collection. Its most popular collection from  fifth everything layer. In bigger layers- no. Its mean for TOG is no name collections of realms.
A- collection of first realms
b-collections of second reaalms
c-collection of fourth realms and etc.
AAC- its 2/3 second realm and 1/3 third realm.
AAA its fusion of three first realms

AB
A
[
]
A is the first and largest realm collection collection in The Collection of Realms. It is a giant sphere that is very easy to escape. All you have to do is, well, go through it. You immediately will if you walk into it. It has many different realm collections in it, each having many different realms.
AA
[
]
AA is the largest realm collection in A. It has many different realms. Just like A, it is very easy to escape. It is a giant cube.
AAA - The Omni Realm
[
]
AAA is a realm full of stuff. It is the largest realm in AA (no surprise here) and contains all verses and stuff that exist. It is made of chains of particles known as `~/*;:'",./s.
`~/*;:'",./
[
]
`~/*;:'",./s are particles that make up AAA. They are infinitely smaller than
Blueprint Particles
. They have no properties, not even the property of having no properties, not even the property of not even having the property of having no properties, not even the property of the ability to nest that infinitely and still have no properties.
AAB - The Strange Entity Realm
[
]
AAB is a realm full of strange entities. It is completely isolated from everything else. It is basically its own alternate reality of strange entities.
Iskwaxy
Neumpagzoug
Peorwintramnaikub
An Iskwaxy is a strange entity. It is smaller than the concept of size itself. It can warp spacetime as well as warp the concept of concepts itself. However, it is a good entity, and it doesn't do that. It speaks an unknown language called Iskwax.
A Neumpagzoug is another strange entity. It is the size of the
Omniverse
. It doesn't exist, yet it exists at the same time somehow. It is unknown how this works.
A Peorwintramnaikub is a VERY strange entity. It █s █lso slightly c█rrupted, as you can s██ by the te█t h█r█. It is █ctually v█ry c███upted. I█ ha█ a bun██ of █ sym█ols where the█e █s los█ information. Y██ can█t g█t t█e in██rm██ion bac█.
AAC - The WHAT Realm
[
]
This realm is full of absolute nonsense. It is completely weird. Blow ink before apple word jumping quill kelp head not and metal thing help sink peeing to the object eye if my tube. Contain
Tube of Terror
.

AAE - The Mysterious Realm
[
]
AAE is a very mysterious realm. It is completely unknown. This right here is a stub because nobody knows anything about this realm.
AAF - The Google Translate Corrupted Realm
[
]
The site is compatible with Google. There is no message in this message. Swords.
AAG - The _ Realm
[
]
AAG is a realm full of creatures called Yontajuxes. Yontajuxes can't escape this realm, as it is made of a material called Naryusp.
Naryusp
[
]
Naryusp is an almost unbreakable material. It is

{\displaystyle \approx 3.78 \times 10^{67,892}}
x as strong as TREEYUM. There is not much else about Naryusp.
Escape Attempts
[
]
Escape Attempt #1
[
]
Escape attempt #1 was where they were able to get a bit of Naryusp. They tried to ram it into the wall. It didn't go through, and the attempt failed.
Escape Attempt #2
[
]
Escape attempt #2 was where they used some crazy indescribable reality warping to get through. This attempt was successful, but it took a LONG time to plan and set up. That is why this hasn't been done any other time, and only 4 Yontajuxes have exited AAG.
AAH - The
Tiny
Realm
[
]
AAH is a realm so tiny that it doesn't exist. It doesn't contain anything. It is impossible to detect. If there is a part of a description of something that makes it small, AAH has that part of its description. It is also smaller than everything smaller than it.
AB
[
]
AB is like a second AA, but with weirder stuff.
