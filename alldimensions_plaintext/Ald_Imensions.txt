Species
Constructor
Ald Imensions
, or simply
Ald
is an extremely powerful, well known, and VERY important entity within the Imensions family he hails from. He is the prince of his realm and is very young for his kind, and so he is very imaginative, even for a person his age he has so much within his mind that he's created.
ld comes from a powerful species of individuals capable of building entire hierarchies of -verses and realms alike. These are known as the Constructors, as they construct far more than they destroy. They can make a while building to scale of themselves on accident and can end everything here on a whim. Ald comes from a royal family of these beings, and is even more powerful. A royal or noble who has mastered their power can build whole planets by themselves.
Ald is a young prince, the second most powerful constructor, and he is currently practicing by making a large orb. What he also did was fill it with things. These things make up All dimensions wiki, every single part of the hierarchy is some kid's project and nothing can be done about it. The only page that might be considered to go outside these boundaries is this right here, as it is talking about Ald.
Ald is still waiting, creating infinite places a second until his project is full. Then he'll make it bigger for his project. He's also far larger than the orb in its current state. And to top it all off, the orb is almost all empty, and it has infinite places and -verses to go before it is full to a large degree. It can be surpassed, though.
