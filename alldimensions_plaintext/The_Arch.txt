How it works
[
]
The Arch envelops
The Glitch Hyperspace
almost completely. It is extremely elastic, and it can stretch to 1000000 times its original size when needed. Any verses, voids, or realities that get ejected from the chaotic
Glitch Spaces
and
The Glitch Space
will fly right into The Arch and get trapped. The Arch itself will decide when to launch the verse back.
Weird things that happened
[
]
The Arch sometimes has been known to launch the verses into the
The Vast Pseudo-Void
for apparently no reason. Most of the verses launched disappeared completely. For the verses that were found, analysis showed that they were actually from the
Obamaverse
. Some believe that The Arch is sentient. No one knows for sure if that is the case.
Life
[
]
There are many civilizations that live on The Arch. Most are quite advanced, and they have colonized a few verses on The Arch that were about to be ejected. This life has used The Arch to travel long distances extremely fast using The Arch's launch mechanism.
Materials
[
]
The Arch has proven to be almost indestructible. No matter how much you stretch The Arch and pound it with huge verses, The Arch doesn't get damaged. The material that The Arch is made out is currently being studied by creatures in
The Vast Pseudo-Void
.
It seems to only have one state of matter; and that is solid. It has only broken once, and that was with a ridiculously corrupted verse.
Something trivial

The Arch is contained in the name "Archurricane"
