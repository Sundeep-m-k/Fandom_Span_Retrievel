Enormousverses
usually have 567 layers per top level Enormousverse.
Hugeverses
are actually the
TGH
verses with the most even layering. Various types of physics exist within each Enormousverse and their layers, getting higher and higher on the
Eisler Value
as the verses go up.
It varies slightly and may go
down
between verses but the last layer is always higher valued than the lowest, with the highest EV Enormousverse was 17.3, and the lowest was only 7.1. Enormousverses usually vary in color as well, and many top-tier Enormousverses are named according to their hexadecimal value.
Each Enormousverse is of course different, but the levels of variety in this particular chain/layered verse are off the walls. Some examples of Enormousverses could not be found due to size. Our local tier-2 Enourmousverse has no planets, but the stars have various lifeforms. And stars are rare enough in Enormousverses anyways, so this is also truly impressive.
