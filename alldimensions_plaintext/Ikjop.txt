To find strange objects
Ikjop is a very strange entity that looks for strange objects. The most useful one he found was a VVVVVVEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY sharp crystal that was named after him and placed in the
Ontological Museum
.
List of things Ikjop discovered (for editing):
Don't Press The Button...
- A big red button that if you press it it spawns Ω²
Yetmmud
. It was VERY suprisingly NOT placed in the
Ontological Museum
. Probably so an evil entity couldn't press it and spawn all those
Yetmmud
when they accessed it.
That Random Cube of Glitchonicite.
- Just as the name says. Not much else.
