Existencies
are a sort of soups full of different
Esrevinmos
. They're extremely chaotic, and only one picture has ever been taken of them.
Structure
[
]
Existencies resemble rocky landscapes with lakes of gigantic proportions, filled with some soup that is made up of
Esrevinmos
and many existence states.
This soup is very dangerous due to the mish-mash of existence states. If you ever touch the lakes, you will get corrupted beyond even nonexistence and end up in a place almost no one can describe.
Beyond the lakes are a vast landscape with many other such lakes. These lakes house unknown creatures that no one has contacted yet. There are also many mountain ranges with mountains that over the lakes below.
The tallest mountain in an Existency is known as a Tower of the Gods.
There are also volcanoes that constantly erupt steam, primordial soup, and occasionally
Omni Lava
onto the ground.
Beyond Existency

Anything beyond Existencies is beyond our current understanding of reality and physics,
and so only
Gerald
,
Dunkey Kong
, and other Mary Sue-type gods can access them
(outdated).
