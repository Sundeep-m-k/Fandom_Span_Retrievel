Fifteen
(
"Grob'bas"
in
The Pencil Language
or
Pedak
in Future English) is a massive non-Euclidean verse, and is the 5th verse in the Eleven Chain.
Appearance
[
]
Fifteen, from the inside, appears to be an extremely glitchy and messy landscape, with many strange objects/symbols showing up for no apparent reason. From the outside, Fifteen appears to be a completely black sphere.
Structure
[
]
Fifteen has a very messy interior, with random symbols/objects floating around and glitching through the verse. These symbols and objects do not seem to have collision physics, and will just pass right through you if you try to touch them.
A few of these symbols/objects include:
A book symbol
An arrow
A cross shaped like an 'x'
An aqua-colored, 'v'-shaped symbol
A circle with a line extruding from its side
a triangle facing downwards
A formation of 3 dots
A pentagon with 2 of its vertices having lines going inwards and meeting at a right angle
One of the important objects is a massive "pencil". This pencil holds 15
Fourteens
, and bears a massive resemblance to a
Transcendent Omni-God
known as "ICantEdit".
