Structure
[
]
The Matterverse consists of many different types of planets, occasional black holes, and a core at the center of the Matterverse. However, the planets in the Matterverse have a special property of being able to multiply and seemingly create matter from nothing.
Planets
[
]
There are 6 normal types of planets in the Matterverse and 1 special type. Each type produces different types of matter, and can vary in size and produce different amounts of that matter.
Rock Planets
[
]
Rock Planets are the most common type of planet. They are usually not very big, but they can produce matter extremely fast.
The matter that Rock Planets produce are just simple space rock. The life in the Matterverse have used these planets to build structures and settle, since many of the other planets are either inhospitable or too dense.
Magma Planets
[
]
Magma Planets are some of the rarer planets, on average with 1 being seen in every 40 planets. Magma Planets always have no life, and produce magma from huge volcanoes on their surfaces. This magma is over 230x hotter than regular magma, and can melt a huge variety of things in seconds. If one is producing too much magma, they might have to be contained.
These planets are slightly bigger than Rock Planets.
Gem Planets
[
]
Gem Planets are some of the rarest planets found in the Matterverse, almost 10,000x rarer than the Magma Planets. Gem Planets can produce gems of all sorts, such as sapphire, ruby, diamonds, emerald, and much more. They are valued massively due to the rarity of the gems they produce.
Gem Planets are also the smallest planets.
Organic Planets
[
]
Organic Planets are some of the most interesting planets that can be found in the Matterverse. They are composed of 100% organic matter, and produce organic matter from alien plants on the planets' surface. Organic Planets are even rarer than Gem Planets, being about 50x rarer than them.
Organic Planets usually have the most life on them, and are also the biggest planets ever found in the Matterverse. It is unknown if the Organic Planets are sentient, though they probably aren’t.
Gaseous Planets
[
]
Gaseous Planets are another very common planet, with similar rarity as Rock Planets. Gaseous Planets, like the name suggests, are mainly composed of gas. Gaseous Planets can produce gas extremely fast, and have been seen to double their size in just one Earth year. These planets are not valued a lot, since they just produce gas, and nothing more.
These types of planets also have the strongest gravity. If one grows too large, creatures are forced to destroy it.
Glitchy Planets
[
]
Glitchy Planets are probably the weirdest and most elusive planets in the Matterverse. Only 3 Glitchy Planets have ever been seen in the Matterverse, and in all cases have corrupted the surroundings, summoning unknown creatures possibly from a different
Realm
.
Glitchy Planets have also been found to randomly change size, shape, temperature, and even dimensionality and existence rank. Further analysis of the material composing Glitchy Planets revealed that it was mostly
Glitchonicite
,
Corruptite
, and a little bit of
Toxicium
.
Still, no one knows why the planets were summoning these creatures. It’s likely that Glitchy planets are about 1 billion times rarer than organic planets.
Glass Planets
[
]
Glass Planets are a semi-rare type of planet that produce glass. Usually 1 can be found for every 23 planets, However, 80% of this glass is not normal. This glass is way stronger than typical glass, and can even withstand high energy plasma beams. It can also block corruptive materials, such as
Glitchonicite
and even
Corruptite
to a certain extent.
That has made these planets one of the most important types of planets in the entire Matterverse, and the life in the Matterverse use the glass frequently to make armor for spacecrafts, body armor, and also weapons.
Black Holes
[
]
Occasionally, a black hole will form somewhere inside the Matterverse due to planet collisions. These black holes are usually very small, and will most likely just disappear due to Hawking Radiation after a few hours.
However, some of these black holes have grown ridiculously huge, and have caused massive damage to planets around it. 2 of those incidents are listed in the table below.

Date
#1
379,238,289 solar diameters
A black hole formed after one of the Glitchy Planets suddenly collapsed into itself, forming a black hole. This black hole somehow grew bigger without actually swallowing anything, and proceeded to rip apart hundreds of planets and even damage the Core of the Matterverse. The black hole was only stopped after the Core destroyed the black hole due to the ridiculous gravity of the Core.
192 Rock Planets, 189 Gaseous Planets, 10 Magma Planets, and 1 Gem Planet were destroyed. The Core of the Matterverse was damaged a little bit.
189 OYC
#4
1,203,239,239 solar diameters
This black hole formed when about 180 planets smashed into each other, creating a ridiculous force that made a Rock Planet collapse into itself. This incident also happened in a very crowded section of the Matterverse where there were many planets, so the black hole swallowed almost all of them and grew huge. It then went on to swallow over 180,009,273 more planets, and had to be stopped by an Omni-God.

The Core
[
]
The Matterverse has a core at its center. This core is huge, at over 20,398,638,286,264 kilometers, and is responsible for keeping the Matterverse under control, such as destroying huge black holes and preventing the objects inside the Matterverse to fly out into interversal space.
The Core is spherical, and is made out of an extremely tough and strong metal that has not been named yet. It’s about 1 infinitesmall of the strength of the material that makes o r b’s shell, and The Core’s material is able to regenerate, although very slowly; regenerating 1 kilometer of the material takes 45 days.
Life
[
]
The life in the Matterverse have mainly settled on the Rock Planets, and have huge amounts of materials such as glass, rock, gas, and gems. This life has colonized many of the planets, and have developed lots of technology from these materials. This life has remained isolationist for the past 2793 OYC, and will probably never open up trade or contact other life.
This life has tried to keep the Matterverse hidden from outside civilizations due to fear of all their materials being taken by outside life, but other life has entered the Matterverse a few times.
Technology
[
]
The life in the Matterverse (let's just call them Matterversians) have developed many interesting contraptions. However, unlike their
Energyversian
counterparts, the Matterversians have not built any superstructures.
Glass Body Armor
[
]
The life have used the glass from Glass Planets to build body armor that can withstand many extremely powerful weapons, corrosive materials, and much more. This body armor has not been used by any outside life, and is very classified due to fears of other life discovering how to create the armor, and them using it against the Matterversians.
Magma Sprayers
[
]
The life has also used the magma from the Magma Planets, glass from the Glass Planets, and gems from the Gem Planets to create magma-sprayers. These weapons are extra deadly, since the magma from the Magma Planets are extra hot. However, the Magma Sprayers have never actually been used in battle before, and their only purpose is to melt glass from the Glass Planets.
