Usage
Compact Storage
Compact Machines are machines that harness the power of
thuons
to store more space inside them than would be geometrically possible. They are commonly used to store large machinery and other things that would be inconvenient to have out in the open. They possess input / output hatches to connect the two spaces. You can put compact machines inside compact machines indefinitely.
Structure
[
]
Compact machines have a very simple outside structure. They have a modularium framework, some material surface covers depending on the type and input/output holes on the center. The inside of the compact machines is a cubic chamber, padded with compact machine walls which are as hard as bedrock.
Types
[
]
There are various types of compact machine. These types vary in the amount of space they have on the inside:
Tiny Compact Machine (Inside space: 3x3x3 meters)
Small Compact Machine (Inside space: 5x5x5 metres)
Normal Compact Machine (Inside space: 7x7x7 metres)
Big Compact Machine (Inside space: 9x9x9 meters)
Giant Compact Machine (Inside space: 11x11x11 metres)
Maximum Compact Machine (Inside space: 13x13x13 meters)
Use
[
]
Compact machines are normally used for making things take up less space, like factories. Sometimes though, they are used to imprison
entities
in an almost inescapable prison. However, some very resourceful entities have the power to break out. To see how to do that, see
