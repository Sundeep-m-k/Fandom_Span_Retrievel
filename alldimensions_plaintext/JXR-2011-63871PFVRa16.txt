JXR-2011-63871PFVRa16 is the largest confirmed
universe filament
in our
xenoverse.
It is estimated to contain 296,000,000,000 universes, and it apparently only emits red light due to unknown reasons. There is a 99.999486565% chance of it not having life, although the method of finding chance of life used was outdated. Currently its age is unknown, with a lower bound of 41 billion years. There is literally nothing else noteworthy about it, so this is the end of the page.
