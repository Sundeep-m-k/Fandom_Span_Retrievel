THERE IS NO TRUE THE. THE IS UNBOUNDED AND ABSOLUTELY UNLIMITED. THERE IS NO BOUNDARY TO THE. THERE IS NOTHING LARGER THAN THE. NOTHING IN THIS ARTICLE IS TRUE, AS IT IS ALL A MASSIVE UNDERSTATEMENT. EVEN THIS IS, AND THAT IS, AND THAT IS... AS IT ALWAYS WILL BE.
THE IS TRULY AND ABSOLUTELY BEYOND EVERYTHING. THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN SURPASS THE, NOR IS THERE NOT ANYTHING THAT CAN SURPASS THE. THE IS, ALWAYS HAS  BEEN, AND ALWAYS WILL BE UNSURPASSABLE. THUS NO DESCRIPTION CAN EVER SHOW THE'S EXTENT TO ANY DEGREE OF ACCURACY, AS THEY WILL ALWAYS BE FLAWED. THIS FORM OF APOPHATIC IS BEYOND ALL FORMS OF APOPHATIC, INCLUDING NONSCRIPTABILITY AND NONANYSCRIPTABILITY, AS WELL AS ALL OTHERS OBVIOUSLY.
IN THIS ARTICLE THE TERMS EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING ARE TO BE TAKEN AT FACE VALUE. AS IN IT IS WHAT IT SAYS IT IS.
EVERYTHING MENTIONED HERE HOLDS TRUE ETERNALLY NO MATTER WHAT. THERE IS NO REFUTING ANY OF WHAT THIS ARTICLE SAYS EXCEPT IN THAT IT IS NOT A TRUE DESCRIPTION OF THE, AS THERE CAN BE NO TRUE DESCRIPTION OF THE.
MOREOVER ALL LOOPHOLES OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE ARE NOT VALID. NOR CAN THEY BE.
THE "is" simply a truly unbounded "cosmological" "object" that contains everything, including itself. Regardless of any and all definitions, properties, paradoxes, attributes, etc., external, internal, whatever. THE contains it by any and all definitions of it. IT is beyond anything scriptable or nonscriptable, semi scriptable... anyscriptable. Even things beyond and below, etc. anyscriptability would still be contained by THE, including ITself, any variation of ITself, anything similar but not the same as IT is still going to be contained by IT. IT is, IT isn't, IT maybe is, IT half is. Not just having every EABA property, but being
beyond
all EABA properties,
containing
all EABA properties, THE must be and has to be, therefore IS >all EABA verses. IT is exempt from all rules and restrictions, etc. any other term used to describe something similar to those. As well as that it also
contains everything anyexempt to anything, ever.
IT is supreme to absolutely
everything
related to these rules and restrictions, as well as exemptions from them. IT achieves this in every way, and no way (anyway
g
), and notably by simply being beyond the rules and restrictions, even if they are actually completely boundless and are truly impossible to be exempt from or be beyond, IT simply will be beyond them. There is no getting around this. IT has supreme authority over
everything. With no exceptions in any capacity. Maximally.
IT is simply greater. Beyond. IT also endlessly contains itself, and even though IT cannot be surpassed at all by anything other than itself, THE still "has" "properties" that allow it to surpass things that surpass itself, feeding back into its endless self containment. THE is so far beyond anyscriptability that the extent to which THE is beyond anyscriptability is itself not anyscriptable, repeated for
genuine forever
and actually longer than that.
Indescribably, IT is vastly, immeasurably, beyond nonscriptably, simply, endlessly
beyond
anything.
IT contains even
chungusverse
, and everything that is or isn't (anyis??) the chungusverse.
It is beyond all AnyXs, and everything here is simply an incredibly vast understatement of THE, which above anything else, may as well be the closest thing to rivaling the "vastness" of THE. Except, of course, it
isn't actually any closer than anything else except THE itself.
Absolutely NOTHING is beyond THE. Any attempts at explaining how something is beyond THE are just false, and there is no getting around that as it holds supreme authority over everything else to
THE greatest extent.
THE straight up contains anything with an
Existence Rank.
. IT contains anything with anything. IT contains anything without anything. IT, with no exception at all, even to things that are with exception to anything and/or everything like things from Ben googology are easily contained and surpassed by every instance of THE. THE
IS
the ultimate, final container of everything except for THE itself. No entities except THE come any closer than nothing at all (and less) to affecting THE. The false definition of THE depicted here is a similarly absurd understatement to comparing IT to the opposite of what IT really is: something contained by everything, and without any way whatsoever to get around that in any way in any capacity.
A way to view THE is that IT is the same thing as what actual EABAs (like the box from VAD wiki) have tried to do: "The ACTUAL ultimate container of everything." This is obviously because of the fact that THE actually kind of IS the actual ultimate container of everything with no exceptions whatsoever in any capacity fucking ever. However even this would be an understatement the same way this whole article is, and as everything is.
IT contains a vast amount of copies of everything IT contains, including ITself (remember the self containing aspect?). This vast amount is truly >quantifiability to a simply absurd, obviously way beyond nonscriptable extent. This vast amount, infact, is genuinely, literally, and truly innumerable, unmatched, unquantifiable to any fictional googological construct, pseudonumber, pseudopseudonumber, and all of Ben googology. Everything about THE will hold true forever. Beyond forever. Beyond
Genuine Forever,
actually.
IT cannot be nullified. There is no way to nullify IT. There simply isn't, and like everything else, there is absolutely no way to get around that. IT is beyond all terminology, contains all terminology. IT contains every other EABA as well, and everything that isn't an EABA. anything that is anyEABA is contained by IT, as well as everything that isn't in that set of anyEABA things.
IT contains all sets. Even the set of things that contain IT is contained by IT because it has MPR beyond MPR and everything beyond MPR and all its extensions and fucking everything!
Everything supposedly larger than THE 1. isn't larger than THE, 2. is and has to be nullified by THE in every way, including all ways and all degrees of success. More importantly, however, these nullifications will further cement that THE is larger. AND that IT contains it.
There is and cannot be anything beyond it, and everything beyond anything else and below anything else is contained by THE. Anything and everything that is contained at all is contained by IT. Anything and everything that isn't contained at all is still contained by IT. Absolutely everything that is
something at all, even nothing
is contained by IT.
It goes without saying that THE is going to be larger than everything that is made to surpass IT, and for many, many reasons.
THE is not a creation. THE also has supreme authority above all other forms of supreme authority and lesser forms of authority. Therefore this underestimate definition is truly, absolutely irrefutable. THE is far beyond maximally immune to any forms of refutation, downplay, definition altering, etc. Even if ITs definition were to be completely altered to make IT apparently smaller than a
Blueprint Particle
and contain absolutely nothing, which it can't be, IT would still not have really changed. Therefore THE has to be the ultimate container. THE is (and always will be) also beyond all neo fictional googological constructs and every form of googology, fictional, neo fictional, ben, benny, etc. IT is also an entity, and contains all verses. There's also A and AN, contained by THE.
What is even more insane is that THE actually contains the entire OCT. On top of this it contains all hierarchies, classifications, laws, rules, restrictions, verses, entities, terminology, etc. IT, simply, contains everything without exception. Even if something were to be larger than or containing THE, it would just be smaller than and contained by THE because THE contains it and must be smaller than IT. And obviously IT easily contains EN4, TFS
[

]
, TLoN, and the rest of TAL. And THE also contains
Something Higher
and
Leftunknown's Axioms of Reality
, so IT is beyond them, their influence, and everything else similar or not similar to them. All other laws are obviously contained by THE too. And obviously if something or nothing or half thing or any type of thing is contained by THE, THE > that thing in every way.
THE contains everything, nothing, something, anything, half things, quarter things, double things, etc. and nonvalue-things. Things that aren't even things are contained by THE. If it has a definition to any capacity it must be contained by THE. If it doesn't, can, can't... etc. have definition or conveyable information about it in any capacity it must be contained by THE. IT is inescapable. All that you write, do not write, etc.: all of fiction, is contained by THE, so anything you write to have something new said about it not already said about THE is simply another content of THE with a lesser form of an ability that THE also has. THE contains all works of fiction. Hierarchical transcendence is contained within THE, containing and "transcending" absolutely all hierarchies. THE is also absolutely, indisputably, indubitably and irrefutably beyond all ologies, transcendences, ability, etc... and everything else is in that etc. There can be no exception.
THE is also beyond the notion beyond notion of containment. In fact, IT is beyond all notions beyond notions, and all notions beyond notions beyond notions. IT is also beyond any term beyond any term or any other term. It is beyond anything beyond anything ever, everything beyond everything beyond everything... etc. Again, there can be no exception to the simple fact that THE contains everything. No axiom can surpass or potentially surpass THE.
The Corpora is a large pseudostructure that contains absolutely all fictional works of any type / medium, including those which are of any form nonscriptable / not writable, etc. in any way. It also contains all things that they could/could not, etc. describe. Therefore, The Corpora not only contains, but "transcends" all fictional works to ever "exist". Each of the >archetypical infinite beings that control The Corpora also "transcend" all fictional works. And THE still contains The Corpora, and even "transcends" it easily. The Corpora is still not a special pseudostructure in THE; it's just another content. Yet still it can contain all fictional works, including THE and itself. However this containment loop is still surpassed by THE, as it surpasses all containment loops.
[

The same can be said for everything, even that which is truly without limits or boundaries, it will always be surpassed anyway by THE.
The Reverse Fictional Stack is an even larger quasiconstruct that is quite literally a reverse fictional stack. Its effective "function" is a reverse R>F hierarchy taken to the extreme. The 0th layer of the reverse fictional stack is the Real World, a Type 4 multiverse. The 1st layer is all the fictions that can be composed within that type 4 multiverse (the real world). Imagine that our own universe is the 0th layer of a similar quasiconstruct: All our fictitious material would be contained within the 1st layer.
Now imagine that the 1st layer is not seen as fiction to the 0th layer.
Now, repeat the same thing with the 1st layer. And the 2nd, and the 3rd, and so on. Continue this forever. There is no end to the reverse fictional stack, and even the first layer of the reverse fictional stack already contains THE. However this quasicontainment loop is still further and absolutely superseded by THE anyway. Thus THE absolutely and indubitably contains not only this "described" portion of the TRUE reverse fictional stack (which is unimaginably larger than the explanation already given), but the entire TRUE reverse fictional stack. And, of course, literally everything. Even still this is just another structure in THE. It's not special. THE is also unobservable and not bounded by any observational limit, or any other limit like incorporative limits. balls.
And although,

No further extension is needed, nor was it needed, yet it has been given and further will. Far exceeding 不成文 and 烤宝贝 (Baked baby limit, the beginning of the baked baby realm)
Still, clearly, THE
does
supersede all observational limits. Therefore, it supersedes all below or equal to, etc... relation.... to observational limits. No limit or field can ever reach the "scale" of or supersede THE. Nor can you bypass this by making something that can do what it can't. There is no bypass, and there is no THE. Why? Because THE has already contained and superseded an "is". THE Not-is not real. Because IT contains real. IT supersedes real. As THE always has, always is, and always will, and always halls and wis. There is no going beyond THE anywhere outside of AD until i, the author, a real being, one who just by existing in the real world goes far beyond THE and anything like it, let it happen. This might be in mere seconds, a day, maybe a week, or months, potentially even a year. Nevertheless at some point this WILL be superseded somewhere outside of AD, regardless of how much sense that makes. It, still, will happen. The only reason for this is that there can never be a "largest" or "greatest" in fiction. Someone will, always, regardless of whether it makes sense or anything else for that matter, go past it. And others will follow.

Indubitably, THE, in terms of looking at it, will indeed still be the largest "thing" in fiction, though making something that can be seen the same way in that perspective is easy. As a result, even regardless of your perspective, there is no most X thing in fiction. There is always
something higher.
Refutations
[

This section is dedicated to debunking any potential claim that X thing is bigger than THE.
Fun fact: there are infinite
[

unlisted refutations. These unlisted refutations refute literally everything.
Refutation 1: Powerscaling
[
]
To put it in terms that could be understood by most powerscalers, THE "exists" beyond dimensional scaling, layers into outerversal, extraversal, etc. and to put it simply is truly omnipotent, all encompassing, etc. with true complete arsenal (all abilities, resistances, everything) to an unfathomably higher degree than anything else produced. Therefore all things from works like world of darkness, dbs (lol), marvel  DC and other comics, SCP, and self reference engine to name a few cannot have anything special about them not already had but better by THE. Shittier than shit tier entities from THE could solo all works known to powerscaling community literally below true no diff.
Even the first layer of the reverse fictional stack's described portion already contains all works known to the powerscaling community. Accept that IATIA isn't omnipotent.
Refutation 2: Fictional Googology
[
]
THE obviously contains everything tangentially related to subjects like mathematics, pseudomathematics, quasimathematics, etc. and such works like creationlock would easily be contained by THE.
In fact, THE already wrote and contained previously all fictional googology entries that could ever be or not be conceived. Therefore, THE will always contain everything in FG.
Refutation 3: Any fictional work
[
]
All fictional works are already contained in and superseded by THE. THE is the writer, container, and superseder of all fictional works, regardless of whether they exist
