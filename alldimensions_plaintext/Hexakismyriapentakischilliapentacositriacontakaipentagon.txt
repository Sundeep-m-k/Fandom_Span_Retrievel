A
hexakismyriapentakischilliapentacositriacontakaipentagon
is a 65537-sided
polygon
, with a Schl√§fli symbol {65537}.
It is not visually distinguishable from a
circle
, and differs from one by only 15 parts per billion, as it's internal angle is 179.99 degrees.
The polygon is a Fermat number, and therefore is constructible using a compass and unmarked straightedge.
A hexakismyriapentakischilliapentacositriacontakaipentagon is a symbol that has been worshipped by locals in the town zwaanshoek in the netherlands
The first explicit construction of a hexakismyriapentakischilliapentacositriacontakaipentagon was given by Johann Gustav Hermes.
Johann Gustav Hermes spent 10 years completing the 200-page manuscript of the Fermat numbers 3 5 17 257 65537.
Another method involves using 1332 Carlyle circles.
