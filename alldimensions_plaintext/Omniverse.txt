Omniverses
are
verses
that contain a countably infinite amount of
Archverses
, ending with
universes
at the lowest level. They're the largest official Archverses in our local
Wikiverse
, and the largest Archverses in the original chain (
Universe
,
multiverse
,
metaverse
,
xenoverse
,
hyperverse
, omniverse).

Structure
[
]
An Omniverse has a fractal structure resembling a random sphere packing. Unlike from the Apollonian gasket or Kleinian circle packing, the size and position of verses are
random
and spaces between verses exist, mostly being filled by
Omni-Web
. But at the smallest verses, you may see that verses are arranged in an orderly way instead, unexpectedly.
Each Omniverse contains an
Ultraverse
, which serves as a quick gateway to different-sized
Archverses
, which is hidden from a looped dimension throughout this Omniverse. In the Ultraverses, you may see different Archverses, but visualized as same-size spheres.
Civilization
[
]
Many civilizations have created their own superstructures that hold
thousands of verses of equal size revolving around a central one
, or more. A lot of more civilizations managed to get out of all Archverses with and reach
Ultraverse
, which they build a subway to their own
Archverses
.
Our Omniverse
[
]
Our Omniverse is located in an
Allomniverse
, which also contains another 11 neighborhood Pseudo-Omniverses, which all have different, smaller sizes and different ratios of
existence
and
nonexistence
. They were clustered by an Omniverse civilization, when they unexpectedly found some of those from the deep layers of
The Outside
.
Our Omniverse is one of the most
popular structures of our local
Realm
, as it was chosen to be a hub for most deities, gods, creatures, and civilizations.
Alongside that
, the Omniverse holds historical importance, as
many ancient relics can be founds here
, with hundreds of museums of artifacts from all over the Realm, libraries, community centers, governments, and research centers, that were all built here.
Essentially, the Omni
verse.
Local Omniverse's creation
[
]
Back when our local
Box
was created, its recursive layers were
infinitely
unstable
. Many of them collapsed inwards on themselves and disappeared into thin air. This did nothing, because our Box was empty and non-finality based yet,
but it had an infinite number of layers
.
After an infinite cluster of layers demanifested, one layer, which was either special in some way, or collapsed in the right way, or maybe a phenomenon happened at the exact same moment,
it is unknown what really happened but we know it happened with the collapse of a layer
, caused a massive, infinitely sized explosion inside, which rattled our Box and turned it into a maximally chaotic state for the next ~
ω
ω
{\displaystyle \omega^{\omega}}
OYC. During this stage of chaos, through pure chance, our Box
slowly brought upon itself the property of being 2-finality
.
As this happened, objects of
existence
-(0,1) were first-ever constructed on it. Then existence-2, existence-3, and so on. The problem is, that existence-4 and existence-5 objects
attract each other
(positive and negative attractions between icosahedra variants described in the
Other Box
article), and as two far apart ones and giant ones did so,
they smashed together, producing an incredible explosion
, blasting away the majority of all non-existence-(0,1) objects, and in the process, causing the formation of 12 Omniverses. One of them was special, containing all existence-1 objects, and so it was given the name of
the Xenoverse
, while the others were just
Pseudo-Omniverses
.
Another reason for its significance, and a deciding factor for it becoming labeled as special, and the other ones as mere "pseudos", was due to the absolutely unmatched amounts of Archverses packed together, which were not only patterned, but some also patternless, some had life, some were empty, some had ordered cubistic looks, while some were fractaled.
Trivia
[
]
Omniverse
, in the old version of Aarex's cosmology, contains everything else, including (non-)existences, types, abstracts, and concepts. It proves the Omniverse is similar to
The V&D Box
.
They
rank high 1-B
in powerscaling due to their countably infinite dimensionality.
