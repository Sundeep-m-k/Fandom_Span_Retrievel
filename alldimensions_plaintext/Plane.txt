The plane has
length
and
width
. The plane also refers to a hypothetical two-dimensional space of infinite extent; this use is used, for example, when describing
tilings
of the plane. Points on the plane can be shown using two coordinates, written as
(
x
,
y
)
{\displaystyle (x,y)}
. In analogue with
Space
.

Polyominoes
[
]
Polyominoes
are two-dimensional figures consisting of multiple
squares
fixed edge-to-edge. There are an infinite number of
polyominoes
, and the number of
polyominoes
increases with the amount of
squares
allowed.
Coordinates on the Plane
[
]
There are two coordinate systems that can be used to define points on the plane - Cartesian coordinates, and polar coordinates.
Cartesian coordinates consist of two distances - the left-right distance from the origin, and the up-down distance from the origin. This is written as
(
x
,
y
)
{\displaystyle (x,y)}
. Cartesian coordinates where either
x
or
y
are fixed trace out an infinite
line
. Cartesian coordinates where both are fixed trace out a
point
, and where none are fixed trace out a plane. Polar coordinates consist of a distance and an angle - the overall distance from the origin, and the angle of the point from horizontal. This is written as
(
x
,
θ
)
{\displaystyle (x,\theta )}
. Polar coordinates where
x
is fixed trace out a
circle
; polar coordinates where
θ
is fixed trace out an infinite
line
. Polar coordinates where both are fixed trace out a
point
, and where none are fixed trace out a plane. When converting from polar to Cartesian coordinates, the equations
x

θ
=
x
{\displaystyle x\cos { \theta  } =x}
and

{\displaystyle x\sin{\theta  } =y}
can be used. When converting from Cartesian to polar coordinates, the equations

and
