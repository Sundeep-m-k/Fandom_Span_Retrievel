The
finality index
, written as
n-finality
, is a rank assigned to specific, very large verses, containers, etc...
A verse with an n-finality rank contains
all things under a specific label
, with the labels being more broad, as n gets larger. An n-finality object also contains everything below it, for example, a
Box
contains everything that doesn't exist
(2-finality)
, but also everything that exists, aka, the
Omniverses
(1-finality). There is no limit to how large the
n
in
n
-finality can be
, as there are an unending number of labels, which then logically brings about the existence of an unending ascending hierarchy of broader labels, despite what our limited human languages can comprehend and describe.
Two containers can have the same finality rank but are expected to be different in size or contain more. An example of this is the Boxes and
the Complex Boxes
.

How finality functions
[
]
Finality is an inherent property which is built into everything via information. This splits everything in our
Reality
into two groups, that being
finality based containers
, which have actual finality indexes, and
everything else
, which simply abides by the rules of finality. Finality containers usually have their own unique method of not allowing their objects to escape. This property of inability to wander outside of a container is similar to a law, except that it physically cannot be broken and applies the same everywhere, equally, in our Reality. Here are two good examples:
Omniverse
: doesn't allow the object to travel at infinite speeds. Any object outside of the Omniverse will physically be unable to exist.
The Box
: made of self-containing layers, even in the opposing direction. Therefore, any attempt at traveling or teleportation will simply loop back upon itself through The Box's infinite layers.
Examples
[
]
1-finality
(
Omniverse
)
contains everything that exists.
This is the base of the finality function.
2-finality
(
The Box
)
contains everything that exists and doesn't exist.
3-finality
(
The Clock
) likely subsumes existence, non-existence and describability. (decided upon by the community)
4-finality
(
The Flower
) thus contains all that is describable and indescribable, but maybe not all that is conceivable.
5-finality
(
The Soul
) may be the barrier of natural (or even formal) language, and as such, is unknown in more detail.
Supremums
[
]
6-finality
(
The Supremum of Order
) contains everything that obeys the Axiom of Order.
7-finality
(
The Supremum of Chaos
)  contains everything that obeys the Axiom of Chaos.
8-finality
(
The Supremum of Noise
)  contains everything that obeys the Axiom of Noise.
9-finality
(
The Supremum of Limits
)  contains everything that obeys the Axiom of Limits.
10-finality
(
The Supremum of Zero
) contains everything that obeys the Axiom of Zero.
Specific finality indexes
[
]
3/4-finality concerns describability and indescribability. This does not cover objects whose
information
is unreadable in any way or totally readable. This simply involves objects which can not be 100% constructed through a finite number of properties and characteristics. Of course, if one were to somehow clone all of the information which makes up an object located in The Flower, one would see an exact replica of said object appear in front of them. However, this is physically impossible in anything above The Clock, thanks to how finality imposes itself.
5-finality and above is, as of right now, sadly inaccessible using human language, whether natural or constructed. However, it is theoretically possible, that if someone combined complex (higher-order) logic and a human language (preferably English?), through some weird and impractically difficult method, 5-finality and above could be talked about and even imagined. This has not happened yet, and is unlikely to ever happen, but is however possible.
Subfinality Index
[
]
The Subfinality Index works the same way as the finality index. However, it is much weaker and allows more wiggle room.
A container which is of n-subfinality contains all objects which possess n properties. Unlike finality, however, they don't have to be in any specific order.
If container X contains all objects with property A and property B, but B is a special case of A, then B is ignored when counting.
Objects which are strictly n-final are also n-subfinal.
(This is just a modified version of the
end-all-be-all index
.)
