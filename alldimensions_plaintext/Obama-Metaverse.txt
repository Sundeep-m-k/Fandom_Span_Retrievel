About
[
]
The
Obama-
Metaverses
were the biggest and the last out of the
Obamaverse
chain
before the existence (creation) of the
Obama xenoverses
and
megaverses
. They're
simulations
created by Barrack Obama to exert his control over the cosmos.
Layers
[
]
The structure of an Obama-Metaverse is quite strange, since it exists on a higher level of reality(?).
First layer
[
]
The first layer is a place that contains many
planets
,
stars
, and other "normal" things. It is also the biggest layer out of them all. An Obama-Metaverse appears orange and red. It is orange/red due to the extreme abundance of Obamium-171 and Obamium-178 isotopes in the first layer, which are orange/red in gas form and are emitted by many dwarf obama stars.
All of these planets are colonized by the usual abundant
life
, except for Obama's private planets.
Second layer
[
]
The second layer is a liquid layer of Obamium that appears green. This layer is extremely toxic, and no life can survive in this layer due to the ridiculously corrosive liquid Obamium.
Third layer
[
]
The last layer is a completely solid layer, and this is where the ~1,283,382,102
Obama-Multiverses
simulations are kept at. This layer is extremely well protected, as to avoid evil entities or dangerous
verses
from corrupting/destroying the fragile simulations. Also, no life exists in this layer either.
Life
[
]
The life here is abundant. All of the life lives in the first layer, since the first layer is the only one that is habitable. This life also worships Barack Obama, just like the previous life in the Obama-Multiverses and
Obamaverses
. They are quite powerful, having even destroyed nigh-omnipotent
gods
before. However, that does not mean that they themselves are omnipotent.
Appearance
[
]
An Obama-Metaverse usually appears orange and a little bit shiny to us humans.
