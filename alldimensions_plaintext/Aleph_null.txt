Aleph Null
Value
'"`UNIQ--postMath-00000001-QINU`"'
Properties
Inaccessible through finite numbers, addition becomes asymmetric ('"`UNIQ--postMath-00000002-QINU`"'),  cardinality of all natural numbers, integers, rational and irrational numbers
Aleph Null, represented as
ℵ
0
{\displaystyle \aleph_0}
, is the smallest infinite cardinal number. It contains all natural numbers, and is followed by Aleph 1 -
ℵ
1
{\displaystyle \aleph_1}
. Due to this, Aleph Null is a benchmark in size. It is also weakly inaccessible and most its ordinal counterpart is omega -
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
. Applying mathematical notations on
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
doesn't change its size, as it doesn't actually change the size of the set, but merely incorporates it with other sets in a different set. Meanwhile
ℵ
0
{\displaystyle \aleph_0}
and
ℵ
1
{\displaystyle \aleph_1}
have an actual cardinal size difference.
Some of the
Omniverse
's properties have a value of
ℵ
0
{\displaystyle \aleph_0}
