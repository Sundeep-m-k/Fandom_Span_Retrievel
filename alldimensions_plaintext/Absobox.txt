The
Absobox
is a very large box, but it contains many more boxes than the others.
It contains every
Universe
possible or impossible. This means that every Universe is inside the Absobox.
Structure
[
]
The Absobox is made out of an outside which is solid, and inside there is completely full things. The Absobox has no empty space.
Quantum mechanics happen a lot in the Absobox, and even they don't have empty spaces. They are filled up with even smaller quantum-level objects. This is an infinite fractal.
Appearance
[
]
From the outside, the Absobox looks like a box, and then a mess of colour in the middle. While it looks like there is a lot of void, there isn't. These are just very very small objects that are invisible to the naked eye.
