Super NAs
are truly large and impressive fractal structures, and they're very easy to traverse as well. Their multitude of infinite expanses mean that these places are teeming with trade and prosperity. For another odd thing, the
NAs
here are all exactly the same, having
the MAXes
on the same dimensions in the same spot.
Due to their tight space, many tall bridges are constructed between
NAs
within here, and vehicles fast enough to traverse this still infinitely long bridges are also sold like hotcakes. These locations' other weird features is that they looks very much like a regular NA, only the NAs are black splotches in a white plain (it is in the picture, you immediately know.), taking up almost the whole things.
