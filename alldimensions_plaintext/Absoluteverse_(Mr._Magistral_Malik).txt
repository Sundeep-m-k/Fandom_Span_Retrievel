Note: This page talks about the Absoluteverse consisting of Time Majesty: Ruffus Adventures - The Absolute Anthology made by Mr. Magistral Malik and Danganronpa v666: Toon of Doom by Malik and Nocty. As any prior or ongoing TMRA works, any other Danganronpa stuff canon or Fanon that has nothing to do with this Danganronpa adaptation whatsoever, or the original Absoluteverse  are not the actual entire focuses of this article. Thus only information pertaining to only Time Majesty: Ruffus Adventures - The Absolute Anthology and Toon of Doom and anything that is expanded upon through these only works should be placed onto here.
The Absoluteverse
is a Universe persisting through two independent works that share the same universes together like a twelve chapter Archive of Our Own original series known as Time Majesty: Ruffus Adventures - The Absolute Anthology by Mr. Magistral Malik who had made Magistralverse, as well as an upcoming Danganronpa comic-novel hybrid series Danganronpa v666 Toon of Doom by Malik and Nocty intended to primere on Archive of Our Own as well.
Time Majesty: Ruffus Adventures - The Absolute Anthology
[
]
This is an original mini-novel series premiering on Archive of Our Own that is founded by and constructed by Mr. Magistral Malik to construct an idea of Time Majesty: Ruffus Adventures that takes the earlier elements from the original elements of TMRA and form it more differently creating a different story premise while keeping some of the similarities. It is similar to Scott Cawthon’s Five Night’s At Freddy’s novels which are headcanon adaptations. It is intended to still premiere after a hiatus to finish the last few chapters  that will total up to twelve chapters.
Danganronpa v666 Toon of Doom
[
]
Danganronpa v666: Toon of Doom is a comic novel in development that intends to premiere on Archive of Our Own. It pertains to the same premise as the Danganronpa franchise series with a twist with the cast instead not being teenagers but cartoon/anime characters from numerous fictional cartoon/anime media like Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney XD, and Netflix.
Trivia

It is unknown if the works will make a crossover or just simply share the same universes.
