Rules
This is not an exhaustive list. Administrators will communicate ambiguous policies via the Message Wall, if necessary.
Pages must follow quality standards:
If a page lacks content or is poorly written, it will be moved under the creator's userpage (User:XXX/YYY), blogged (moved to User blog:XXX/YYY), or deleted.
This covers extremely short pages, spam pages, end-all-be-all pages, cliche pages with no substance, and
salad number
pages.
This also applies to unfinished pages that are in the main namespace. Work in progress pages should be located under a user's sandbox.
If a page is improved by its creator, it can be migrated again to the main namespace.
The primary purpose of page is to
inform
within a
fictional canon
from a
neutral perspective
. As such, broken or distracting visuals and poorly styled pages will be removed.
Read your Message Wall and other notices from administrators.
Have common sense:
Don't vandalize, spam pages, or harass other users.
Do not derail pages:
When modifying an actively maintained article, don't make major modifications without consent, excluding style and grammar fixes.
Grammar modifications don't require consent.
Lore extensions don't require consent if marked as part of a separate canon.
Writing style can be modified without consent if the current article is littered with distracting errors.
