Reggaebots
are nanobots that are designed to collect and dissect verses to use for construction projects (if the bot finds them useless). Although their masters are usually neutral cosmic entities like
Scalene
,
Isosceles
, or
The Creator
,they can sometimes have their modules altered by a malicilous entity and be changed to destroy any verse they encounter. Because of their verse dissecting ability, reggaebots can also easily defeat actual blood-and-flesh cosmic entities, but a team of at least 583 of them are required because of their size.

History
[
]
Reggaebots were first discovered by the 859th great grandchild of
Isosceles
's cousin when they found the remains of the of an old computer inside
The Omni Computer Room
. Being an Oakverse construction employee, they reported that the scrap should be sent to the headquarters for further investigation.
Oakverse Construction Engineers 14916 through 15008 found that half of the computer's memory register and two-thirds of the multiplexer was to store pieces of decaying
Universes
, and that they could reconstructed to make a trashcan. After this was reported, engineers 15009 through 16538 replaced the components accordingly and added in the CPU of an old model of
The Machine
to create a Reggaebot. This first model of a Reggaebot eventually caused the
Oakverse
accident which auto-generated verses beyond
Quod Transfinita
, but it and about 900 clones of it were eventually used in the construction of
Name Not Found
.

is thrown into a positive-size verse and dies.
The Creator
isn't killed at all because the code was programmed to avoid deleting everything.
