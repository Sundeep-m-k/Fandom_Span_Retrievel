JERALDFERNO1!1!1!1!!1!1!1!1!1!1!11 THE PLACE WHERE JERALD THE MOTHSTER TORTURES EVIL GODMODE ENTITIES AND THE SOULS
TIME
AND
SPACE
HAS COLLECTED!!!! and fudgecake is just passing through
Here's how it went:
Fudgecake:
passes through a portal
hey jerald!! I think we haven't met for like 2 months or something what you doing
Jerald: stuff, but tho, hey fudgecake! I don't think I seen you this like big or something
Fudgecake: yeah I like grown or something, anyways what's that werid blue thing and that weird white face
Jerald: that's the Over(not so godly)Godly Mosasaur who's just dead at this point even in Jeraldferno which is just hell but worse like a infinitely more times worser
Fudgecake: and the white one?
Jerald: that's the emperor of memekind, he tried to like stab me and TIME (and SPACE) with his stupidly long list of powers, and the head thingy is his true form which I annihilated, so much for a emperor of memes
Fudgecake: what kind of Emperor dies to damn moths
Jerald: that one
Fudgecake: anyways bye I'm gonna pass through multiple allspheres because I am gonna go to that weird ULTRA cosmology I recently found out which is called GODMODES wiki and our ULTRA cosmology is called all dimensions wiki, I think those guys u like killed or something came from that
Jerald: you are absolutely right, they did came from that and they're a mindless swarm called the HORDE
Fudgecake: sounds like a pain in the you know what anyways bye
passes through
Jerald: bye
