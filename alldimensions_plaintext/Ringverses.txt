The
Ringverses
are a set of universes that all circle around a core (and eachother), all except one of which are torus-shaped and are almost entirely unexplored due to their unpredictable and everchanging temperature. The spaces between the Ringverses have "lightning-like" charges, which generate no energy but are much more damaging than earthly lightning. The core in the center is extremely radioactive and will burn almost anything coming into the "inner center".
