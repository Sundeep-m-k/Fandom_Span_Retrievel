About
[
]
The
Boxials
are a type of
Boxes
that consist of series of lines that make infinitely high dimensional cubes which contain
Mandelbrothverses
. In this situation, these Mandelbrothverses acts as hyperspheres, and as you go into higher dimensions, the less space in a cube a hypersphere takes up, so therefore the Mandelbrothverses are infinitely small compared to their Boxial and still touch the edges. This property has allowed some
beings
to escape their Mandelbrothverses and explore the infinite in comparison place that awaited them inside of their local Boxials.
Properties
[
]
These places have been confirmed to be
Universe
-like spaces that expand infinitely across the places that normally would be
void
, aka where the Mandelbrothverses aren't found. The laws of physics in these places are as follows: The speed of light in the expanses is the speed that an object would have to go to reach from one side of their Boxial to the other in one
Voidsecond
, the force of gravity is usually ~1.5x the one of
our universe
, and that in certain pockets of space the laws of physics can be completely different.
Trivia

A random Boxial is where the
Isolation
can be found, which contains the
Seeker
.
