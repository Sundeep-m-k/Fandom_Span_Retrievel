Here is the OG one:
Beyond
Beyond
is an unknown place, were an enormous, almost infinite amount of
Barrels
are inside it. Every light here is one barrel. We don't know what shape and surface exactly it is, if its an circle, an square, etc. Same goes with size, but we have approximations. It is disconnected from
Infinifold
, as it is disordered.
It is like a dark, barren void and the temperature is mostly cold, but in the places near the Barrels are extremely hotter. Except in parts which are Barrels.
Surface
[
]
This place is denoted as a point of no return in sight, as logic is already defied and disordered right there. Spacetime itself in there is bent beyond recognizable, meaning you would be easily lost on the departure of a Barrel. Even when you get out, everything in you would freeze permanently without traces. There is also no meaning of the unknown source from
Dimensional Blueprint Particles
and
Negaexistence
.
The only way of escaping this unknown place, is to let be yourself suddenly reordered, causing yourself to perfectly reform in another Barrel, with perfect order of logic. However, that is extremely low, as you might be stuck there or have your logic distorted by chaos.
Below the Surface
[
]
"Below" the surface, there are "darker" bubbles of sub-protoscopic "entities" harvested for Logicium. There are entirely no traces, and unknown how they are decomposed of. An anomaly there is it is slowly decaying as ranks pushing towards
absolute null
, connecting a link to
The Dark
.
