Our Multiverse
is the
Multiverse
inside of which
our Universe
is located in.
Multiverses contain Universes of similar, but different, starting conditions, and as such, timelines. Most Universes  in our Multiverse have astronomical structures just like our Universe, that being: galaxies, stars, planets, etc. However, the
laws
of our Multiverse are very sensitive and unstable, causing much higher chances of oddities and mutative Universes.
Our Multiversal Brane contains 147,588,143 Universes, where each one is labelled with the UNI- prefix, continued by the number in order of when it was discovered. Obviously, this makes our Universe UNI-1, however, this is far from official and is simply how we humans labelled them. Thanks to how we explored and mapped our Multiverse, the Universes are ordered not only in discovery date, but also most of them are in distance away from our Universe. The rare exceptions to this are crazily big Universes, which are much easier to find and sense.
A Multiversal Brane is a 3-dimensional space that is the diameter of the entire multiverse. There are over 930 billion of multiversal branes in our multiverse.

Universes
[
]
The actual laws that govern the Universes within a Multiverse is determined by the Universes themselves, which is why the concepts that can be seen within our Multiverse are already familiar and similar to the quantum and astronomical worlds. Whilst the following certainly holds for the Universes in our Multiverse, they slowly start to change as one goes to other Multiverses within our
Metaverse
.
Every single time the word "Universes" is mentioned, we are talking about specifically Universes within our Multiverse, not Universes in general.
Universe Borders
[
]
Universe borders, not just for our Multiverse but for most Universes in general, curve and twist space to expand outwards. This causes many weird phenomena when it messes with laws and particles inside of the Universe, for example, the apparent infinitude or the omnipresent-center of our own Universe, when none are such in reality.
The closer one gets to the edge of a Universe, the less developed and more empty the space gets, as structures like stars and galaxies haven't had enough time to settle and produce themselves. However, virtual particles pop up absolutely everywhere, which also includes at the very edge of the Universe. Usually they obliterate each other, but when one stays inside of the Universe and the second leaves it, a phenomenon akin to reverse Hawking radiation occurs, which actually makes the Universe grow.
Darismuth's System
[
]
The
Darismuth's System
is an extension of the
solar system
to Universes. Universes come with a bucket list of forces and overlapping forces which create other forces. One of these acts very similarly to gravity, which can cause Universes to fall in orbits of each other. However, this special force is on par with strength as any other force, which means that the central Universe, called the
Darismuth Universe
, must be substantially large, precisely, it must be more than 544 billion light-years in diameter. Otherwise, other forces from neighbouring Universes are 100% guaranteed to destabilize the orbit within a finite amount of time, no matter what.
Darismuth Universes are named after the astrophysicist Marxiwell Darismuth, who discovered and confirmed their existence. They ensure a permanent stability exists under perfect conditions, but don't guarantee that it will occur. The Universes orbiting the Darismuth Universe are called
Öonkem Universes
, named after the amateur astronomist Salim Öonkem, who predicted their existence and stability 37 years before they were proven to exist.
[

]
Since Multiverses are 4 dimensional, Öonkem Universes orbit in 4D orbits, which are much more complex to predict. These orbits are called
Öonkem orbits
.
Capture Clouds
[
]
Arrow length represents strength
Capture clouds are 3D fields of mostly positive Gaussian curvature, who's surface has forces pushing perpendicular to the curvature on any point, with the strength being proportional to the distance between it and the point directly in front of it. There are 6 different types of capture clouds, with each terminating at an imaginary sphere of twice the Universe's size consisting with a single universe, called the nucleus. Each stability point from a diagram contains 80% smaller, distinct universes, that cancel the forces out.

These forces, whilst strong enough to push entire Universes, aren't resistant to possibilities of other motions of the Universes they may capture, and as such, aren't as strong as they may seem. They are also much larger than what is pictured, and have slightly different proportions.
Universe Clusters
[
]
Rarely, some universes with almost identical laws can be packed up to form
Terminal Spheres
by a multiversal gravity force. Those spheres are now called Poosda Spheres, named after a youth theoretical physicist Sakis Poosda
[
2
]
, who proved that spheres consisting with at least 12 Universes never form in our multiverse.
Due to overlapping forces (see
Darismuth's System
), Poosda Spheres have stronger and greater capture clouds, but could mostly hold 8 - 11 Parallel Universes. Those forces caused the center universe to inflate.
All Poosda Spheres usefully become new Darismuth's Systems, when one universe inflates to a size of 300 billion light years. Then, other universes pushed out by the heavy forces from that Universe, although they will become Öonkem Universes thanks to the sudden change of capture clouds for the formation of that system.
Small universe clusters
never form in our multiverse, also proven by Sakis Poosda.
In comparison to other neighboring Multiverses
[
]
A simplistic image showing how much different the laws of neighboring Multiverses are compared to ours (in the middle). Numbers are only percentage approximates, since laws can't be simply interpreted using 1 number.
Multiverses in a Metaverse have different, but usually similar sets of laws. As one gets further away, the laws gradually become more and more different. This is not done in any pattern and this point of focus can be applies to any Multiverse in a Metaverse, whilst still retaining everything said above.
Multiverses closest to us have laws which are very difficult to discern from ours, but it becomes easier once one looks at the finer details of the quantum world. Multiverses further than that will display differences not visible easily, but ones which have larger consequences down the line (for example: Bodhea. Practically the same laws, but long time events happen much more differently). Even further than that, around midway between the edge of our Metaverse and our Multiverse, can be seen the what the general public would identify as, and envision as, different laws. By the edge of the Metaverse, one can potentially even find concepts one has never thought of before.
Lists of Universes
[
]
While there are 147,588,143 universes in our multiversal brane, only about 850,179 of them harbor life. Once again, this is due to the sensitivity of our laws. Among them, 649,702 have found a way to escape their respective universes.

History
[

The Xenonatic Bent (5.05 octillion OYC)
[
]
(See also:
Metaverse Formation
)
Before our Multiverse was formed,
our Metaverse
didn't even exist due to the simultaneous of their own formations. 20.641 billion years ago, a small portion from
the Xenoverse
's surface began to bend.
Until trillion years later, this portion kept bending more and more. Eventually, it was bending so much, that it started to cross itself, causing loops to form. Those loops grew bigger and became primordial
Metaverses
, forming a lot of Multiverses at the same time, including ours. Eventually, quadrillions of universes were formed, which frequently came together and formed
Poosda Spheres
.
The Maxxis Hypereon (5.05 octillion OYC - 1.93 octillion OYC)
[
]
Before the Maxxis Hypereon began, our Multiverse was a crossing point from
our Metaverse
. This began 5.05 octillion OYC ago, when chaotic particles collided with singularities, causing an explosion of gigantic universes. Those universes weren't stable enough, as virtual particles always collided with other universes due to the borders being really close to each other.
Dark energy and
Imaginary Energy
fueled those universes up, causing them to expand to billions, trillions or even quadrillions of light-years across! Unfortunately, almost all of those universes went through a
Big Freeze
scenario, reducing the amount from quadrillions to just hundreds of millions.
Those trigintillions (10
93
) of slow chaotic particles are now stuck in at eternity. Most laws from our nearest Multiverse was stuck there too, but then completely written in upcoming universes. There are billions of universes remain in a void, and won't happen until 1.93 octillion OYC, due to a really low presence of
Imaginary Energy
during this hypereon.
1.93 octillion OYC ago, a gravitational singularity boom occurred, creating millions of new universes. That is a significant timeframe that ends this Hypereon.
The Poosda Hypereon (1.93 octillion OYC - 623 septillion OYC)
[
]
The Poosda Hypereon began with a cluster of a lot of universes and many
Poosda Spheress
. Many universes suddenly entered the majority of Poosda Spheres during that time. Nothing happened until around 1.321 octillion OYC ago, when the centers started to inflate due to the excess of dark energy. This hypereon ended 623 septillion OYC ago, when all Poosda Spheres turned into
Darismuth's Systems
.
The Darismuth Hypereon (623 septillion OYC - present)
[
]
The Darismuth Hypereon is currently the ongoing hypereon.
