(NOT CANON) Primordium Phi (also known as P particle as in the greek letter) is a very strange particle.
It changes colors because it's a moving fractal, although very very small. It has LOTS of power with other Primordial Particles. If touched with a different Primordial Particle it will glitch it out into
Primordium Phi
. The only known combos are α+α+Ω+Φ. The name is Primordial ERROR, only a
Xoꓭ ǝʜT
sized cube is needed to glitch out of
Never
and into
Always
. As you can see it is very powerful and glitchy. The other is Primordial Deletion, a very nice particle but, only destroys stuff when they are angry, meet a bad creature, or mistaken a good creature for a bad one. They can destroy any entity, but they know all the good godly entities and bad godly entities. Those were the Complex Primordial Particle Combination(s) (or CPPC for short). The others are called Simple Primordial Particle Combination(s) (or SPPC for short). So, let's start talking about them! The first one, just is a unstable matter, but doesn't really do much, called Black Hole Matter. It's created when a black hole is created/destroyed. They get spewed out thousands of universes, and actually a good power source if split.
