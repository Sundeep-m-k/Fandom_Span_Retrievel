infinite, what do ya think
The Bowl
is just that. A very large, cosmic
bowl
that has a few Charms in it. Some twisted entities even have charm cereal. The special thing about this bowl, however, is that its material changed technology forever. When The Bowl has a piece broken off of it, it regenerates in a
Yalmeon time
. The piece broken off stays there. However, it can only be broken by Graphite, and that material is like sticks and stones for a civilization advanced enough to discover The Bowl and its Omega Porcelain, otherwise indestructible. When a civilization DOES find out graphite can break Omega Porcelain, they have access to a material nearly
10

{\displaystyle 10^7}
times as powerful as...
TREEYUM.
It would take lasers from a society spanning many, many
Zamabsoverses
to defeat Omega Porcelain ships without Graphite.
