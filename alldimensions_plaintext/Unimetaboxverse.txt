Yes I am starting an archverse chain that contains
Boxes
. I am starting with the Unimetaboxverse. It is so big, it uses things called
Cetaverse
clumps for
protons
and
neutrons
.

Cetaverse Clumps
[
]
These are clumps of
Cetaverses
.
Proclumps
[
]
These Cetaverse Clumps are used as
protons
. They have a positive charge.
Neuclumps
[
]
These Cetaverse Clumps are used as
neutrons
. They have a neutral charge.
Electroclumps
[
]
These Cetaverse Clumps are used as
electrons
. They are smaller than Proclumps and Neuclumps. They have a negative charge.
