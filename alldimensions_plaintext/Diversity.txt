A
Diversity
is a group of
Links
with vaguely similar geometry in their
Realms
. Our
Link
may seem like it has
Realms
with wildly varying geometries but because the concept of geometry only has miniscule changes throughout, our
Link
is able to become part of a
Diversity
. Diversities are spaced very far apart in their
yesph
/
nosph
, making them hard to get to and from without a lengthy trip, this means they have several permenant homes placed on them. For example, you might travel to a different
Diversity
for your honeymoon or to evade the law (Don't even think about it). Diversities are very important to any post-
Realm
civilizations just like cities are to a continental one. Sacrifice two hips and one persons joy, or as you may call it, hip hip horray for Diversities!
