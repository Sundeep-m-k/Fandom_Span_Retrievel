Lots of stuff
The Zob is a verse that houses lots of life and materials. It's protected by a thick layer of verses each housings trillions of
Protos
, binded together by a
Sentient Structure
. There is abundance in many useful materials for civilizations, such as Primordium, Glitchonicite, Toxicium, etc. These materials seem not to affect The Zob's structure. This verse also has a connection to Universe Xeon.
These creatures are called Cepsa, non-plural form being Cepsum. It's name is "Aspect" reversed without the T, with "aspect" as in Aspect Lords. Cepsa have 4 legs, with 2 toes on each. They also have 2 hands an arm, with 2 on each. They eat the fruits and berries here. They can also camoflauge to hide from outsiders.
The Sentient Structure core is in a cave filled with lots of
Ischyros Matter
, with the core itself indicated by a glowing pink light.
There are also many plants here.

Ellap Plants

Ellap Plants grow Ellap fruits on vines made of solid
Angel Matter
. Ellaps are juicy fruits in The Zob that Cepsa especially like. The name comes from "apple" except the letter keys are reversed. They also seem to be sentient, and hit against the ground or wall when a Cepsum picks an ellap from it.
