The
Sal-Ul
, also known as the
Children of the False God
, is a
race
of herbivore archangels/seraphims created by
Bood-Karr-Vav
, which were made to accompany and serve the latter during his
god
hood. The species' name literally translates into
"Angel-(minorly)"
in
Puffish
. "
Sal-Ul
" is not what the actual species name is, but is used by the
8 DIVINE GODS
.
The
Sal-Ul
live in the outskirts of the
solar system
known as
"Glitgalt-12"
(literal translation: "Chaos-Heaven-12"),
which might be inhabited by the Puffians.
Biology

A
Sal-Ul
usually stands at about 2-3 meters tall, excluding the "crowns" at the top and bottom of their main body, and the top-wing span is about 9 m. The bottom-wing span 7.5 m. when fully stretched out.
The
Sal-Ul
make a constant faint bit-crushed choir sound emanating from what seems to be the crowns and gets more louder and clear when threatened and/or provoked.
While other vanilla angels, usually those seen in monotheistic religions like Christianity, Islam, and Judaism don't seem to need to acquire food and drink to survive, the
Sal-Ul
do. So, the
Sal-Ul
usually go down to
Zoid
or any other habitable
planet
like
Earth
to pick simple fruits and vegetables and drink from a clean lake or river, then go back up to Bood-Karr-Vav's territory. The question is...how do the
Sal-Ul
eat and drink? We will never know...
Also, they can feel emotions like love, disgust, sadness, etc.
Backstory
[
]
So essentially, when Bood-Karr-Vav achieved his godhood 6 years ago, the gods before him treated him like a "tiny little baby", which is what they actually called him until
Bood-Voov-Vav
stepped in and said
"QIRR-CYUUM POL"
and escorted Bood-Karr-Vav to an undisclosed Solar System he can
rule
it all by himself. Eventually, after 1
OYC
, Bood-Karr-Vav thought
"Cl mz nb d cz..."
and decided to create the
Sal-Ul
.
