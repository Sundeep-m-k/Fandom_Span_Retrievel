Description
[
]
The corruptedverse, also known as c0rrupt3dv3rs3, is a unicue verse located in the
omniverse
, it is entirely corrupted, the time here is corrupted, the size here is corrupted, the kardashev is corrupted, everything is literally corrupted, the verse itself has sizes and time, but its corrupted so it wont' be that much of something cool.
Corrupted stuffs
[
]
Corrupted Space
[
]
the space here is corrupted, making it look like white instead of black, but green is most flashy, so there's a little white (there's still some black, but its rarely) the blackholes too, are corrupted, everything; stars, planets,galaxys, galaxy clusters.) the colors are so wierd that its like reading a japanese article to understand those colors.
Corrupted time
[
]
The time here is too, corrupted, it's not like
antiverse
, (the verse that the time there's move backwards), its time is corrupted meaning its times is different; instead of 24 hours (per / day) it's 92.6 hours for a day, close to 4 days in
earth
, but it depends on where, while its corrupting, red places are more corrupted, black are less, so in red the time is between 653 hr - 276 hr (per / day) while in black its just 92.6 hr (per / day).
Corrupted size
[
]
The size here is the same, but the size is randomly shaping, what i mean is the size can turn to a line, a triangle or even stuff like octagons or pentagons, but it will always be the same size, just not same shapes, but the size will never be else, while our universe is expanding, the corruptedverse is too glitchy to expand, the reason why it won't expand anytime soon.
Corrupted colors
[
]
(The corrupted colors won't be on "corrupted stuffs" section because It's too much to write there, so there it will be.) the corrupted colors are not only green black and white, those are a lot more, by that, there are a lot more colors; red, blue, turquoise, all of them have a meaning, so if you want to know about their meanings you can.
