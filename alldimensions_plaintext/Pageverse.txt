A Pageverse is a virtual and
artificial
bubble-like
structure
. These
verses
hold the data that makes up each existant construct in a
Wikiverse
, and in the case of our Wiki it can be either other verses,
entities
,
particles
, etc. That means Pageverses don't contain those things by themselves, but they do allow their existence nonetheless.
Pageverses may have different colors in each Wikiverse, and in this one they have a yellow color scheme.
Pageverses are usually connected to
Categoryverses
or different Pageverses with meta strings, however these connections are very loose and hard to follow.  Otherwise, they just float around in their Wikiverses.
If a Pageverse describes something badly or doesn't give enough information on something, the object may be fuzzy in the cosmology until it is made clearer by
TOGs
. The latters are the ones responsible of creating Pageverses and the constructs attached to them.
The deletion of a Pageverse by the hands of a TOG may represent the conceptual erase of the construct they hold the data of, unless its existence can be found beyond said Pageverse.
Home Pageverse
[
]
A home Pageverse is the most important Pageverse in its local Wikiverse. It has randomized and/or popular page links, a link to the discussions tab, and several other less relevant things as well.
Trivia
[
]
Pageverses are ranked as
10-C
in powerscaling terms due to being constructs made out of data, but since they're "real" (as in they're not fictional, despite the constructs they form sometimes being fictional) they may be counted as beyond fictional level instead.
There is also Blogverses, it is only available in the user's Bolg, meaning it is limited and not available in every search like Pageverse.
