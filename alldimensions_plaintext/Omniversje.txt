Omniversje

Absolute Existences

Xenoversjes
An
omniversje
(omni (all) + verse (container) + je (small)) is an infinitely big
versje
containing all
xenoversjes
that have similar fundamental physics. Because everything that could ever happen exists in an omniversje, they could be considered to be a "lesser
multiverse
" of sorts.
Like all metaversjes, it is an abstraction of reality and not actually a thing.

Xenoversjes in omniversjes are separated by displacements in higher dimensions. It is not possible to measure how many higher dimensions there are.
Any amount of virtual dimensions may be applied to an omniversje, as there would be no physical difference if it were a different amount. Since an omniversje contains every single xenoversje possible, virtual dimensions are most commonly used as a way to categorize xenoversjes based on curvature, size and other properties.
