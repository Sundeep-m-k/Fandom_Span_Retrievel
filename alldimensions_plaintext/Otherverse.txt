The
Otherverses
are small subsets of
the Other Boxes
which tightly pack together
existence-(-2)
icosahedra, mentioned in the Other Box article.
Cubic Otherstructures
often float around near the Otherverses.
Each one of these icosahedra have no existence-(-1) body to neighbour around, as they have been
stripped away from them through natural phenomena over very long periods of time.
After being stripped, they got pulled inside of the Otherverses through natural forces.
The Otherverses contain an unknown amount of,
theorized to be finite
, amount of these icosahedra each, which are extremely strongly repulsed by each other and are pushing hard against their barriers, but are unable to get out. If the barrier of an Otherverse were to be broken or busted open,
the sudden influx of icosahedra would frantically push around the near existence-(-1) objects, but wouldn't be exactly dangerous
