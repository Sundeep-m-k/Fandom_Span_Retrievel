Origins
[
]
The Barrelplockina was the result of the Barrelplockplex just floating around, and they happened to be in a barrel shape, so
Bongus
decided to create a large barrel to cover them, so he moved a bunch of Barrelplockplexes onto each other (still in a barrel shape) and covered them in a large, purple barrel. Unfortunately, this resulted in a tragic incident of death due to the fact that this chain has devolved into a string of uninteresting objects with slightly different names from each other.
