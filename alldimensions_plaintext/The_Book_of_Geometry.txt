introduction
[
]
The Book Of Geometry (aka: TBOG) is book full of geometrical art, this book contains geometrical verses. All the information below are simplified versions of the theoretical laws of all verses. These theoretical laws are written in the book, while the book can contain verses, it also contains these theories. Nobody knows that who was the person who have written this book.
What is a geometrical verse?
[
]
A geometrical verse is a verse that has a shape, form, or any verses that have an apearance similar to any of the Geometrical objects.
Symmetrical Verses
[
]
Symmetrical verses are verses that have an apearance of a geometrical object that is symmetrical, or ones that have similar apearances. The special thing about these verses, is that they're larger than most of the non-symmetrical verses.
Unstable Verses
[
]
The unstable verses are verses that will have two possible outcomes in their furure, these outcomes are called states and there is three of them; Collapsing State, Stable State and Unstable state
Collapsing Verses
[
]
Collapsing verses are verses that are currently in the Collapsing state, these verses will die out due to them overcoming the size limit of their kind. But not only verses that can extend themselfs can be in this state. There are verses that were unstable from the start, therefor they have a chance of collapsing.
Stable Verses
[
]
These verses will never possibly collapse. There is a small chance that the Unstable Verses become stable, instead of collapsing. These verses are actually very rare, due to the fact that most of the verses have have a set lifetime that is near infinity, well these Stable verses can become Unstable once again though, if they are disturbed. Then they will once again have the chance to collapse.
Eternal Verses
[
]
These verses will never change their state to being  Unstable, Stable or Collapsing. These verses are possibly the rarest, they're can't be smallerthan the Post-Loop Structures. For example all Eternalverses are Eternal.
Expanding Verses
[
]
These verses expand their; size and mass. These verses have a limit of mass and size, once they go beyong that limit they will enter the collapsing state.
Powerful Verses
[
]
These verses can expand just like expanding verses, but they have a higher limit of their mass and size. They will still enter the collapsing state when they go past the limit.
SuperPoweful Verses
[
]
These verses can expand, and they have an even higher limit of size and mass than the Powerful verses, but these verses enter the Unstable state once they go past their limit, this means that they have a small chance that they won't collapse when they cross their limit. If they become stable again, then they will no longer have a limit, meaning that they basically become eternal, but they don't have to be larger than Post-Loop Structures, to reach this state.
HyperPowerful Verses
[
]
If these verses reach their limit they will turn into a Hyper Hole.
Hyper Holes
[
]
These holes are created when a HyperPowerful Verse reaches it's limit. Then the entire HyperPowerful Verse will collapse, and turn into a Hyper Hole. The Hyper Holes now can expand by eating up verses that are larger than themselfs. These Holes also have a limit, once they reach it, they will release everthing that they have consumed, and create a gigantic explosion. The Hyper Hole that is in the state of releasing everything that it consumed, will be then once again suck in all the things that it released, and it reaches the limit once again. but this time the Hyper Hole won't survive. The Hyper Holes devastate everything, and it is possible for them to go past their limit without releasing everthing, there is a small chance that an Eternal Hyper Hole is born once a HyperPowerful Verse reaches it's limit. In this way, that Eternal Hyper Hole will continue to suck in everything.
In the Hierarchy
[
]
But how big is the size of the Book of geometry? Well, it contains every verse that is mentioned in the book. So it is larger than the Eternalverses
