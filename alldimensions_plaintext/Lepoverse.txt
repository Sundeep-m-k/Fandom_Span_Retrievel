A
Lepoverse
is a
verse
that contains
Terminal Spheres
. Our local Lepoverse is about 994.73848 trillion Light years in diameter. The
Metabubble
it is in is slightly glitched and corrupted, therefore every few hours to days, a
Terminal Sphere
within the Lepoverse will decrease by 50 km for a short period of time, usually a few seconds. It is expected that our local Lepoverse will only live for another 565 billion years, as it is already 12.5 trillion years old.
