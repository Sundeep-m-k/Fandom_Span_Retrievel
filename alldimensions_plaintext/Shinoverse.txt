Shinoverses
are some of the smallest post-
Omniverse
verses (With the
Teylomonomegaverse
being at first place, and
the 3 Planes
at second). They have a very simplistic appareance, being just green spheroids, which is something unique considering most verses are sphere-shaped. They also look opaque on the outside unlike other verses who do have a bit of transparence and/or glow.
It is stated that each one of them contains "something amazing inside of them", without any further explanation. Some say this is just a joke made by higher beings such as
TOGs
to prank the curious entities who want to discover something that does not exist in the Shinoverses, others say they could be artifacts of insane value, and some even say these are items that could power up entities, yet none of these are comprobated yet.
Trivia
[
]
Shinoverse's image and concept is taken from
this
video made by the youtuber "
DoDeca D.
", so credits to him!
Of course some extra information was made by myself due to the lack of information about the Shinoverses in the video they appeared.
