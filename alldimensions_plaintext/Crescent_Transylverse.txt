Description
[
]
The
Crescent Transylverses
are small voids containing extremely small objects. The void inside them are pitch dark, but sometimes 5 lights are visible in them. It was rumored to know that they are U.F.Os. Any communications to the U.F.Os weren't possible, as the communication signal couldn't spot the small void.
In one of the Crescent Transylverses of our local
Universe
something in its void was found. It was a planet, now known as "CT 1". Its one of the few recorded in any of these verses.
Origin

The
Crescent Transylverses
were discovered on 15 October of 2019. The origin document of them were in an iron box. The iron box was rusted close for what estimated to be 58 years. Later, the box was broke open. The document was found, but the pages in the document were all written by an average pencil from the 1898s. The pages were not visible; they were just white pages.
The only thing we know is that they're voids estimated to be -ℵ
