A
Presentron
is a decently small object which can produce many different shapes of forces, and it can also change which shape the directions of the force vectors point, into any one of a set of general recognisable shapes. They are located inside the
Rajackaskwadaverse
, and some of them are in
Orgsper and Bloughun

Sizes
[
]
Presentrons have been observed in two different sizes. The Presentrons in Orgsper and Bloughun are typically around 2.4cm in diameter, and the ones in the Rajackaskwadaverse are approximately 6.5cm in diameter. This is due to the fact that Orgsper and Bloughun is much more dense inside, having a large amount of particles per cubic unit, therefore increasing pressure. The high pressure has caused most of the Presentrons to shrink to a smaller size, but they do not shrink further because the particles in the substance they are made out of repel each other, preventing it from being shrunk any further.
Despite the difference in size, the forces in the two different Presentron types remain identical, but the smaller ones tend to be more accurate due to the lower likelihood of the physical Presentron disrupting the objects being affected by its forces.
Forces

A diagram showing the magnitude of each vector in the field. Lighter areas have a higher velocity. (Note that the field does not change according to the size of the Presentron)
Every Presentron has a three dimensional vector field, in which the vectors represent forces that push objects near the Presentron in a particular direction and velocity. The velocity of each vector stays the same, as the vectors closer to the Presentron have higher velocities than the ones further away from it. Therefore, while the velocity is not the same throughout, each individual vector's velocity remains as a constant.
The directions of the vectors depend on which "mode" the Presentron is in. The Presentron switches modes mostly randomly, although it usually switches to the one which would move objects the furthest distance at that given time.
Modes
[
]
Each mode can be seen as Vector3 function, or as a 3D coordinate function such that vectors follow the path of the surface. If a Presentron is rotated in any particular direction, the vector field will also rotate with it. The table below will list all of the possible modes the Presentron's vector fields can change to.

Direction
The Direction mode consists of a vector field in which all of the vectors point in the same direction. This means it pushes all objects of close proximity to it in the same direction (but at different velocities).
z = 0
Cylindrical
When a Presentron is in Cylindrical mode, it contains an orbital vector field which causes objects to essentially rotate around it.

Vortex
This mode is roughly parabolic, in that all vectors point in the same general direction, but not at the same rotation. This one has a couple of very specific use cases.

Catenary
This one is similar to the Vortex mode, but it follows a catenary instead of a parabola.
z = cosh(x) * cosh(y)
Attraction
All vectors point towards the middle of the Presentron, making it act like an attractor. It is typically only in this mode for a short period of time before switching to a different one.
N/A
Repulsion
All vectors point away from the core of the Presentron, making it act like a repulsor.

Purpose
[
]
The Presentrons, after changing their state, push the objects in the Rajackaskwadaverse and in Orgsper and Bloughun in many directions, in which they can remain dynamic and avoid instability. Without the Presentrons, it is likely that Orgsper and Bloughun would have separated from each other at some point.
