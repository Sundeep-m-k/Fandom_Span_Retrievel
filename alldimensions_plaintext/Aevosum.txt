Aevosum
is a constant that represents the overall “density” of existence in the Allsphere Trees. Every universe, or “dewdrop,” adds a certain amount of energy or information to the total equation. To get Aevosum, we look at all the contributions from an infinite number of hierarchies, treating each level as a separate chunk of reality. Each of the dewdrops within every level of the hierarchy adds to the whole, but thanks to a process called renormalization, the contributions don't keep piling up forever. This means that even though the Allsphere Trees are infinite, Aevosum stays a manageable, finite number.
A common question might be, “If Aevosum is constant, does that mean the Allsphere Trees never change?” That’s also not true. A constant Aevosum means we’re talking about the total structure of the Allsphere Trees at any moment, but individual dewdrops can change and fluctuate all the time. Think of it like a building that holds its shape but has rooms that shift around inside of it. Lastly, you might ask, “Can Aevosum be directly measured?” Unfortunately, no. Aevosum is more like a theoretical number that we infer from all the math. We can’t measure it directly because there’s just too much going on to see it all at once. It’s like trying to calculate the sum of every possible outcome and knowing you can never catch every tiny detail in action. But with all the math and understanding, we know Aevosum is real and it neatly ties everything together, keeping the entire infinitely branching Allsphere Trees in balance.
In our theoretical model of the Allsphere, Aevosum is introduced as a dimensionless scalar constant that quantifies the cumulative density of existence across an infinite nesting of realities. Each individual universe (or “dewdrop”) contributes a discrete unit of energy or information to the whole. We can express Aevosum mathematically as:
  Aevosum = limₙ→∞ Σᵢ₌₁ᴺₙ (Eᵢ / Pᵢ).
Here, n represents the hierarchy level within the Allsphere Trees, Nₙ is the total number of dewdrops (universes) at the nth level, Eᵢ denotes the quantized eigenvalue (representing energy or information content) associated with the ith dewdrop, and Pᵢ is the corresponding probability weight or normalization factor for that state.
This formulation is similar to how partition functions in statistical mechanics aggregate discrete states. Although each dewdrop contributes in a quantized manner, a renormalization process applied at every hierarchical level ensures that even when summing over an infinite number of contributions, the overall value of Aevosum is a finite constant.
“If the Allsphere Trees contains an infinite number of hierarchies, doesn’t that make Aevosum infinite?” it might seem that way at first glance. However, thanks to a renormalization-like damping mechanism at each hierarchical level, the contributions from ever-smaller dewdrops diminish sufficiently.
