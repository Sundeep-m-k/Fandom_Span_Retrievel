Dave
[

Dave
is a sentient entity that possesses four brain cells and lives in a Heaa. He is square-shaped and colored entirely maroon except for small white markings. He does not eat due to it being nearly impossible at his scale, but he absorbs nearby extant matter for the sake of sustenance. As of 8/1/2020, he is the second smallest known non-verse entity, but there is definitely something smaller

Omni-Holes
[
]
Omni-Hole not the hole
Omni-holes are holes where black creatures are located. Omni-holes are located in the
Omni-Cave
. Do not try to get close to one. Stay 10m away so that these creatures do not sense you. If you throw something sharp like a knife or glass or whatever on that hole, it will close, but I advise you not to do it because it is very fast in getting you into the hole, even 3 times faster than
Omni-Bears
