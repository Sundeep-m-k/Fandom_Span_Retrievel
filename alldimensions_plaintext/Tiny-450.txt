Tiny-450 is the smallest non-artifical
universe
to date. There are not many universes in the millions of light years, only 45 natural ones have been discovered. This is why giant civilizations create artificial universes to simulate how hard life might be in a Tiny-450 sized universe. Some 65
OYC
or so ago, Tiny-450 had some of its galaxies collide together. It almost destroyed the whole universe! People think it will last 6.5x10^^^^54 OYC, a record high! Why? It's because, when it comes to age, universes are just like stars. The bigger a universe is, the faster it ages, and the smaller the universe, the slower it ages.
