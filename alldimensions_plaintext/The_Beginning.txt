Story
[

Prologue
[
]
|It is one day, in one year, in one century, in one eternity, etc. like any other in a certain type of world, a
Wikiverse
.
What is a Wikiverse, you may ask? They're realms so large that even the concept of size stops making sense. Defining them as "infinite" or "endless" is an understatement too. Not even us, with our transcendence over fiction, can fully modify one of them with ease. Of course, each individual Wikiverse has its own properties: length, contents, story, etc.
The one we'll be looking at is known as the All Dimensions Wiki (AD for short), which focuses on being the container of lots of things related to cosmology.
About what the most frequent stuff that happens on AD is, it can be resumed as the constant creation and destruction of an undefined amount of verses (worlds) and entities.
This Wikiverse is also quite a chaotic one, since conflict and battles of inconceivable scale can take place anywhere and at any point in time.
That doesn't mean the whole realm is in danger, though. Incidents of even slight portions of it being at risk are almost next to none, let alone the entirety of it. Yes, the entities found here are still most of the time insanely strong, but to straight up be able to mess up something of THIS scale, where fiction starts to break down? Not even close.
Nothing can remain the same, though. Change needs to exist. What originally seemed to be a simple revenge plan caused an incredibly vast journey, where four random chosen entities would evolve and increase their strength over time, just to finally be able to fight agaisnt no other than a
Wikinomaly
, one of the strongest and (sometimes) most dangerous type of entities ever seen on any Wikiverse since they are pretty much primordial incarnations of some of their most important concepts, being around the strength of authors.
The ones chosen for this were incredibly small particles known as
Blueprint Particles
at first, which are nigh-ultimate bulding blocks of extensions of reality known as Archrealities. We could say they still work as building blocks for something, as they're the main components for the plan.
These former particles are going to be in a constant battle of trying to understand the massive world they're in, in order to use any resource they can so they can reach their target, and win.
This is the journey... to the pork.
The creation
[
]
|One. Then two. Then three. Then four.
Four tiny building blocks known as Blueprint Particles gained sentience and had their lifes started out of nowhere.
Not because of sheer randomness nor luck, but because of someone else who decided to bring them to life, because of a plan they had.
At first, these particles had to adjust their minds to this sudden event. Even though this is not the first time a Blueprint Particle has evolved into a living being, most of the time these were more gradual. In this one, the particles had a fully functional equivalent of a brain appear in them out of nowhere. At first this was quite painful (as in painfully overwhelming for their sensors) since obviously they were NOT used to having anything else other than even more basic building blocks within them.
â€”
Dang.
â€” said an entity who was watching the situation unfold, and in fact it was the ones that started all this. Even though it could notice how the particles were feeling, it didn't interrupt them just because of how oddly amusing it was to see this.
said an entity who was watching the situation unfold, and in fact it was the ones that started all this. Even though it could notice how the particles were feeling, it didn't interrupt them just because of how oddly amusing it was to see this.
Eventually the most painful / overwhelming part stopped, but the particles of course were still unable of fully adaptating to this yet. They started asking to themselves many things: "What just happened? How and why are they alive now? Why does it hurt so much? What is even going on?"
Tons and tons of new questions were appearing on their fragile new minds, and who knows if they would have imploded because of both them and the previous overload of their sensors if they weren't interrupted by the other entity who finally decided to intervene, stopping those questions from multiplying.
Introductions
[
]
â€”
Hello, little particles. Im your creator.
â€” said the other entity, known as
Idontknow350
, who is me- I MEAN one of the beings known as administrative
Transcendent Omni-Gods
(which are the avatars of the authors in the Wikiverses), aka TOGs for short. Before you ask, he shrinked himself down to a size similar to the Blueprint Particles. He is chubby and with a cyan color scheme, lacks arms so he has floating hands instead, and instead of a head he has oversized lips (without other facial features) in front of his body. He's also carrying a shotgun, for some reason.
Even after hearing him, though, the particles didn't respond, though. Something seems to be off about this...
â€”
So... are yall NOT going to say anything about this, and ignore me instead? Not even ask me about this whole situation?
|The particles STILL did not respond nonetheless. Idontknow350 was getting a bit impatient due to what was happening, which ended up making him start tweaking a bit...
â€”
Bro cmon, answer me, ts pmo ðŸ¥€
â€” It took him an embarrasing amount of time to realize that he didn't remember giving the particles the ability to speak. They were alive and conscious, but still lacked any way to communicate.
â€”
Oh... yea, I forgot that you guys can't talk yet. Sorry.
|Idontknow350 then gave them the ability to communicate, along with a slight degree of knowledge to be able to use that feature properly.
Finally, one of the particles was able to say something, and it will be known as "particle 1" for now.
â€”WHAT IS HAPPENING, WHY AM I ALIVE, WHAT IS THIS, SOMEONE HELP ME-
|Idontknow350 quickly reconfigurates the particles, since he forgot they
kinda
were suffering due to gaining sentience out of nowhere.
Now, one of the particles (which will be known as particle 1 for now) is finally able to properly communicate with him, though at first it's a bit slow at it due to being it's first words.
â€”H-hi... who are you...?
â€”
Uhm... well, im your creator, the one that gave you sentience... sorry for what just happened a few seconds ago.
â€”I guess that's okay...
â€”
So, im Idontknow350, one of the many "Transcendent Omni-Gods" in this world.
â€”Y-You dont know who?
â€”
No, my name is literally "Idontknow350".
|Lets just say... the particle didn't like the name a lot. It also started already speaking at a faster pace.
â€”Sorry, but... that name sucks.
|Idontknow350 just stared at the particle, shocked. Literally one of the FIRST things it did after getting the ability to communicate was to roast him. Imagine getting roasted by a sentient particle you created just a few moments ago.
â€”
Bro...
|Idontknow350 was both slighty sad due to the roast and surprised because one of the particles was able to grow a backbone so quickly.
Because of this, the god accidentally commited a big mistake by saying something that he shouldn't have said.
â€”
D-Do you realize you just roasted the author of the story?
|The particle was confused since it didnt know what Idontknow350 meant by that.
â€”Author of what??
|Idontknow350 quickly realized that he messed up, and tried to make it seem like what he just said was nothing of relevance.
â€”
N-Nevermind, just pretend that an author is a very powerful creator. I won't do anything bad to you even if you roast me but I'll let you know it makes me sadÂ :(
â€”I was just being honest with you, sorry. Also, what even is a "Transcendent Omni-God"?
â€”
Uhm, well... basically, super strong entities... yea...
|Thankfully for himself, the TOG managed to avoid needing to brainwash or erase the memory of the particle. They weren't supposed to know about what he had accidentally revealed. Yet.
â€”
...AAAAAND by the way, at least you're getting an actual personality. I like that, despite the roast.
|Then, another Blueprint Particle (which will be known as "particle 2" for now) finally speaks, making the conversation more interesting.
â€”So... why bring us to life?
|Idontknow350 is surprised again, because he is noticing that his newest creations are being pretty straightforward regarding the situation, just a few moments after becoming sentient.
This doesn't mean he wants to drop all the relevant information so quickly without asking, though.
The plan
[
]
â€”
...Do you want me to explain it in the "nice" or in the "honest" way?
â€”Be honest.
|Idontknow350 sighs.
â€”
Okay then. Basically you all are going to help me in a revenge plan agaisnt another entity.
â€”What does that mean?
â€”
Basically you all need to go and kill it.
|The particle didn't think that was a good idea.
â€”What do you mean?! Do you really think literal particles like us will be helpful?!
â€”
Not in your current form, obviously. I'll give you strength and abilities so you're able to do more than just exist and talk to me.
|Then, particle 1 speaks once more:
â€”Can't you just use your powers to do that by yourself? You look very powerful. Is whoever you want to take revenge on SO strong you need help?
â€”
No, I actually could beat the sh*t out of them with ease, but that'd be too easy and thus not humiliating enough.
When it realizes a bunch of particles out of all entities defeated it, I'll be there to mock it. Mock it until the end of time, and beyond that too.
|Now the third particle (AKA particle 3) is the one who starts communicating.
â€”Who is it and what did they even do to you in order for you to get THIS triggered about it?
â€”
It bothered me while I was sleeping, so it ruined my sleep session. My revenge is reasonable if you ask me.
|The fourth and final particle (AKA particle 4) finally says something.
â€”I-In my opinion it isnt...
|This one seems to be more timid than the others, though that didnt matter to Idontknow350 since he didn't appreciate that statement a lot.
â€”
Who is the one giving orders here? Me or you? Shut yo b*tch ass up lil bro.
|Particle 4 is sad now. One of the first things it hears ends up being a roast agaisnt it...
Particle 3 then speaks up again, a bit offended over what they just said to the fourth particle.
â€”Rude.
|Idontknow350 uses this moment as an excuse to "prove" he really wants revenge.
â€”
See? Im so angry about it, im already swearing at you because of it's terrible actions!
â€”Or because you can't control your feelings properly. Like bro, from what you told us it seems like it only was a minor annoyance. Get over it.
|Idontknow350 knows the particle is right, so he comes up with another excuse to make the particles accept.
â€”
You know what? That is correct... but come on, think about it: it is a completly free and entertaining trip, where you will meet a lot of new entities and get stronger over time! Isn't that exciting for you?
â€”I mean, yea. I guess it does sound interesting.
|All the other Blueprint Particles agree.
â€”
Of course it has some risk, though. I mean, I COULD revive you if one of you ends up dying, but that would make things too boring.
|Particles 1 and 3 are now concerned over their own well being. Particle 2 on the other hand...
â€”I dont care, I WANT TO FIGHT OTHER ENTITIES!
â€”
Now THAT is the spirit!
|Particle 4 isn't as eager as particle 2 with the idea that it needs to fight, though. In fact, it is not only concerned but straight up scared regarding the situation.
â€”I-I don't want to kill others... I'd feel like a monster if I did that...
â€”
I never said you'd be forced to kill anyone on sight nor something similar, don't worry. Though, there's a lot of hostile entities everywhere and you WILL need to fight back or else you'll get yourself killed in seconds.
â€”O-Okay...
|The fourth particle still seemed uncomfortable with the idea, but at least it now knew it had to be used to it. Eventually.
â€”So... who is the one that we need to find and defeat, exactly? (Particle 1)
â€”
It is known as "
block of pork
".
|The particle struggled to believe an entity really had such an absurd name.
â€”You know what? Your name isnt as bad as I thought, at least compared whatever that... thing of a name you just mentioned.
â€”
Yea, I know. Stupid name, for a stupid entity, with STUPID ABILITIES AND STUPID-
â€”Bro, chill.
|Idontknow350 sighs YET AGAIN, trying to calm down just like the particle asked him to.
â€”
Sorry. Just don't expect me to not get very angry about it sometimes. The pork MUST pay.
|The third particle goes straight to the more important questions.
â€”How strong is that "pork" thing?
|Idontknow350 is unsure regarding whether he should tell them about that part or not.
â€”
Well... this is going to be a kind of long explanation, since I got to explain a bunch of concepts beforehand, okay?
â€”Okay.
â€”
It might also be extremly concerning-
-Go ahead.
â€”
...imagine you have an endless amount of structures, and each type has a different size. The larger ones contain the smaller ones in a hierarchy-like order, sometimes having a beyond infinite size difference bethween them. After a certain bunch is grouped, they get indexed together as something known as a "class". Structures from higher classes are, obviously, far larger than ones from lower ones. Theres an infinite amount of normal classes, THEN add +1 to that. Basically class infinity+1, AKA meta class 1.
â€”I don't get it... is the entity you mentioned ABOVE that...?
â€”
Yea, kind of... it can destroy early meta-class 1 structures...
â€”And... what class are WE in, in terms of strength...?
|Idontknow350 would be blunt with the next thing he was about to say.
â€”
You're in class -1.
|Particle 2 started to regret what he said because of what Idontknow350 just mentioned, so it replies:
â€”DUDE, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO WIN???
|Idontknow350 tries calming his creations down without using some brainwash ability.
â€”
You don't, not yet at least. That's why I said you will take the journey, so you can get stronger and finally confront your target properly.
â€”Couldn't you, like, give us the strength instantly? You could still mock it afterwards since we technically would be the ones that defeated it. (Particle 1)
â€”
Too easy, not as satisfactory.
â€”It just sounds like you're using us as simple entertainment.
â€”
It can also hear all of us anywhere, all the time.
â€”Does that matter if we still beat it afterwards after we get hyperbuffed by you?
â€”
Bro, stop, im the one doing the story. Not you.
â€”What story?
|The Transcendent Omni-God is really starting to get annoyed, because the particles are turning out to be WAY too sentient for his taste.
â€”
Bro, just shut up, you're asking too many questions. Let me do something REAL quick instead.
Gifted powers
[
]
|Idontknow350 then proceeds to change the morphology of the particles, increasing their size (now they're ~1 meter tall) and making them look more like blobs with floating hands rather than particles.
Each entity also had gotten a design slighty different from the rest, so it's easier to tell who is who. NÂ°1 has a dark grey color scheme, NÂ°2 a red one, NÂ°3 a grey one (slighty brighter than NÂ°1's) and with a metalic-looking surface and NÂ°4's color scheme changed gradients over time.
Idontknow350 quickly speaks up before any of his creations can say anything about this, so they don't interrupt him.
â€”
Before you say anything, yes, I know I just buffed yall in strength and size right now. It's only because otherwise, you simply won't be able to even start. So... what do you think of your new forms?
â€”I mean... it's o-okay, I guess... (Particle 4)
â€”50/50. (Particle 3)
â€”Mid. (Particle 1)
â€”I expected something more menacing... (Particle 2)
|Idontknow350 casually ignores all entities except NÂ°1, trying to convince him (yes, they now have genders) that the transformation wasn't "mid".
â€”
You call it mid only because you don't know that both you and the others just got new abilities along with the other upgrades.
â€”Really? (Particle 1)
â€”
Yep, and I can even describe all of them shortly and give yall a name based around them.
â€”PLEASE don't make the names embarrasing. (Particle 3)
|Idontknow350 then spends a few seconds trying to figure out somewhat good names for each, or at least ones that don't straight up suck.
â€”
The red one's ability is to get stronger when he gets angrier / more determined. Pretty much plot armor, so im calling him Plotty.
â€”What is plot arm- (Plotty)
â€”
STOP ASKING THINGS.
|Idontknow350 is really getting tired of fumbling his own story just because of not paying enough attention to what he himself is saying.
â€”
Oops... my bad.
|An uncomfortable silence extends for several seconds after what just happened.
â€”So... what about me? (Particle 3)
â€”
Well, since you seem to be the smarter one of the group, you've been granted a lot of technology-related abilities which you will eventually learn to master. Im calling you Roko.
â€”How is that even related to me?
â€”
It originally is part of the name of a theory centered about a very smart robot that basically turns into a singularity. Take it as a compliment.
â€”Are you implying you turned me into a robot?
â€”
Kind of. Just look at your own body, it now has a metalic texture.
|A few seconds then pass, in which Idontknow350 is waiting for another creation of his to ask about their changes, which obviously does end up happening.
â€”...Can you talk about me now? (Particle 1)
â€”
Yep. This may sound odd, but your powers are related to the corruption and anti-corruption of things.
â€”What does that mean?
â€”
You can "hack" entities or structures and imcrease or decrease their spatial stability. Basically, you can glitch things out of existence. Im naming you Corrus.
â€”Why?
â€”
"Corr" as a short for "corruption", and "us" simply to make it feel more like a proper name for an entity.
And, for my last creation, you pretty much rely on special abilities which you'll learn over time. Doesn't mean you're weak physically though. I'll name you Fugax.
|Particle 4 / Fugax finds the name a bit odd af first.
â€”F-Fugax?
â€”
It means "shy" on another language. Fitting and sounds cool, isn't it?
|Now that Fugax understands it, she starts to appreciate it more.
â€”It does sound good, thank you...
|Plotty then interrupts Fugax.
â€”Do we start the trip now?
â€”
Not yet, I need to explain one more thing.
â€”This is taking forever. (Corrus)
â€”
You won't know what to do if I don't tell you.
â€”Fine, go ahead.
â€”
Even though I said it can hear us, that doesn't mean it physically exists, not right now at least. It needs to be manually summoned for it to do anything else other than spectate and appear in dreams.
â€”So your intention is for us to spawn it, then kill it right after?
â€”
Yep. And in order to do so, you need to gather nine artifacts known as "raw porkchops", which are roughly shaped like ovals with uneven edges and rounded corners, and have a red and pink shade.
|(This is how they look like)
Don't worry if you can't remember all those details though, I made it so Roko's technology can detect them.
|Roko gets really confident after hearing this.
â€”Does that mean im the best in the group? (Roko)
â€”
The best tool.
â€”...
â€”
It's a joke.
â€”I-I know.
|Plotty then interrupts the conversation AGAIN.
â€”Do we start traveling now?? (Plotty)
â€”
Dude, stop asking. But yea, yall are starting now. The porkchops are scattered across our whole realm though, which is known as the Wikiverse, a Meta-class 1 structure. For now, I'll manually teleport yall close to them, but soon you'll gotta do it by yourself.
â€”
By the way, if you see giant flying beasts on the world im about to send you to, fight them.
â€”What do you mea- (Corrus and Roko)
|Idontknow350 then teleports them to this "new world", known as a
Fleshverse
.
The journey finally begins. The journey... to the pork.
