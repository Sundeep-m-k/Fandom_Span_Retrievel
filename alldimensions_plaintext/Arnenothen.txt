Early life
[

Arnenothen was created near a Torubarrier at
−
Ω

{\displaystyle -\Omega_2}
BE
[

]
, as the Artoths passed the barrier. They were immediately interested in Artoth texts and Artoth calligraphy, as well as wormhole creation. This would spark much of what was to come, and Arnenothen had their mind set on using wormholes to possibly get through
the Metahyperchain
, as it was happening.
Wormholes
[
]
Arnenothen pitched their idea of using wormholes to get out of the Metahyperchain, and the High Committee accepted the idea. Wormholes, or what literally translates to 'instant transport tunnels' in Artoth, were installed by Arnenothen and their colleagues. The wormholes did allow for escape from the Metahyperchain, and as a reward, the High Committee promoted them to the Wormhole Supervisor, and Arnenothen led their path further into the physics side of things.
Entrance into the End of Chain
[
]
When entering into the End of Chain, the most advanced Artoth technology detected that it had a Kardashev of around
Π
Ω
Ω
{\displaystyle \Pi^{\Omega}_\Omega}
, although this was an understatement. The Aroths began working on the 1 of 6 main goals, being
Recourse Gathering,
Education,
Construction,
Exploration,
Economic,
and finally, Portech, for making wormholes for transport.
Obviously, Arnenothen worked on Portech, and supervised and invented many new kinds of wormholes. The Ancient Escape ship finished construction.
Stuck in the End of Chain

Main part:
Arnenothen
(in End of Chain)
If you read the page on the
End of Chain
, you would have seen that Arnenothen was working on a last-minute Portech project when it failed and they missed the launch. Arnenothen was stuck for a very long time, and they read almost all the scripts in Remnants of Civilization. We entered and found them, and we are getting very close to where we are now.
SAV exploration
[
]
Arnenothen also explored some of the
Strong Axiomatic Verse
, and they were very helpful to make initial communications between Artoths, basically being a translator.
Current
[
]
Arnenothen is now working on translating Ancient Scripts to languages that we can understand, and are now practicing their interests in calligraphy.
Almost a
Vsaue
in power?
[
]
Yes, this is true, and not an error. Artoths are unique in that they can release all of their information in one large, deadly burst. Being that Arnenothen may be the most intelligent Artoth, and almost have the power of one
Λ
{\displaystyle \Lambda}
. This, however, removes all known information from that Artoth, and is also highly illegal in Artoth law, with punishments of being completely reduced to
protoverse
and
Kappa Particle
dust.
Because of this, Arnenothen
could
do something with a power of 0.9314
Λ
{\displaystyle \Lambda}
, but it would be so bad for them in multiple ways that they obviously wouldn't do it.
