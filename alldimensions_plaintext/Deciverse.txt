The
Deciverse
is a smaller
archverse
usually contained by the
Universes
. Unlike other verses the Deciverse does not build the foundations of a universe but instead just exist there. Deciverses have pretty much the same laws as the universe they’re in and if not in a universe then they have they’re own seperate laws.

Deciverses form from a Medium Bang, which is a big bang with not enough energy to grow to the size of an average Universe but Medium Bangs happen more commonly though. it is speculation that the B.O.A.T (Brightest Of All Time) is a Medium Bang.
Types
[

Deciverses can be categorized into 2 types, Open and Closed. Open Deciverses (LNB of 1,1,0) have no border so objects from the Deciverse and Universe can go in to one another and vice versa. But a major difference is that since Deciverses have more matter in a smaller area the gravity of a Deciverse can be multiple times stronger than the universe they’re in. This was we can see if were in a Deciverse or not. A Closed Deciverse (LNB of 1,1,1) on the other hand has a border which doesnt allow the freedom of moving in and out of it, though Closed Deciverses are quite rare and most universes dont have a Closed Deciverses within them.
There are an estimated 5-25 Deciverses within our universe and some supermassive cosmic structures we know like the Laniakea Galactic Supercluster might be just the center of an Open Deciverse.
