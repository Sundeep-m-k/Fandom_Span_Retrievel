Random objects
The
Objectsverse
is a huge verse with random objects everywhere. There can be normal things, like stars, planets, black holes, nebulae, space debris, and galaxies, but there also can be extremely strange things like pencils, crayons, pieces of plastic, tissue paper, porcelain, and random other stuff. The species on the Objectsverse's planets are Object Show characters, blocklings, humans and Nobezian species.

Structure
[
]
The structure of the Objectsverse is quite unnoticeable, since there really doesn't seem to be any structure at all due to the seemingly random placement of objects in the Objectsverse.
Actually, different types of objects are sorted based on the concentration of helium in each object. No one knows why the sorting is based off of that.
Number of helium atoms
Where placed
<10 atoms
The object will be placed on the outer edge of the Objectsverse.
10 ~ 100
The object will be placed close to the center of the Objectsverse.
100 ~ 10,000
The object will be placed in roughly in between the outer layer and the center of the Objectsverse.
10,000 ~ 10^20 moles
The object will be placed right next to the core of the Objectsverse.
>10^20 moles
The object will be recycled in a black hole.
Normal Objects
[

Core
[
]
The Objectsverse has a core at its center. This core is metallic, and has quite a strong gravitational pull. This core also seems to give off unusual amounts of radiation, and due to the radiation there is no life on or inside the core.
Just like the Objectsverse, the core inside of it is also completely spherical. The core is, for some reason exactly 100 LY across, and is the biggest known object inside of the Objectsverse. The core seems to be anchored at its current spot, and all attempts to move the core around have failed.
Planets
[
]
There are also many planets in the Objectsverse. Almost all of these planets do not have any life, and most habitable planets were already recycled in a black hole due to the many helium atoms in their atmospheres. For the planets that remain, virtually all of them have no atmospheres, and for the extremely small fraction of planets that do have life, the life is always microscopic.
These planets can vary in size quite a bit.
Stars
[
]
The stars in the Objectsverse are mostly regular stars. Many of the stars in the Objectsverse resemble Class U stars from the
Energyverse
and Class O stars from a typical
Universe
. Most of these stars have planets orbiting them, but most planets are very small and are usually just considered space rocks.
Nebulae
[
]
The Objectsverse also has many nebulae. These nebulae are almost always slower than typical nebulae in other verses, and most are small as well. These nebulae usually only produce at most 15 stars per thousand years, which is very slow.
Black Holes
[
]
There are many black holes in the Objectsverse. Many are only at most 50 stars dense, and usually do not harm the planets, stars, nebulae, galaxies, or any other object nearby. The only time when the black holes suck matter in are when an object has too much helium, in which they will get sucked into a black hole.
Galaxies
[
]
Most of the stars in the Objectsverse are coalesced into a galaxy. These galaxies usually do not have a black hole at their center, and are usually elliptical galaxies. Individual, separate galaxies are quite hard to find, and only 18 separate galaxies have been found in the entire Objectsverse.
Some of the not-so-normal Objects
[
]
Tissue Paper
[
]
Since the Objectsverse has a bunch of random objects, it will of course contain something like tissue paper. This tissue paper seems to be very low quality, and they do not come in tissue paper boxes. Some of these tissue papers have been stained with something unknown to the
First Realm
as of yet.
Pencils
[
]
There have been sightings of pencils floating around the Objectsverse. These pencils are not branded, and are most likely homemade. All of these pencils have very dull tips, and have been coated in some white paint.
Pieces of plastic
[
]
Pieces of plastic have also been found in the Objectsverse. This pieces of plastic are usually always extremely dirty, and most pieces discovered have an irregular, pointed shape.
Crayons
[
]
The crayons in the Objectsverse... shouldn't be counted as crayons. They are made out of some strange pigment, and just like the pencils, aren't branded. These crayons have found to be very bad at coloring on paper, but very good at coloring on metal, plastic, and styrofoam.
Glitchonicite
[
]
There seems to be traces of
Glitchonicite
in the Objectsverse. The amounts measured are astronomically small, but the Glitchonicite could cause problems to the surrounding objects and the Objectsverse itself.
Relationship with the first
Coververse
[
]
The Objectsverse is very peculiar in the fact that it has the remains of a
Coververse
surrounding it. Studies showed that this Coververse was the oldest one ever discovered, all the way back in 216
OYC
. Another strange thing is that this extremely old Coververse seemed to have consumed other Coververses and then expanding until it eventually ripped, destroying the Coververse. This meant that the first Coververse got destroyed right when the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and later Coververses were created.
It is unknown if the Objectsverse had anything to do with this.
