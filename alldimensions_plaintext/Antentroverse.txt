Entroverse
An Antentroverse can be entered when entropy inside of an
Entroverse
causes an inhabitant to be transported to an Antentroverse. Antentroverses are exact opposites to
Entroverses
, as they have the same size but negative, and absolutely no entropy at all unlike the impossibly high entropy of an
Entroverse
.
Everything in here stays the same and will always stay the same. Nothing moves, nothing speaks, nothing happens. The temperature also stays the same, and so do its other properties such as shape and life percentage.
There are a few strange objects that are in a static position throughout the Antentroverse, and they have been confirmed to be life forms, except they can't do anything due to the absence of entropy. The size of these lifeforms is exactly -0.02466 Planck lengths.
