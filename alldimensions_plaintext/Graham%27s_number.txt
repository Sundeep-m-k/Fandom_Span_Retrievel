Graham's number is one of the biggest numbers ever used in a constructive/practical way. It uses Knuth uparrow notation.
Definition
[
]
Graham's number uses the
G
function, with
G
64
{\displaystyle G_{64}}
being Graham's number.
G
1
{\displaystyle G_1}
would be
3
↑

↑
↑
3
{\displaystyle 3 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3}
. This number alone is ridiculously big, and is pretty much unimaginable. However,
G
2
{\displaystyle G_2}
would be
3
↑
⋯
G
1
⋯
↑
3
{\displaystyle 3 \uparrow \cdots G_1 \cdots \uparrow 3}
.
G
3
{\displaystyle G_3}
would be
3
↑
⋯
G
2
⋯
↑
3
{\displaystyle 3 \uparrow \cdots G_2 \cdots \uparrow 3}
, and so on until
3
↑
⋯
G
63
⋯
↑
3
{\displaystyle 3 \uparrow \cdots G_{63} \cdots \uparrow 3}
, which is
G
64
{\displaystyle G_{64}}
.
Graham's number can also be represented like this:
