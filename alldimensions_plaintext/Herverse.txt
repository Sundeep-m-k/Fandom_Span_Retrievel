What is the Herverse?
[
]
The herverse is the container to the Sverse and it’s other parts. Most
"Star”s
are located here and other planets, moons, stars and the
Semi Group
is where rouge verses in here go to reside. It’s because of Sverse, its gravity cause verses to cuddle up in tight spaces, as shown in the picture. This verse is barely populated, but most civilizations in here are type 2’s as being able to control solar systems.
Why is gravity different in the center and edges?
[
]
Like I said before, Gravity is stronger at the cores, but did you know they are stronger at the edges as well?
The entire hierarchy has the same effect, because the atoms are tightly packed and squeezed at the same time, it allows nobody to pass through, expect for teleportation. Only the inner middle parts of the verse are safe.
Why is this verse unstable?
[
]
This verse although has strong gravity to keep itself from collapsing, the verses in here don’t fuse into one verse. Why? it’s because while there is gravity in the center, inner middle and edges, there almost isn’t in the outer middle. This is where the Semi Group resides.
Colorops
[

Colorops divide the
Herverse
into three parts, so does the Subops in this verse.
Different colors

Each Colorops has its own colors and physics inside them, The Blueops, the colorops,
Onie
