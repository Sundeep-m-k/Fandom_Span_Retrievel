The Alephiverses are a group of 7 verses that form the
Alephiverse
. The Alephiverses are split into 2 sections;
Microscopic
and
Macroscopic
. Their size is measured using
Alephifinite Power
.

The Alephion is a Sub-
Alephitomic
particle that makes up
Alephitoms
. They are essentially the quarks of the Alephverses. Its size is equal to 𐌰
Ω
. Many civilizations who have conquered their local Alephion have thought that they had conquered everything.

The Alephicule is the final Microscopic Alephiverse. It is a chain of around 𐌰
𐌰
𐌰
𐌰
𐌰
Ж
Alephitoms
. It is the molecule of the Alephiverses. It is also the median of the 7 Alephiverses (excluding the
Alephiverse
itself). Currently, our civilization can travel the Alephicule in under 1 Alephisecond (The reciprocal of the number 𐌰
1
).
