, you guessed it, stores Information with its core. It stores it using some unknown ways. Even tough there are bigger things, they aren't nowhere as powerful as the

Energy Lasers
[
]
Believe it or not, energy Lasers are needed. If it left uncharged, it'll discharge.
But not too much. If it fed too much, it'll overcharge and explode.
Data loss
[
]
If the power drops to 75%, it'll run the risks of data loss.
In 75%, it's the game of chance. Get unlucky, then you disappear.
In 50%, things are much worse. After 1 freezed seconds, the random one disappeared.
In 25%, it erases 1% of the information every 1k
OYC
.
In 1%, it's the chosen one game. If you're lucky, you could be the chosen one and don't disappear.
At 0%, The information core disappears. Thus, losing all data.
You can tell whether or not TIC contains Information by its colour. White is no information and cyan is full of information.
The Rings
[
]
TIC can contain multiple rings.
0 rings
[
]
With 0 rings, TIC is completely useless.
1 ring
[
]
1 ringed TIC is the type that most TIC uses.
2 rings
[
]
With 2 rings, it quickly jumped from Tiny (TIC R1) to Small.
3 rings
[
]
With 3 rings, it already jumped straight to Class 2 of the Post-Meta Hierarchy
4 rings
[
]
But with most things, it can suddenly slow down. It is the size of TIC 3R * TIC 2R.
5 rings
[
]
But it gradually sped up. Size = TIC 5R ^^ TIC 4R
6 rings
[
]
Then it really speed up.
10 rings
[
]
10 rings is the normal maximum of TIC. Going more rings require you to replace energy lasers to the yellow one.
1000 rings
[
]
Then it quickly sped up.
10^10 rings
[
]
This is to the point that yellow lasers couldn't keep up. Thus, using the green lasers.
10^10^10 rings
[
]
But, it's not for long. You need Rainbow Lasers.
10^^10 rings
[
]
Rainbow Lasers are doing great! But, the size per rings slowed down.
10{10}10 rings
[
]
Rainbow Lasers still kept up.
∞ rings
[
]
It's to the point Rainbow Lasers couldn't keep up.
