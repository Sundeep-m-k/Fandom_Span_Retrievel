About 1.2
OYC
old
Size
15 meters tall
Goals
None. Didn't really ask for the power.
Species
Puffian God-like entity
Bood-Karr-Vav
is a
god
that is still partially Puffian in mind. He owns the
race
of the
SAL-UL
. His name translates to "The Fake God" in
Puffish
. Despite his name being in the aforementioned language, he's NOT one of the
8 DIVINE GODS
.
Note: Bood-Karr-Vav is still a young god, so don't get any ideas about "pleasing" him.
Biology
[
]
Bood-Karr-Vav is approximately a 15 meters tall
entity
, excluding the tail. Bood-Karr-Vav seems to be based off of axolotls, seemingly because of the tail and "crown" of Bood-Karr-Vav himself. The triangle looking thing in the torso of him seems to be the source of his power and is full of
Trancendium
,
True Trancendiums
and
Abosolute Trancendiums
. Even though most Trancendium types are green or rainbow, the core is a purplish color. The purple crown material most of the body are very sharp, and he
will
use them when provoked.
Origins
[
]
Bood-Kar-Vav was a normal Puffian about 1
OYC
ago, when suddenly a mad scientist decided to kidnap the soon-to-be-god. As the scientist kidnapped the boy, he experimented with the
particles
that he has in his creation, specifically Trancendium. He made the boy consume the matter, and soon, well, the boy melted.
"that's one more body blob to take care of..."
But after the body was thrown into space
(because why not)
, for some reason the young Puffian revived
(could be the Trancendium, or one of the gods? or both???)
, causing Bood-Karr-Vav to be born.
But alas, he was
small.
And so, he decided to eat some
Blueprint Particles
, then one
Primordium Delta
, which oddly is a rare delicacy. After some time, he was the size of a normal Puffian, if not bigger.
Abilities
[
]
Mandelbrot Manipulation
- Bood-Karr-Vav is able to manipulate Mandelbrot sets and similar
fractals
in any shape or form. For example, he can turn
Alphasms
into a Mandelbrot set, or make one for him instead, or use a Mandelbrot set as a portal, etc. The possibilities are endless.
Cartoon Logic
- Bood-Karr-Vav has the properties of a Looney Toons character, so he can grab a comically large hammer, and smash his enemies, or he can paint a landscape he can pass through, but others can't.
