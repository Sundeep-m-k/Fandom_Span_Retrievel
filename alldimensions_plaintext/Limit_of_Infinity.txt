The
Limit of Infinity
is a verse that, despite the name, does not have a size that is the actual 'limit of infinite numbers', because this is not a well-defined value.
Instead, this verse is composed of two kinds of 'infinities' that are beyond all cardinals and ordinals. These two kinds of infinities are called
ordered infinities
and
corrupt infinities
. Ordered infinities are breaks between the chaos of the corrupt infinities, and math as we know it still makes sense. However, in corrupt infinities, math itself begins to break down as these infinities can cause paradoxes and physical properties just by visualizing them. Corrupt infinities contain
Œ∏
.
The space in-between these infinities seems to be a break into a physical reality, and this allows the infinities to actually fit into a size that is not absolutely infinite, but it is still extremely large, with a size of around

Ordered Infinities
[
]
Ordered infinities seem to be relatively safe to enter (although they don't have a very well-defined barrier), as most laws and axioms inside are not broken. However, be warned that anything that enters will be converted into a semi-abstract, semi-physical state which has been described as "being able to know what the idea of a number actually is". This state is sometimes called 'abphysical', and will be referred as such for the rest of the page.
This contrasts the
Limit of Numbers
, which when entered, still keeps a physical state but all thoughts are filled with certain abstract topics.

Abphysical States
[
]
The abphysical state does not appear to contain any particles (unless they are extremely small), although it does allow for consciousness and certain types of machinery to work. Things do not have solid shapes and sometimes are missing physical properties (like dimensionality or size). These abphysical states are similar to how some particles in
Class -2
are partly physical and abstract at the same time. More research is needed to determine how these connect to each other, although existing tests have shown that the interactions of particles with ordered infinities are very similar to the interactions between particles and
Axions
.
Corrupt Infinities
[
]
Corrupt infinities are much more dangerous than ordered infinities, as when something is in a physical or abphysical state many things become unstable or have multiple values at once, although verses it contains seem to have a barrier to return to a physical state. Some axioms and laws break down at this level (depends on the corrupt infinity), causing a journey through to be dangerous and not recommended.
