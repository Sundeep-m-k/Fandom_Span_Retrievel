You thinked it really was the end? No. This is less than the 0% of
The Meta-Hierarchy
. You cant, you just REALLY cant imagine how long this will be.
Even when you hit the 100% of
The Meta-Hierarchy
, there will be infinite more hierarchies, or even more than infinity. Maybe, even if we skip more than infinity layers, theres still more way. Your going to be in the hierarchies for infinite years.
Like other hierarchies and there is infinite more then it repeats forever (the quote will go on forever) (and there is infinite quotes) Like
The Cosmic Truth
(and repeating
The Cosmic Truth
infinitely) (and then it's the ultimate loop and it will still repeat forever and forever amount of times which is forever) (you probably know this is going to repeat forever and it will repeat forever forever) (you probably get what I'm talking about and if not you are considered a idiot) and there is no end and it repeats more than infinite and no
cosmic entities
can comprehend the End-All-Be-All and it repeats forever and repeats forever and that repeats forever and that also repeats forever forever infinite more forevers (infinite more forevers x biggest numbers x beyond infinite times of (you probably know this is going to repeat forever and it will repeat forever forever with even more infinite and beyond and everything you can imagine and not imagine.)
