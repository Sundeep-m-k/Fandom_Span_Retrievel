(Svki included)
POV: the Jamie alliance
The Jamie secret alliance is an alliance/army/squad formed by
Jamieyangletian12345
because he was having problems dealing with his enemies, they had even created an army so that they could defeat me but they didn’t know that I had secretly created an alliance to fight back against them, so I created my own army with the strongest people I  knew. The Jamie secret alliance was not formed for fun, but for revenge and Jamie knows that his enemies are cooked because the Jamie secret alliance is the mot powerful alliance ever. The Jamie secret alliance are currently fighting another army called QUACK QUACK DUCK SOCIETY, The Jamie secret alliance is made to DESTROY that army and fight back easily. It is so influential too that the Jamie Secret Alliance is the only thing standing between midnight and the current time on the Doomsday Clock.
Members of the Jamie secret alliance and what they could do:
[
]
- The Bald kid
The bald kid is so powerful that universally destructive things would happen if the bald kid accidentally think of that, 1 slap from him could get a whole verse extinct and with his full power he can stop making everything existing things be existing by just doing nothing at all because he the bald kid, the most powerful kid that is bald. Able to implode millions of omniverses by accidentally thinking of that happening is already 0.001% of what he can do and has a very mysterious type of strong power that nobody knows about.
- Hugo boss
Hugo boss is known for being the one with lifting strength in the whole alliance, he can lift the whole metaverse with his hair and can the metaverse would explode from feeling the aura of Hugo boss’s hair, making his lifting strength so powerful that he wouldn’t even get aa chance to lift it, it would explode from his aura.
- Hunter boss
Hunter boss, the special forces soldier that can snipe some one that is decillion of light years away and not only he is good at using a gun but he has 0.8x the strength of the bald kid which is already enough to implode Billions of verses by accidentally touching it.
- The Fat Kid
The fat kid is also the strength in this team with Hugo boss and the bald kid because he had a tragic backstory that made go on a diet and started working out and became stronger than he ever was, he can blink his eyes and countless of multiverses gets shredded from the destruction.
- Jamies older cousin
Jamies older cousin isn’t really the strength in this group but rather the brains of the group, his manipulation is so powerful that he can make tons of Omni verses collide if he just manipulates them, he can make non existent things get manipulated and obeys his thoughts.
- Ben
Ben is Jamies friend at school that also has the same enemy as him, Ben is like a technology guy that can invent techs that can implode galaxies in one shot which makes Ben the tech guy of this alliance.
There are 10 more friends that are in the group and more special forces members but I don’t know a lot about them so unfortunately I can’t explain the rest of the members of the Jamies secret alliance.
Weapons:
[
]
- The red button
- The orange button
- Power bullets (hunter bosses bullets)
- Bens technologies
Enemies:
[
]
-Tom (enemy)
Tom is a freaking psycho that almost killed me (Jamieyangletian2345), While we used t be friends I slowly started noticing that his actions are literally like a freaking psycho. While me and my family and Tom we were on a small boat, he started going insane and tried to make the boat sink so that all of us would die, making him one of my biggest enemies ever. I was scared to visit him again but the bald kid would be the one that would help me destroy tom.
-The bald kids sister (enemy)
This is another enemy that the bald kid would protect me in because the bald kids sister is almost pure evil and whenever I disagree with her, she would punch, bite and slap me with full force but whenever the bald kid saw that then he would hit his sister so hard that it almost seems like abuse and Making her a very big enemy to the Jamie secret alliance.
-Edward(enemy)
Edward literally raged at me because I passed to Krishh instead of him during football and he rages at everything even when he died in 99 nights in the forest because he didn't DO anything at all and I had to do all the work and he blamed me for not protecting him but I DID by building a wall of logs around him and he got picked up by the owl so it wasn't my fault he died, he could've just stopped being AFK and fucking jumped out of the hole I built him. Worst of all, I'm actually not the one writing this paragraph, it was Edward PRETENDING to be me(although I edited it later), that is the kind of person he is, despicable.
-The Chef(main enemy)
The Chef chopped up the Sussy Dog.
-The quack quack duck society (main enemy)
The quack quack duck society is definitely the biggest threat to the Jamie secret alliance because it was the main enemy of the Jamie secret alliance. Although the quack quack duck society isn’t the most evil out of those people but they are a bigger threat because they have a whole army to fight. Jamieyangletian12345 used to be a member of that group but they
The quack quack duck society logo
The Quack Quack duck society logo]]ditched him and became enemies, but unfortunately at time, I was outnumbered and outmatched so I definitely couldn’t defeat them. Quack Quack duck society is known for a group of 12 year olds that are forced to pretend to be ducks.
There was 2 people named Eu had and Eugene was the boss of the quack quack duck society , Although I don’t have beef with Eugene but eu has was one of my biggest enemies ever because he always would punch people and even injured
Mrhappymonyet
in real life as well
I went to china and had a talk with the bald kid about the quack quack duck society and he offered to help me, Hugo boss, Hunter Boss, the fat kid and many other friends there wanted to help me because they found quack quack duck society very evil so I decided to form a secret alliance and obviously the quack quack duck society is cooked because The Jamie secret alliance literally has soldiers from the Chinese special forces.
Although quack quack duck society (the main enemy) has created many imaginary powerful ducks that are really strong and here is the full story:
QUACK QUACK DUCK SOCIETY
[
]
Ok, you have to survive in eastern Antarctica for a month without anything, beat all ten of our alpha male ducks, solve a very hard mystery before all 100 hundred of our secret agents working together solve it first, and also step foot in my house in order to join the quack quack duck society.
The ten alpha males are Jacob strongman, Adam Lewante, Casio Linda, Collins quacker, Mr Abrigato, Adam the great, Thenes stronghold, yoleb cristanio and Alexander soon. They all are super strong with the strongest biceps in the observable universe. They speak duck language that only I can understand
“Quack” is “hello”
“Quack” but a tiny bit higher pitch is “please”
Quack with a low pitch is “no”
Quack but with a broken pitch is “why” in a sad way
Quack with a high to low pitch is “why” in a great way
The quack quack duck society is always open to everyone that is willing to take on the challenge to join the quack quack duck society
It’s also selling miracle quail egg yolks and a bottle of the miracle water from the miracle lake at a cheap price of 100 thousand duck coins each purchase
1 duck coin equal to 5.89 ringgit
By the way all the alpha males have a “Lee or Pang” as their last name
Also Jacob strongman lee is willing to fight anyone that passed the first test in surviving Antarctica and you can win a cheap price of 101 thousand duck coins if you beat him
It’s a special challenge that have no affect on the challenge to  join the quack quack duck society
Everyone here in this society except for me, the boss, is a gigachad and has powerful and thick biceps brachii, triceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis in the eternity of the observable universe
To be simple and precise, all the ducks here are gigachads with strong biceps stronger than your army
Also you have to fight the strongest duck in our society
His name is Jacob strongman lee
And there are also some female alpha ducks as well
And then they marry and give birth to 1 billion ducks
And btw my friends also is part of it
100 million of them are gigachad soldiers
So all the alpha males are under my surname
I have a total of ten alpha males
And they give birth to more gigachads but not alpha males
My ducks can live for a “sex”gintillion years
Also break this code please please please it’s the passcode for my safe: 1234567890 [] [=] |||||||||| 1010100101001010 = 2
Drinking milk helps me to sleep well because it contains an anime acid called tryptophan and it has an effect on our human body that helps us to be calm and happy removing the bad thoughts in our mind the reason tryptophan can do that because it increases the production of serotonin and melatonin in our body which are natural sleep regulators that allow us to sleep quickly and peacefully and it’s basically the opposite of caffeine so drinking milk on a daily basis can help us to have a better day and life every day
Oh the quack quack duck society does not drink milk
Yeah it sometimes steal flamingo milk to drink because it’s delicious for them not me
It at a place called the lake of wisdom and legacy
It at somewhere in Malaysia
Somewhere in KL
In the jungle
Oh wait not KL it’s in pahang
Yeah I have a squad in antartica
I don’t have the address because there is no GPS and it look too normal it have water a trees like that
I looks like a normal lake
The duck city is underwater
It 8 km underwater
Only people and animals with the quack quack duck passport is allowed to enter
Also I actually never visited before
Because the water pressure at down there is 100 times the air pressure of Venus and feels like a hundred elephants squishing you.
The Quack quack duck society(main enemy) original story:
[
]
In the enchanting wetlands of Quackington, a vibrant community known as the Quack Quack Quack Duck Society thrives, where three quacks are more than just a means of communication—it's a way of life. Led by the Quack Council, consisting of wise elders Quackle, Quibble, and Quillbert, ducks gather around the shimmering Trillium Pond to celebrate their unique triple-quack culture.
Every year, the society hosts the grand "Quack Trio Festival," a spectacle where ducks showcase their triple-quack talents. Among them is Quiggles, a spirited young duck, adorned with a vibrant trio of quack-themed accessories, who
Alph duck
becomes a symbol of the power of three quacks.
The society's strength lies not just in their unique communication but also in the legendary figure of Quasar, a magnificent mallard with shimmering night-sky feathers. Quasar's triple-quacks can create ripples across the entire pond, inspiring unity and togetherness in the community.
Adding a touch of innovation is Quacktron, the upgraded jetpack cyborg duck. Equipped with a state-of-the-art quack-powered jetpack and enhanced with cyborg technology, Quacktron soars through the skies during special events, merging tradition and technology seamlessly. Quacktron's role extends beyond entertainment; he serves as the society's technological advisor, blending quack wisdom with advanced computational abilities.
In this whimsical world, the Quack Quack Quack Duck Society embraces the magic of triple-quacks, the strength of unity, and the perfect fusion of tradition and technology. Tales from this feathered community resonate through the reeds, reminding ducks young and old of the joy found in the art of triple-quacking and the enchanting adventures within their one-of-a-kind society.
The bald kid story:

The bald kid image
Rare Image of the
"bald kid"
Staring Jamie down, as this picture was taken in appears to be in a apartment, suggesting they both live together.
https://alldimensions.fandom.com/wiki/File:The_bald_kid_meme_video.mov
Footage of Jamie getting hit after angering the
"Bald Kid".
The bald kid was Jamie’s(me) childhood friend and one day we decided to have an arm wrestle and he beat me in 0.00000000000 seconds and I just found out how truly strong the bald kid was, even if there is 6 people the bald kid still managed to beat all of them in 0 seconds.
The bald kid traveled to Malaysia to visit Jamie and there they made a meme called “this is why you shouldn’t make fun of bald people”. The meme was about Jamie making fun of the bald kid for being bald and then he slaps the camera with full force and that is when I realized his true power when he slapped me.
I got a serious bruise and the camera came flying out my hand. When I showed my friends in school the meme, they even started making jokes from how powerful he was such as saying that he was so strong what if he accidentally thinks of having the idea of destroying the universe, it would happen instantly as soon as he thought of it in his brain. I found out that the bald kid was the strongest entity ever in this verse and destroys many universes my accidentally thinking of it in his brain.
Luckily the bald kid is my best friend and he can destroy every single enemy I have so all my problems can easily be erased.
But one day when I was playing tag with the bald kid, I hid in the stairway of my apartment floor so I could run away from the bald kid and I closed the door. Suddenly the bald kids head peaked out from  the yellow when I looked at it for more than five seconds, I got jumpscared so badly and then he stared to walk toward me but he wasn’t trying to tag him and I couldn’t see his face properly  because it was dark inside the stairway so I quickly came out, slammed the door and went back to my apartment house. when he came back he was trying to tag me and was laughing so I didn’t know if was that a different version of the bald kid or even a different person.
(Svki) : Even i wanted to see that video again cus its funny and it shows how powerful the "Bald Kid" really is, you do not want to call 光头 or balls or it may be your last.
(Svki's Reply) : so in a few years back, jamie had a friend who was bald AKA
"Bald Kid",
Jamie showed us how powerful he could be by showing some videos on his watch, basically all the videos were him calling out the bald kid just to be hit and beaten up by
"Him"
, the video always serves the reminder of how powerful the
"Bald Kid"
could be. As shown in the video
The is even a backrooms level about him that was also made by Jamieyangletian12345 (me) you should go check that out as well in the
stairway
.
Anyways I was having problems because my enemy created an army against me and I secretly created a secret alliance to fight back against his army so I requested the bald kid to join and he accepted.
Hugo boss story:
[
]
In the year 2022, rumors began to spread in hushed tones about a boy named
Hugo
. Not just any boy—he was called
Hugo Boss
, a name that echoed strength, fearlessness, and mystery. Some said he once took down five older teens with nothing but a stare. Others claimed he lifted a motorcycle off the ground to save someone pinned underneath. But nobody could confirm it. There were no pictures. No videos. Just stories.
I met him once. Just once. But like a dream slipping through your fingers, I forgot how he looked… and what exactly he did. All I remember is a presence. A presence that made time slow down. The way everyone around him looked at him—you could tell. He wasn’t normal. He was something
else
.
Three years passed. I thought Hugo Boss was just a childhood tale, another exaggeration from the schoolyard. But then, my older cousin said something that shook me.
“There’s someone we could go see. He’s the strongest guy I ever knew. A
legend
. His name’s Hugo Boss.”
It hit me like lightning.
He was real.
This was my second chance to meet the forgotten titan. But fate had other plans. Once again, I failed to meet him. Whether by accident or destiny, Hugo remained a shadow on the edge of my story.  Although Hugo boss was just a nickname we gave him because his English name is Hugo and he is like a final boss so we gave him the name of HUGO BOSS.
Hunter boss special forces
Hunter boss story:
[
]
Hunter boss is actually the twin of hugo boss, but he is not really recognized that much because Hugo boss gets more attention and he is overall stronger. He has experience using a gun because he had a trial at the special forces with my uncle.
Hunter boss is also very strong in combat as well, my family sometimes also ones about how strong hunter boss is like they said, “bro he can literally pick up the whole universe with just a finger and he his gun skill is so OP that he could shoot someone that was from another universe” but he was not as glazed as Hugo boss.
Hunter boss has been known for his insane lifting strength skills along with martial arts. I have first knew about hunter boss was that my older cousin told me that Hugo boss has a twin and he was only a bit weaker than Hugo boss, so I was like “ bro then why didn’t they join the special forces if both of them were that strong”
“They did” my older cousin said
Unfortunately I don’t  have a picture of hunter and Hugo boss because I never met hunter boss yet. Hunter boss got his name because he likes hunting animals and acts like a final boss so we gave him a name that was like his twin, hugo boss.
I sent him an invitation to hunter boss and asked him if he wanted to join The Jamie secret alliance and he accepted the deal.
The fat kid story:
[
]
The fat kid used to be very fat when he was younger  and he would always get bullied s a little boy but the bald kid outed always protect him since they are really close friends. I would ways be for the fat kid whenever he would get bullied by those people.
A few years later, the fat kid decided to go on a diet and would work out everyday. 3 years later the Fat kid finally redeemed himself and he became stronger than he ever was. Rumors say that he would lift hundreds of kilos and my parents even joke about that if the sun fell onto earth, The fat kid would just lift the whole sun.
The fat kid finally got revenge on his bullies and humbled them. The fat kid is a pro biker as well, he can do a flip on the bike because his legs were so strong, I also heard that he would even put up a good fight against the bald kid and Hugo boss. The bald kid was impressed by his hard work and Hugo boss was really surprised.
People still call him the fat kid because he was fat for all those years and were the words that made him into a Brocken villain. I sent an invitation for him to join the Jamie secret alliance and he accepted because he wants to repay the favor of protecting him from bullies.
Jamies older cousin story:
[
]
Jamies older cousin is the menace of the Jamie secret alliance and I added him into the Jamie secret alliance because of his manipulation power.
My older cousin is able to manipulate someone to throw away something that is worth a lot, His manipulation is very dangerous because it is almost 100% that someone will fall for his manipulation and listens to his rules. although he is not much of a combat person but his manipulation is the main power of him, His manipulation is powerful enough to: stop people from hurting him, make someone throw away something that is very valuable and make others listen to him.
He once manipulate my younger cousin to throw away something that is worth 200 MYR he found and here is what he said:
“ I don’t think you understand how dangerous finding stuff in public, It could belong to anyone and why would someone be dumb enough to lose something that is this valuable?, Unless it could be a trap from some evil person that maybe has put something inside it like a bomb or something that could threaten the whole family, so you either throw away it now or get your family endangered”.
That paragraph right there made my younger throw away that object he found and it let him traumatized for the rest of the day, I included him to the Jamie secret alliance so that he could be the mind of this whole team and manipulate others to join us. I think his manipulation is very powerful and could go very useful for the Jamie secret alliance so I let him join.
Jamies secret weapon:
[
]
Jamies secret weapon is called the red button and it is the strongest weapon Jamie has, when it’s pressed, many
The red button
dangerous things in different intervals will happen that are more dangerous than Kim Jong un’s red button and here is why:
Phase 1: 
When the red button is pressed, the first thing that will happen is 500 quadrillion tsar bombs that are the size of earth comes heading towards the enemy and then 500 octillion stars that re the size of Stephenson 2-18 come crashing towards the enemy but if the enemy survives phase 1, that means he would just be ready for phase 2.
Phase 2:
If the enemy somehow survives all that power then Hunter boss and the special forces will arrive with all types of mysterious equipments that are countless of numbers beyond tsar bombs. Their guns have infinite bullets and the bullets are special bullets called “power bullets” which  bullet is able to destroy a single universe. But if the enemy is very strong and survives it then they would have to be ready for the final boss phase with 0% chance of survival.
Phase 3:
If the enemy survives phase 1 and 2, The bald kid and the other built different members will appear and they have too much strength to handle and is almost 100% death because The bald kid has a mysterious amount of power that is too much to hold. That is why the red button is the most dangerous weapon Jamie has.
The Orange Button:
[
]
The Orange button is a button within the J.S.A Island that will activate all the island's defenses and fire them at whatever triggered it and summon all the members of the alliance to the island. It doesn't need to be pressed, as The Sussy Dog's aura will make it press itself if it detects any threats within ♾️km.
SUSSY DOG (bonus)
[
]
Sussy dog is truly the strongest in this entire verse, it’s power level is beyond highest numbers that humans have invented, he can decided for things to not exist and it would just happen because his power is far beyond measurable.
The Sussy dog
Sussy dog originally died in his first life because he got killed by a chef but he got reborned and started his villain
The sussy dog
his villain arc and is the most powerful being in this entire verse.
Sussy dog is not an omnipotent god, he is the absolute infinite to the absolute infinite power times the absolute infinite of an omnipotent god, he can just do anything in his brain and it would just happen, he needs to do nothing and he can destroy absolute everything and he was self created.
His aura is so powerful it can remove the most powerful entities ever and not even the bald kid or Hugo boss could penetrate his aura. It has to take around 50000 the bald kids to penetrate the Sussy dogs aura which is already the weakest layer of power on the sussy dogs aura.
His second layer is an invisible shield and if 50000000000 Hugo bosses punch the shield with full force it would only to 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of the sussy dogs shield can make his shield go back to not being damaged at all when its damaged which is literally impossible.
When sussy dog punches something, omniversal things would happen such as multiverses exploding, starts colliding and decillion omniverses gets deleted and the space itself would get cooked.
It is so powerful that talking about him would make them feel the aura of sussy dog and I better not explain anymore r your device will get destroyed by the sussy dogs aura.
Jamie to the bald kid: “ hey bro you think you can defeat Sussy dog?”
The bald kid to Jamie: “ he’ll naw bro I can’t even penetrate his aura”
My aunts dog
[
]
My aunts dog is a really good friend of sussy dog, my aunts dog my not be as powerful as the sussy dog but My aunts dog still is very powerful.
My aunts dog can teleport from a whole universe to another and destroy it make making some sounds and the sound waves
My aunts dog
are literally enough to Implode multiple metaverses.
but my aunts dog is around the same powerful as the bald kid but Sussy dog can slow obliterate multiverses easily by moving its paw, making my aunts dog the second most powerful dogs there are.
My aunts dog is also a dog that recently started its villain arc due to abuse of its owners, now he is strong as hell and can obliterate countless galaxies and universe by just deciding it would happen.
My aunts dog is beyond quadrillions of entities and it can just win by accidentally moving. MY aunts dog became the villain it deserves to be and became so strong that it can almost beat the bald kid.
David the handcrusher
[
]
David is a 10th grade student in Jamie’s school, he is known for wandering around the whole school and asking people for handshakes, If someone accepts the deal then they would make a huge mistake because he would crush their hand really hard that it feels like bone being crushed.
One time, Jamie also made the mistake of shaking David’s hand and Jamies hand got crushed and cooked. Jamie’s hand literally felt like all his bones in his hand are being squished
Jamie literally heard that David can actually crush the devils hand an could easily crush omnipotent gods hand, he can literally crush the entire metaverse with a single handshake, making him one of the most dangerous person in the Jamie secret alliance.
I thought his hand crushing strength would go great for the Jamie secret alliance. So We sent him an invitation to join the Jamie secret alliance.
Dillan
[
]
Dillan is an average guy in terms of strength but he is very smart( 90000+ iq). So he is Ben's assistant in making tech. He is very frail though and wouldn't even be qualify as a dummy for the bald kid though.
Mr Interesting
[
]
Mr Interesting also known as the "Roasting Master" is the master of roasts. He even managed to defeat and manipulate the bald kid to hesitate to attack him for 5 seconds which is definately a huge feat.
Ma Jungwoo "The Final Boss"
[
]
Ma Jungwoo (MJ for short) is a strong guy. He is mid to the bald kid but on any other standard he is insanely strong. He could easily punch a hole in the
allsphere
and often would.
Mini Jaya
[
]
Mini Jaya is not strong or smart but he is heavy and fat. His main power is jumping. When he jumps, he destroyed an entire allsphere. Never call him a "black donkey" though or else you are guranteed death by squish.
Jaya
[
]
Good at roasting and fat as hell. His primary powers are jumping to destroy the Impercivable Plane and making people question their own reality by roasting them viciously. Never call him a "black donkey" though or else you are guranteed death by squish.
Chitransh
[
]
Chitransh has the most powerful jawline ever and can easily cook anyone is they touch his sigma Ohio rizz aura farm jawline, they will all get cooked. Chitransh is very built different because his jawline could cut through Omni verses and hyper verses easily with only touching something with his powerful jawline.
The AEA (Ally)
[
]
The AEA stands for Anti Edward Alliance, which is made up of guys who hate Edward. The Alliance has about 20 peoplewho are our friends and who hate Edward because of the same reasons as me and the rest of the alliance. So we partnered up with them to kill Edward and they will help us kill the QQDS.

Jamies secret nuke
[
]
Jamie had enough of regular tsar bombs(can already destroy the Metahierachy and the Novachain) and nukes so he got created and started designing a custom nuke with hunter boss, this nuke has the power of 34567890987654323456789034567890987654567890987654323456789845678945678987654323456789x Omni-stars if it were crashing towards earth. The nuke will be so much more powerful that it can damage the bald kid or maybe even damage sussy dogs aura(unconfirmed)
This nuke is so powerful that not even hunter bosses power bullets are stronger, the only one that can stop this nuke
The Jamie secret Nuke
is the bald kid, Hugo boss and the sussy dog.
Jamies nuke can obliterate countless Impercivable Planes very easily and is happened in phase 2 of the Orange button, which Makes Jamies orange button the second most powerful weapon Jamies has.
At the front of the nuke, there is a drill that cannot break and can drill through multiple galaxies without it being damaged at all and it is very useful because it can drill through if the enemy has a shield or something to defend itself.
These are constantly armed all over the island.
The J.S.A island:
[
]
Introduction:
[
]
Jamie needed a secret island so could have his own headquarters there and told The bald kid, Hugo boss and Hunter boss to go with him to find an island so they did and they died tons of secret technology and weapons that not even cosmic gods can destroy because it is full of defense and technology and that is also the location of where the red button is. This island is so powerful that it can stop a whole multiverse if it were headed toward earth, there are only top secret soldiers there and is highly restricted for people to Enter the island and can only be entered by high class J.S.A (Jamie secret alliance) members. This island has Jamies secret headquarters and the location of the nuke. There will be tons of soldiers, Artillery canons and nukes than can implode galaxies, the island has all the secrets of the J.S.A but it is almost impossible for anyone to enter because they will be many traps in the oceans that are a 0% chance of survival.
Finding an island:
[
]
Jamie has prepared to fight against the quack quack duck society so he bought an island by threatening the owner with the red button, Jamie had to ride 10 hours on the fastest boat in the world to get there, that’s how secret the island is.
Jamies arrival:
[
]
When Jamie finally arrive at the secret island and Jamie decided that this island is going to be the main headquarters of the J.S.A, Jamie hired thousands of trained marines and army soldiers to defend the island and the headquarters is going to be underground.
Island Location:
[
]
The island is hidden between the Pacific Ocean and is bigger than Hawaii. This island is very hard to enter because there will be countless traps that Jamie set up in the ocean and there will be ones that cause a gigantic whirlpool, a big water tornado and a huge water explosion.
major zones on the island:
[
]
1. The Jamie headquarters (Location: underground)
2. The Gym for the bald kid (Location: at the end of the island)
3. The Roasting hall (location: East of the island)
4. The secret technology zone (Location: a base at the bottom of the ocean)
5. The vault for the red button (location: also underground)
6. Training arena (location: west of the island)
Goals:
[
]
- to find the quack quack duck society island called quackington
- to find Tom
- defeat the bald kids sister
Layers of defense the island has:
[
]
-Invisible Forcefield
[
]
There will be an invisible Forcefield which is already impossible to go through because this forcefield can survive stars crashing towards it.
- the soldiers
[
]
The soldiers guns are all filled with hunter bosses power bullets and nothing on earth can survive even one single bullet of it.
- the artillery canons
[
]
There will be countless artilleries there and their ammo is stronger than the power bullets and can easily kill
The artillery canon
omniversal beings which can implode planets easily.
- The Land mines
[
]
The island will be filled with landmines that are like explosion's that could destroy the whole galaxy but it wont affect the island because the forcefield will save it but it is already built different enough to survive all the land mines because the island is made out of special rocks that can survive universes colliding.
- the Laser turrets
[
]
These Laser turrets are built different as well because these laser turrets can cut through multiple universes easily even if it was on for 0.0000000001 milliseconds.
- Guard golems
[
]
Guard golems are AI controlled mechs with heavy armor that is impossible to destroy and built in rocket launchers and it can destroy everything in its way.
- Shockwave generators
[
]
Once the enemy steps foot on the island, the island will sense it end immediately send shockwaves to the enemy and it is impossible to escape because it can burn literally anything into pure dust by only releasing it for 1 millisecond.
- Emp towers
[
]
These Emp towers can not only shut off any electric device that the enemy has but any weapons that is not related to electric as well in fact they are so powerful they can instantly blunt swords and jam guns, making it the most powerful Emp towers ever.
- auto tracking drone devices
[
]
These drones can track down any one even if they are in a very good hiding spot, it also has power bullets in it so it can shoot the enemies by itself but if it fails to kill the enemy, it will send alerts to the headquarters that a strong enemy has arrived at the island.
- hidden pressure plates
[
]
If an enemy accidentally steps on a hidden pressure plate then 10 nukes will drop straight towards them and they can’t be stopped, This nuke is made out of special materials that can harm enemies but it can’t harm the J.S.A members and the island.
- Secret sniper compartment
[
]
A trained sniper such as hunter boss will be hiding in a secret compartment where the enemies can’t see, and the sniper gun will be filled with infinite power bullets. And 100% the enemy can’t see the sniper base because it is hidden inside of the island with absolutely no way to see it and Jamie also added an invisible material to cover the compartment, to make sure it is impossible to see.
- Sussy dog's aura
[
]
Sussy dog's aura will kill anything that is not on a special guest list that approaches within a transinfinite distance of the island. This defense is the most powerful defense ever on the island.
The J.S.A boat:
[
]
This boat will be the main boat of the Jamie secret alliance island, this boat is connected to the dock at the island. This boat is very big, it is as big as the titanic and it is reinforced with a material that is impossible to destroy and the boat is gonna be filled with a lot of defense weapons such as air rockets, dual artillery canons and muscle pods. All of the defenses the boat has are all filled with hunter bosses power bullets, The captain of this boat will be Hunter boss and his special forces members will be there as well to destroy any enemy in its way. This boat is immune to all of the traps Jamie set up in the ocean because of its tough armor, this boat will also be the first line o defense whenever an enemy is trying to invade. It can travel 999999999 MPH easily and this boat cannot run out of fuel because it is built different. At the front of the boat there will be a sharp edge that can easily pierce through mountains and can even deflect canons being launched at the boat, if the boat ever gets attacked it will send signals to the Jamie secret alliance island and Jamie will send dozens of strong members to take out the target.
About the deal with the LUA(not the coding language)
[
]
The Jamie secret Alliance made a deal with the
Local Universal Alliance
quite recently. The LUA agreed to supply soldiers and equipment to defeat the quack quack duck society and the Alliance set up a base on Terabithian soil to protect the organization should any threats arise.
The Cloning Center
[
]
The cloning center is a giant center on the island that clones gigachad soldiers, gigachad vehicles and gigachad cyborgs from the LUA so the Jamie secret alliance can produce infinite soldiers. The cloning facility currently produces
3,674
soldiers in 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of a voidsecond.
The Sussy dog statue
[
]
In the middle of the J.S.A island there will be a statue to remember sussy dogs past life and will be remembered by the Jamie secret alliance .
And and..
oh wait damnit, the sussy dog has way too much aura……
oh no his aura is way too powerful, there is only available for one content of the sussy dog, and two will be too much.
ERROR…
ERROR x2…
Retrying…
seeking help from the bald kid*
Tysm the bald kid, you took away sussy dogs aura for now, make sure to return the aura later…
Anyways, this statue is actually a trap made by Jamie and the sussy dog, it can be used to remember sussy dog for the alliance members but it is the most dangerous trap to enemies because the sussy dog has inserted his powerful aura inside the statue.
Whenever enemies approach it, they may think it is just a regular stature but they are wrong, their body will get evaporated and exploded in 0 seconds because of the sussy dogs aura, the aura can already destroy infinite omniverses 
very easily.
The J.S.A leaves the island for now and makes an agreement with the president of
Terabithia
[
]
The J.S.A leaves the island for now and goes to terabithia to make an agreement with the president.
Jamieyangletian12345
finds
mrhappymonyet
and asks him for an agreement and you hesitates for a second but agrees. They know that the J.S.A has very powerful forces that can help destroy the quack quack duck society and the other enemies they have.
They start by preparing their strongest weapons and strongest defense layers, they have a lot of defense layers that is impossible to penetrate and get through, since the QQDS island is going to invade.
When Jamie and the J.S.A goes back to the island for now and meets up with the bald kid,
“ I made an agreement with the president of
Terabithia
“huh”- the bald kid
“so we can take down the QQDS”- Jamie
“ wait uhh *checking his computer*, CRAP, Tom made an alliance as well and teamed up with the QQDS…” the bald kid
to be continued…
WIP
The teleportation device
[
]
The stronger JSA members such as the bald kid or Hugo boss could easily teleport because their powers are way too strong but or members that aren’t as powerful, they need to use a device on the island where it can be used to teleport from one place to another.
The person needs to stand on the device and slowly their body will get sucked inside of that machine and once he reaches his destination, the device from another destination pulls him out and the person will reach his destination.
Jamie has made infinite amount of copies of this device and put it on very random destinations where no one can find, and it uses a Face ID where only J.S.A members can use.
If the Face ID see’s that the Face ID is not matched and is a different person, it will end signals to the Jamie’s secret alliance headquarters and will shoot power bullets at the target.
The respawn point
[
]
On the island, there will be a respawn point where a weak JSA member dies, the machine will recognize him and will make the guy come back to life and respawn at the respawn point machine.
However they need to scan their body first at the respawn point machine, if they didn’t then they wont have a chance to respawn and they will die, so Jamie makes sure every single member has scanned their body at the respawn point machine.
This respawn point is also indestructible and its even more built different than Amir, only the bald kid and the sissy dog would be able to break the device because the bald kid is the creator of this device and sissy dog is so powerful that he can just decide for the device to break.
The E₮fril Tower
[
]
On the island there is a tower called the E₮fril Tower that is made out of
Corruptite
that the weaker members of the JSA can hide in. If anything else touches the tower they die instantly and become part of the tower itself.
