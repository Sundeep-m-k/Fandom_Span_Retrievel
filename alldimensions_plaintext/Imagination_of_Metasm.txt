The Imagination of Metasm is a verse that function as
Metasm's
imagination. The size of this verse is confirmed by
Metasm
to be
ℵ
Λ
Λ
{\displaystyle \sqrt[\Lambda]{\aleph\Lambda}}
, the Vsaueract
[

]
root of a Metavsaue
[

]
. The largest object in
Metasm's
imagination is the
Limit of Fiction
. Even though it would take an insane amount of effort and focus to make an imagination as large as
Metasm's
is for normal
Polyasms
,
Metasm
considers it a casual feat for him

. Despite how large
Metasm's
imagination is, it pales in comparison to the size of his
Subconscious
Mind.
