The Trultimatum
, or
T H E  T R U L T I M A T U M
is the third step in the
Ultimatum's chain
. Its after
the Bultimatum
, and it's clearly a lot bigger than the former.
About temperature, its more randomly than in
the Bultimatum
.
It has some precious colors, which are blue and green (See the image).
Like in the other ones,
"If the thing doesnt contain it, it contains the thing."
But this is not the end in the
Ultimatum's chain
, there are some more levels that will soon be released, so wait until their articles are made (already done)!
"Uhh guys, can you stop discusing?"

"NO, I WILL NEVER ACCEPT I AM NOT THE BIGGEST, AND THE ONLY WAY TO DESTROY THIS ANGER IS TO MAKE JOKES ABOUT BEING BIGGER THAN ULTIMATUM!!!"
-The Bultimatum
"Stop, or i will destroy your face"
