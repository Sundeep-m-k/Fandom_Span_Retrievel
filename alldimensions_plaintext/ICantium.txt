Discovery
[
]
ICantium was discovered after a Level 6
Fractureverse
suddenly glitched and had its Schwarzschild radius become extremely huge, causing it to collapse into a black hole. During the process, an unknown substance was ejected at high speeds into the neighboring cosmos. This substance was subsequently studied and named ICantium, after ICantEdit, the
Transcendent Omni-God
who created the Fractureverses.
States of Matter
[
]
ICantium has 5 states of matter. All of these states have their own special properties.
Solid
[
]
ICantium does not turn into a solid very much. When in solid state, ICantium has shown to be exceptionally heavy and hard to move. Solid ICantium is also radioactive to the touch, and can corrode substances around it. ICantium appears to be a smooth whitish-brownish color when in this state.
Liquid
[
]
Liquid ICantium is the most common type of ICantium. When in this state, ICantium will behave extremely weird, such as somehow duplicating, moving by itself, and even exploding and turning into a random element. Liquid ICantium has a patterned look to it, with the pattern resembling a fractal.
Gas
[
]
Gaseous ICantium is a rarer form of ICantium. In this state, ICantium will be almost completely invisible through all wavelengths, and will not interact with other matter or substances. The only way to turn gaseous ICantium back into liquid/solid ICantium is to use
Blueprint Particles
to change the very fabric of ICantium in order to switch its state of matter.
Plasma
[
]
ICantium in a plasma state is extraordinarily rare, and has only been seen 10 times. When in this state, ICantium can somehow make everything around it extremely cold, even though ICantium plasma is insanely hot, so hot that it breaks temperature completely.
Glitch
[
]
Glitch ICantium only occurs when
Glitchonicite
comes into contact with liquid ICantium and fully mixes. Glitch ICantium is by far the most chaotic state of ICantium, and has all the properties of the previous states along with a few extra ones. If you try to measure the temperature of Glitch ICantium, whatever device you're using to measure it will just read NaN if tried.
