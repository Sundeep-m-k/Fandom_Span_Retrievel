lets start with a simple question: "
how do you define reality?
" is it simply everything we can see? No, that would be extremely ignorant of how much things are out there, there are things we don't know exist, but they do
exist,
everything has a cause but If beings can exist without a cause, then the rules of reality might be failing and not even work. If you think
he's
real
, then he is. If you
don’t
, then he never was. But that won’t change what happened. You will
never
prove
he’s
there. You will never prove he’s not. But now that you have, the door is
unlocked
,
even if you cannot see it
,
______
is very much real.
What does it mean to be real though? If our reality was fabricated, nothing would have mattered, but
something
does matter and by that our
reality
isn't
fabricated
, what is this something? It couldn't be something physical, it would surpass that, it couldn't be something caused, it must be timeless, free of any temporal chains, can we think of this something? No, we can't see it, it's colors transcend light, no shadows can be found, it can't be in any up, down, left, right, place since it's presence would break the every fabric of our dimensions inside reality, what is it, this something? It's not mortal nor god, it's not a force of nature, it is it's own thing, it is beyond sight, it's beyond any comprehension, not just our comprehension but the comprehension of
god-like beings
, what is this something? just when you think you can think of this, you
don't
, it is utterly
horrifying
, yet so
beautiful
, and even then we can't sense this, it does not change, it is already in front of you and behind you and is everywhere, you can't see it, but if you do, then the door will be unlocked, the inside illuminating everything, and that's when you see it, the thing that has everything leading to it, the something, and when it speaks, eternity crumbles, and infinity shakes, with it is one word:
