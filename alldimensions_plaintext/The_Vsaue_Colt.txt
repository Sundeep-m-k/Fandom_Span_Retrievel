Vsaue Mihael is the strongest member of the Vsaue Colt. It has
a deep hatred towards anyone who says that "colt" is spelled "cult"
, in which Vsaue Mihael will start to "bully" the creature and call them every single synonym of "racist", as well as every synonym of "fascist" and related ideologies, a phobia of every sexuality, and more. If the other creature says that Vsaue Mihael is bullying them, Vsaue Mihael will usually respond by saying that it was merely joking around.

To get rid of Vsaue Mihael
Species
Vsauer
VsaucecuasV is the weakest out of the 3 main members, but is still extraordinarily strong. VsaucecuasV secretly loathes Vsaue Mihael, as VsaucecuasV once told Vsaue Mihael that "colt" was spelled "cult", in which Vsaue Mihael started calling VsaucecuasV "racist", "bigot", "transphobic", and all the other names. This greatly angered VsaucecuasV, who tried to get rid of Vsaue Mihael by talking to a higher god. However, the higher god agreed with Vsaue Mihael that it was all a joke, so they did not destroy Vsaue Mihael.
