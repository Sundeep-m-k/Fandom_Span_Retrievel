Juvenile God
Rules over
Nothing as a Juvenile.
Age
Under a specific age, can be older if there are delays between full processing of Godfood and eating.
Size
Same thing for size as knowledge, but Juveniles are 25% the size of the average of it's kind when created, so the equation becomes 25% + (growth x 0.75) instead.
Knowledge
Percentage of knowledge compared to the average adult of it's kind is equivalent to the percentage it's grown.
Power
Mostly defenseless before 75% grown, which only forms a Zul'em matter shell for protection.
Goals
Just wants to grow up.
Juvenile Gods are like the babies of Cosmic Entities, some info about there size, knowledge, etc. is in the infobox.
They require two things to develop. Time, and
Godfood
. Godfood is a special matter made from Zul'em Matter and Angel Matter, which can be used to feed Juveniles. Even if the Godfood is given, they don't instantly start growing. They process the Godfood at a linear pace until it's all processed.
JGs are mostly defenseless until the final quarter of development before becoming a normal god, where they form a Zul'em Matter shell to protect them from other entities. Their only defense before that point is their parent, which defends the Juvenile. To prevent them from not relying on their parents completely, they can't create their own Godfood.
Some entities, like
Replicanti Network Cells
do not require Godfood, and this example is only a JG for a Yalmeon Time. (time it takes for light in the
Lightverse
to travel a small distance) This allows the RNCs to reproduce very fast creating the networks they travel in.
