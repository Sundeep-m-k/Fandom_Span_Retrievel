About
[
]
Frick
is a massive type of
verse
that contains around
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
Universes of Greatness
. Unlike other verses of its size, Fricks contain no rogue
voids
, and everything in them has an atmosphere. Fricks do not have a defined size, and everything in them (except for their cores) constantly change in times of 0, their only limits being that they have to be, in total,
1
ℵ
0
{\displaystyle \frac{1}{\aleph_0}}
or less of their local
Protoverses of Epicness
, and a single part cannot be as small as, or smaller, than 0. Despite being named Frick, they're not contained in the
Frickplexes
and aren't directly contained by any variant of
Fricksvilles
. The many parts of them that are not connected in layers, but by an out of bounds area that is not part of a Frick, nor is it visible to most
entities
.
They act as a transition from Greatness to Epicness.
Local lifeforms
[
]
Frickhumans
[
]
Frickhumans are the dominant species of our Frick. These beings are extremely powerful, and singular ones already have a power level close to even a
Cosmological Recycler
! Frickhumans can easily do many tasks, such as manipulating reality, and are incapable of aging. Frickhumans have a few limits though, hence they are not boundless after all. Frickhumans cannot change their or any object's size, and also are unable of creating life by themselves. The most powerful Frickhumans can see and enter the out of bounds zone. The Frickhumans are also the main reason why our Frick contains no voids, as they use them as storage areas.
Frickers
[
]
Frickers are another sapient species on our Frick. They are mildly powerful, and are immortal in the sense that, if they die, they can easily be recovered. They live in an
Universe
of our local Frick where they are famous to hold competitions. These competitions can be quite unusual like competitions over competitions. Some Frickers possess reality manipulation powers.
Local areas
[
]
Storage
[
]
Storage areas are the most common areas in our Frick. Storage areas are used because they allow an infinite amount of resources in one area. Each storage area contains one type of resource.
Planets
[
]
The
rogue
planets
in our Frick contain Frickhumans and other life. They are comparable to
earth
, just on a much larger scale. Some planets have other features such as floating islands.
Residential zones
[
]
Residential areas in our Frick are a mix of the storage and planet areas. The inside of these zones have huge storage spaces, and their outsides have housing and nature areas. Most Frickhumans live in these areas.
