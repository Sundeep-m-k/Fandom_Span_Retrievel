About
[
]
The
Fiction Breaker Omniverses
(F.B. Omniverses for short) are a
conceptual
type of
verse
, which would be one of the largest within
our
planet
, counting as part of the
first Meta-Class
. These mfs may be some of the biggest things you've seen and you'll ever see!
Explanation
[
]
So that you, the reader, knows how much they expand, how unfathomably COLOSSAL they are, we could say they contain considerable percentages of everything in
fiction
, helping as a breakthrough of it. That's the reason they have "fiction breaker" in their name. The "Omniverse" part is just because of their concept being similar to
them
, as in "containing everything that exists", but on a far larger and meta scale.
These percentages mostly focus on the largest fandoms or internet cultures. For example, there are Fiction Breaker Omniverses that index fanfics from wattpad or from AO3, others that focus on series or movies, etc. Larger and more general groups are instead indexed by
Fiction Breaker Omniverseplexes
, though.
Different
individuals
may classify these types of verses differently, though. For example: some may think a specific Fiction Breaker Omniverse takes up a higher, lower or simply different parts of the percentage of fiction than other individuals. This is another reason they're classified as conceptual verses.
