Fate/Destiny Manipulation and Immunity: self explanatory
String Theory Manipulation: he can control 12 spatial dimensions and 12 Temporal dimensions, This makes him Petaversal+++++(or P5)
Infinite Reach: he can reach anything and pull stuff out of literal nothingness
Omniscience?: why does Beem have this, he's a damn webbing clothes moth, he eats fabric, can't get more simple then that
Reality Alternation: self explantory
immortality canceling: One punch from Beem can send you flying out of the box, doesn't matter if you're immortal, the walls of every box are durable as hell
self-duplication: he can make clones of himself by flapping his wings and also these clones have 85% of his power so like P4.6782910 or something
