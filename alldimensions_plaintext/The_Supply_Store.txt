The prices of these will be measured in Egg-Coins, since BNR wants to revive

.
Estateverse
[
]
You need stuff to get your verses started, especially a verse to start with. That's why TSS sells Estateverses. These verses are also in single-centimeter size for some reason until brought out of the store. A tiny one costs 2 EC, a small one costs 5 EC, a medium one costs 15, a large one costs 35, and a huge one costs 50 EC.
Special Computer
[
]
This computer has a plug and keyboard to go with it. This plug doesn't charge the computer, but instead hooks it up to other machines to do stuff with the verses. It costs 8 EC.
Template Matter
[
]
This matter can be put in the Matter Transformer to be changed into other matter for your verse. A kilogram of TM costs 8 EC. It can also be made through
combining Primordiums
.
Matter Transformer
[
]
The Matter Transformer lets you change Template Matter into other types of matter and has a socket which is supposed to be connected with the computer. This activates the computer and then you can use the computer to search through a library of kinds of matter to turn the TM into. It costs 12 EC.
Macroformer
[
]
This store's version of this machine is yet again connected to the computer, and then you can do programming on the computer, which controls the laws of physics in your Estateverse. It also comes with a tutorial, which can be read in every language in the AD cosmology. It costs 12 EC once again.
Gods
[
]
You can hire a god to rule over your Estateverse while you're gone, and they are very powerful. Hiring a god costs 30 EC, being the second most expensive thing in the store, only cheaper than a large Estateverse.
