The
Infinitium
is a verse can have a size that can be represented using two numbers. The size of this verse is so tremendous all the verses in AD wiki are nothing compared to this. If we take the size of the smaller verses and take
x
size
{\displaystyle x^{\operatorname{size}}}
, it will be 0. However, it doesn't contain everything like
the Verseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverseverse
, and is highly theorized, so it may not exist. There are multiple Infinitiums in reality.
