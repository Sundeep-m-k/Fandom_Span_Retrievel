The Aetherium
Is everything real, or is reality an illusion shaped by perception?
What is a tree without its roots, a nation without its past, existence without a cause? If answers require questions, what of questions without answers?

The flow of time shapes and refines our space of existence.
Yet, even in doubt, we persist. If all collapses into paradox, what remains? Not certainty, but the journey
—the search, the wonder, the endless pursuit. And in that pursuit, we are
real and you are existence Manifested in the being
