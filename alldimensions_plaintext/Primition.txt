known as
Primitions
are one of the last
class -3
objects. They're "particles" that predate the existence of most if not all of the Hypercosmos. Due to their size (or lack thereof), researching them is

.
These "particles" have helped has us learn more about what went on before the Hypercosmos existed. Primitions have a lifespan in the

. Primitions are still the most common "particles". Primitions rarely ever form nowadays, but 10^72 have been observed forming. Currently, every Primiton that has ever existed still exists.
