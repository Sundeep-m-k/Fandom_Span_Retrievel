Do you think you can stop Bongus? Did you really think you could make him the weakest of the cosmic entities and humiliate him? Do you think you could erase Bongus? You will die with these questions answered. The Allsphere shall pay.

Before the

he was. At the end of all things... he waits. he is the void... The breath between life and death... Between death and rebirth. Between heaven and hell. his true form is beyond that which you see. He transcends form -- and shape and substance. This body... These verses... And everyone and everything IN it... Are his creations."
Return now to meaninglessness... Feel the consciousness draining from you. Feel all that you are, stripped away... Consumed. You are beyond loneliness. Beyond pain. Beyond even the memory of what you once were. Bongus is all that -- and more. For unlike you... he has consciousness of what he is.
GOD
. He feels every ripple in the sea of eternal emptiness... Every ebb in the tide of eternal nothingness.
