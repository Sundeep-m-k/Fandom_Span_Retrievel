The
Cosmic Leaf
is a transportation device used to travel between
Absoverses
.
It is extremely small compared to Absoverses
, in order to travel from one to another, it must achieve extremely fast speeds proportional to its size. It achieves this through its shape and tail.
The tail flails very quickly and effectively, it runs on a hidden source of energy that comes from the outside.
Along with this tail, the
Cosmic Leaf
occasionally teleports ahead of itself, this decreases the wait time drastically and increases speed.
A fully charged
Cosmic Leaf
can run at full speed for
1
588
{\displaystyle \frac{1}{588}}
th of an
OYC
year. This may not seem like much, but in that time, a
Cosmic Leaf
can travel across a few
Ketabsoverses
.
