Signal operation
Arithmetic combinators can perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, exponentiation and bit manipulation on the signals they get, and output the answer.

Signal comparison
Decider combinators compare two signals, and they output based on the comparison. This decision can be less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal (≤), greater than or equal (≥), equal (=) or not equal (≠).
