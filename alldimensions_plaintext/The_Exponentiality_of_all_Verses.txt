The Fluidality of all Verses
The Exponentiality of all Verses describes a verse. Relative to the space surrounding it, TEOAV expands exponentially every second, and everything inside follows as well. The empty space inside TEOAV doesn’t, and so escaping
TFLOAV
will basically make it impossible to breach TEOAV, as it expands faster than the rules of… whatever force governs reality at this point, and no other entity can feasibly go fast enough or grow fast enough to escape.
The Exponentiality of all Verses manifests itself as a ‘shell’ that constantly grows. Its growth is so fast it bypasses its own rate of growth, but it is still not, and NEVER will be enough to bypass
TIOAV
. Its size is described as Ω
מin
?̸͖̉͛̍́?̵͕̩̙͇͊̍̑̎͠ͅ?̵̧̡̳̳̮̦̆̊̏̐̉?̴͖̥̣̫̖̙̓
, where ?̸͖̉͛̍́?̵͕̩̙͇͊̍̑̎͠ͅ?̵̧̡̳̳̮̦̆̊̏̐̉?̴͖̥̣̫̖̙̓ is an unmeasurable, indescribable amount. Basically, ?̸͖̉͛̍́?̵͕̩̙͇͊̍̑̎͠ͅ?̵̧̡̳̳̮̦̆̊̏̐̉?̴͖̥̣̫̖̙̓ is infinite and still probably less than Ω
מin
, but it is unquantifiable. TEOAV is
True Nothing
°K, because effectively, and mathematically, TEOAV contains literally nothing (because it’s so big). It therefore has a void percentage of 100%, yet a Finality Index and FOEI that is indescribably large.
So, how
do
you escape TEOAV?
You can’t.
