Jim's cool barn is the highly scientific term for the material form of the collective grouping of all the ideas of what a hierarchy would look like if it was not only a hierarchy but also everything but a hierarchy at the same time, while also being made out of nothing but sandwiches.
Jim's cool barn is taught about in every class ever because everyone must know how to enter Jim's cool barn even though you can't enter it because it isn't a place but a material form of idea matter. This is not the ideas brought to life, but the form of the idea itself in the universe just floating around.
Nobody knows exactly where Jim's cool barn is, or if it even exists, but they are pretty sure by reading this page at least

The concept of Jim's cool barn can never be thought of or read about in any online wiki named after dimensions, or else all of Jim's cool barns would disappear and then reappear and lag out reality because that's a lot of operations per second. If reality lags hard enough, people will start to experience freezing and sometimes game crashes. If reality lags out hard enough, it will shut down. If this emergency shut down does not execute properly,
reality itself will overheat, explode, and recreate itself on a dimensionality level higher than anything in this wiki could possibly reach
. So, please don't lag out the server.
Jim's cool barn also plays a useful role in the physics of microwaving
