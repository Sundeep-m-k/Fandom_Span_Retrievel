The
Metom
is a
class -1
subatomic
Metomic
particle. It is a central component of
containment-recursive
objects (i.e.
the Box
), containers embodying structural hierarchies, and negative-sized particles.
Interactions with space
[
]
Objects compromised of Metoms are more loosely affected by spatial law than
universal matter
. This yields
spatial hyperfluidity
, a state in which an object can contain or be contained by a space in ways contradictory to
universal
spatial law
.
Examples of spatial hyperfluid states:
Objects containing identical or near-identical copies of themselves
Objects containing another bigger object
Objects contained by a smaller object
Objects with negative quantities of content
Limitations
[
]
Objects with an excessively vast size difference do not interact strongly enough to produce spatial hyperfluidity. Objects that are too large in size or distance fail to interact at all.
Metoms are also incapable of yielding sizes out of bounds relative to
the surreal  numbers
. For non-surreal sizes (i.e. the size of
heck
),
hettons
are present.
Formation
[
]
Metoms are formed via the decay of a "confused"
Protoverse
cluster, or a cluster containing infinitely many Protoverses at one coordinate set.
The cluster formation is achievable via transferring clusters of Protoverses into a
black hole
of infinite mass. However, very few universes contain gravity laws and infinite amounts of matter.
