The
Metaversal Trade Hub
(abbreviated as MTH, scientific name: ξ-0E2-P2) is a gigantic planet in the of the metaversal void. It is part of the system ξ-0E2, which only includes it, an artificial metaversal hypergiant (ξ-0E2-S2), and another planet (ξ-0E2-P1). It was first populated in 10,341
OYC
and 422 OD. It is mainly used for trading and commerce in our metaverse.

The System
[
]
The ξ-0E2 is naturally a regular metaversal system.
ξ-0E2-S1
[
]
ξ-0E2-S1 was the first star for this system. It was a metaversal hypergiant 6 AU in diameter, and it was able to fuse elements up until Copernicium. It lasted from -1.1MOYC to 10,440OYC, where it went supernova.
ξ-0E2-S2
[
]
ξ-0E2-S2 is the second star for this system. It is an artificial metaversal hypergiant the same diameter as S1, and it was in construction from 10,440OYC to 10,441OYC. During this time, ξ-0E2-P1 drifted away 1.4AU and MTH drifted 1AU.
ξ-0E2-P1
[
]
ξ-0E2-P1 is a planet that is 43AU away from the star. It is 0.14AU in diameter. Its average temperature was 840ºC before S1's collapse, but its drift made it become 820ºC.
It is sometimes used by species that can handle the high temperatures as a smaller and less population-dense trade hub.
