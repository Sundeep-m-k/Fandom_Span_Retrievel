The
Hyper-Space
, more commonly known as the "mainland" of
The Box
, is an non-euclidean space that composes the majority of The Box. It is filled to the brim with corrupted
Omni-Web
,
Glitchonicite
, and many "chaotic"
Verses
.
Think of it as a larger and more chaotic
Omni-Web
. Not many can access this place, however doing so is essential to escaping
The Box
.
It isn't uncommon to be teleported to a undiscovered verse far away, or to be corrupted and erased here.
This verse also contains an infinite amount of
Barrel Containers
, and many other verses.
Dire Glitchconcite
[
]
Dire
Glitchonicite
is a form of Glitchonicite that is much more corrupted, being able to corrupt entire
Prime Barrels
with just a small dose (10 g)
Due to this, there have been civilizations that have created "Dire Bombs" able to destroy entire
Barrel Containers
easily.
Due to this substance, many travelers here have died and been erased.
