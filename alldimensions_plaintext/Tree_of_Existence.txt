The
Tree of Existence
is a tree to which
every verse in the Omniverse
was conected once. It was the
second object
to ever exist. The
Tree of Existence
once concieved verses from its
braches of life
. The branches would later disconnect from the main verse and retract into nothingness.
These roots ended up proving useless, as the creation of verses was
overwhelmingly
caused by other phenomena, without the need of the Tree of Existence.
As such, all the roots ended up dying, retracting at seemingly infinite speeds. Currently, even
fragments
of said branches and roots are
impossibly
rare. So rare so, it is said that only about
1 in E41###*#58
verses have roots, but even these are at a size too small to be visible with the naked eye. Even with this probability, only
2
fragments of the roots were ever found in our own
omniverse
.
This hasn't stopped
full
branches being discovered, as there exists a verse in
the outside
, with the strongest branch discovered yet.
The
only
known look of matter which composes the branches. This image was created using it, a 24.8 nanometer thin sheet was applied and spread out. The
only
existing copy is that of an old recreation. Even though the recreation was kept in a vacuum locked environment, over the years, it has
completely
lost all color
