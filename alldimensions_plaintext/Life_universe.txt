A
Life universe
is a fictional
Universe
, where everything lives, either in a
fairy-tale way
, or via the laws of said Universe being so complex, that all non-organic matter becomes organic.
The
Life universe
is only a thought experiment, but since its the opposite of the
Death universe
, which has no life, it has a few variants as to what
"everything is living"
means.
The first kind of
Life universe
, is one that can and does,
actually exist
. The laws of such verses are complex, varied and expansive enough, as to allow life formation at
any and all scales
, from most
any materials
. These verses are
unbelievably rare
, but most known are naturally made and not artificial, as they are sometimes too difficult to even construct.
The second type is a fairy tale version of the
Life universe
, a fiction which has existed throughout our
(mankind's)
history, and that is a variant, where everything that can be labeled and is large enough to be seen with the naked eye, is alive. Things like water, rocks, tools, fingers, mountains, clouds, etc.
A third and much more absolute and literal version of the
Life universe
, is one where literally everything is alive. The particles, time, space,
the Universe itself too
.
A fourth but much less popular version, is one where every single subset of a Universe is living. This theoretically would include as many living beings as possible, and can be called an
excessive life universe
.
When a
Life universe
collides with a Death universe, they together create a "normal universe". This definition is purposefully arbitrary as to what it means. This usually means a Universe with some average lifeforms that may grow advanced one day, but that would create an inbalance between the Life and Death universes, with a dowside for the Death universe.
