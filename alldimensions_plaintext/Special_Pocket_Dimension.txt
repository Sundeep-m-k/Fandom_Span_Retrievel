A Special pocket Dimension / Reality is an extremely rare, small reality space with extremely varying size and dimensionality, ranging from around a femtometer to a couple million lightyears at the very extremes.
The difference between a
Normal
and Special pocket dimension is pretty complex, so here is a graph of all the details and differences:
Normal Pocket Dimension
Special Pocket Dimension
- Has a generally 'Normal' set law of physics
- Can be
*relatively* easy
to artificially create
- Very common compared to special pocket dimensions
- Limited dimensionality, 0d to 11d is most common, but any positive finite number is still allowed
- Very stable in structure, almost never collapses
- Free in terms of bound laws of physics
- No known way to create; only found naturally or from a high level god or entity
- Very rare, the only places where it is considered 'common' are usually where gods reside
- Can have up to infinite dimensionality and even negative dimensions
- Highly unstable and chaotic, however still isn't likely to collapse
Special Pocket Dimensions are the type of universes that reside in the
Primordialverse
, so any studying about their properties is usually done around
The Universe Swarm
where they have all split off the
Primordialverse
.
