This page is a listing of a chain of bullshit-cosmological verses that are beyond
The Random Verse.
Everything here is so indescribably vastly larger than everything before it--that anything ever is no longer useful for anything. Pages that come later contain pages earlier in the chain, like most hierarchy pages. It will be separated into arbitrary artificial classifications by the name of Tars. All tars must have at least 5 listed verses.
at this point the jump in size between direct containers at these levels of indescribable nonscriptable sized verses is so large that any hypothetical (truly impossible) terminology that could be used as well as frameworks of the hypothetical truly impossible terminology that could be used to describe or quantify the size becomes entirely useless and pointless for the next verse in the overall containment tree. this means that even if any given verse were to be quantifiable in some way which it already isnt and hasnt since the first class system the verse immediately containing it would be entirely impossible to define, quantify, or describe (script) given the same terms or most generic, all encompassing form of terms used to quantify the previous verse. (this was typed in a rush)
Bullshit cosmology doesn't have an end. The tars do not have an end. They go on for
Genuine Forever.

THE Bullshit Cosmology List / Chain / Hierarchy
[

Here it is.

The "Big"
[
]
It is not Big it is "Big" there is a difference
The "Big" is the domain of
The "God"
, and it is the indirect container of EVERYTHING smaller or equal in size to
The Random Verse.
There is a pretty high probability that people will go to this verse just to try and beat
The "God"
even though they probably won't. They are probably going to destroy this verse sometime soon.
Oids
[
]
Oids are nodes of some sort that form the binding structure of zygiverses. They are mostly unchanging, and every oid is unique with its own contained verses, entities, and objects that are not shared by any other oid. They do not exist for very long, however, and they often suddenly dissipate. This means zygiverses are unstable, as the dissipation of oids can damage or even destroy its binding structure. They are "connected" by links (dios). Oid dissipation completely destroys everything it contains, and often irreparably damages or ruptures the dios that link to it.
Imaginary Zygihedron
[
]
Imaginary Zygihedrons are the binding structures of zygiverses, formed by oids and dio links. They range from being semistable to extremely unstable structures due to oid dissipation being inconsistent. Changing the imaginary zygihedron (IZ) can completely alter its parent zygiverse.
Zygiverses
[
]
These are really large verses that are, to put it simply, just bigger
True Omniverses.
They are host to large civilizations
Caugis
[
]
Caugis are confusing pseudospacial verses that do not function under any consistent or constant set of laws, and are instead sentient, sapient verses that have free will and make arbitrary, seemingly random decisions on how they will act. They are also pseudospacial in the form of higher complex space, which functions differently than
Basic space.
They are similar to oids in what they contain, but are not in any way unchanging. After the smallest container of all instances of caugis and caugisimilar verses, the overall containment tree cones out rapidly, similar to the first half of every
containment
loop
, but on a much larger scale.
Caugibox
[
]
The smallest container of all instances of caugis and caugisimilar verses. After this the overall containment tree will "cone".
Tar 2
[
]
work in progress
The Peppermint
[
]
The Peppermint is a break (and in this case end) in the overall containment tree first cone, and it contains all of the verses in the first cone of the OCT (OCT = overall containment tree). It is mostly comprised of peppermint. Ruled over by etpeimpprn (producer of almost all peppermints, mintpeppers, peppermintpeppers, mintpeppermintpeppermintpepperN-mitpreppers, etc.) Main goal of etpeimpprn is to distribute peppermints and make everything addicted to peppermint. The Peppermint inhabitants are semi active in the
cookie wars
. This verse also has the size of
Genuine Forever
.
Conclusion
[
]
This quasihierarchy is going to go on for the genuine forever.
