The Final Chaoses
The Final Final
is a type of verse made up of geometrical connections of
Final Chaoses
, which are usually lower dimensional. These connections form Final Final, making it a spongelike structure with many varying, complex, organic formations. These also come with convenient, unnessescary parts such as long, thin strips of Final Chaoses where there is mostly just a vast empty space and perfectly sized holes from imperfect tiling just large enough for a spaceship to fit through. The formal definition for a Final Final is a connected collection of Final Chaoses greater than 963.6578111+5609.16666666i, though most Final Finals are much larger than this, due to this number being an upper bound on the amount of The Final Chaoses that can be joined together without having stability.

Metastructures
[
]
There are many metastructures of Final Chaoses in the Final Finals, not all of which have been documented, so you may see more when we discover new ones.
Destruction Cores
[
]
A destruction core.
Destruction Cores are collections of Final Chaoses in a shape that allows them to have have all of their bottom sides sealed off from the rest of their Final Final. After a while, another Final Chaos that doesn't abide by the same rules of logic and geometry as the rest will get inside of the shape, and it's always completely dead. Every single
Final Superposition
in it will be dead, and is not known why exactly this happens, but it probably results from a complex interaction of the glass orbs of Final Chaoses with each other's orbs. After this happens a few more times, the inside of the container is completely saturated with dead Final Superpositons. When oversaturation occurs, every orb that will ever break inside is instantly always breaking and being sent up to a Final Superposition, but they can be going fast enough inside that they escape the Final Superposition that they are places in and rocket off at unfathomably quick speeds, which also happens over 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times per aperiosecond when only counting orbs over the size of a
Final Limbo
. This appears as radiation and massively heightens the risk of emptying and death of all Final Superpositions within about 60,700 Final Chaos' lengths away.
Dissipators
[
]
Model of a dissipator
Dissipators are much like the opposite of Destruction Cores, As their bottom sides are faced outwards in all directions. Aside from making outside travel exceedingly difficult for anything residing within, Dissipators' glass orbs can move very far away from their starting position and sometimes end up in a state of being both broken and unbroken by entering the inside of the dissipator and breaking, but moving into a ΞξΞ into a time before their break happens. The majority of orbs in dissipators are like this, and are sporadically pulled inward and accellerate much faster than normal glass orbs. These orbs create temporary convection currents with the center being the dissipator, and these create the majority of moving Final Chaoses in the Final Final, and can be harnessed for
unlimited power
.
Nuvi-erses
[
]
Uuvi-nerses have the special property of
blanking any data inscribed about them
Ancient Objects
[
]
Our local Final Final is ancient, so it has many historical artifacts and giraffes.
Cold Zones
[
]
Cold zones are sharply divided zones of it that, long ago, recieved an immense concentration of energy, exciting them and making them spread out their immense power to elsewhere, but due to an easy to glanced over aspect of freezing from high temperatures, it became beyond impossibly cold. This glanced over aspect was thermal inertia, which works with five wooden planks. the first plank is absolute zero, and can sometimes be surpassed without use of inertia. The second is maxima freiza, which comes when the temperature reaches the negative version of the highest temperature, and the rest would take too long to explain. Basically, due to thermal inertia, the zone kept cooling down below the fifth filter and plummeted into the abyss in terms of temperature. Cold zones can have their coldness extracted for practical use, although this barely has an effect on their temperature.
The energy that forms Cold Zones is thought to coagulate when the Final Final is being formed.
Those Blue and Black Knot Things
[
]
Other than cold zones, there are also large knots that just float around in the voids between Final Chaoses. They are ties in loopholes in the fabric of their Final Final, things whose existence would put the local
Subfinal Verse
in danger or harm it. These ties were knotted by the very first ascended stringtanglers from
Caneverns
, and the older ones use blue string while the newer ones use black string. These knots can be spotted every 100,000 Final Chaos' lengths on average and are impossible to untie without using whatever they tied away in the first place.
