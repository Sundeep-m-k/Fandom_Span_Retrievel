The deepest apex memory of the highest super brains is inside this box. Nothing can be outside of it, in fact mentioning a fact, you place it in The Box, so it should mean that Uber Box is inside The Box, but by doing that, The Box will contain more information than what Uber Box contains which doesn't make any sense. So Uber Box is bigger and it contains every box.
