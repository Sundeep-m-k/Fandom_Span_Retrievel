Hierarchy
Predecessor of

Successor of

WIP
Metacosmology
is the 2nd level of
hypercosmology
. In fact, hyper cosmology ended with
meta hierarchy
.
And
the extended meta hierarchy
is the beginning of metacosmology.
what is the difference?Â  the fact that now the size or other factors as dimensions do not make sense. They basically break
the cosmic truth
. It's hard to explain. The fact is that metacosmology repeats hypercosmology with minor changes. In fact, looping but with big changes.
important differences:
all the characteristics of the template do not make sense except contained, contained in.
All objects are super conceptual and indescribable. Super conceptual are so conceptual that it is impossible to describe their great conceptuality. We are non conceptual objects for they because super concept..... Error (it is impossible to describe)
prefix -verse? this prefix cannot be used because it is hyper cosmology
low transumreality
- bridge beetween hypercosmology and metacosmology.
the cosmic truth
= no end axiom+ end of hypercosmology.
beyond of the hypercosmos
- start of metacosmology.
