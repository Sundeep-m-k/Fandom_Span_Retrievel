Another object verse. It seems like these are getting weird. Now, what unique feature does this one have?
Well, this one is a very very rare kind of verse. Since it is a cracker, it is a verse where everything is edible. The
Appleverse
isn't actually edible, but this verse is. How is it edible?
Before we get to that, let's just appreciate the look of it. It doesn't really look like a cracker, but it also kind of does. It is abstract art.
Okay. It is edible because it is made of different types of cracker planets and stars, kind of like
Cranberryverse
. However, this one doesn't have any inhabitants, so no one lives here and no one gets the crackers dirty. Not affecting the crackers for a certain amount of time makes them stay edible.
Does this verse have any other purpose? No. But not having a purpose might be the best thing about these object verses so far since you don't see that very often. Even though it doesn't have a purpose, it still is a very great verse and is edible so everyone is happy.
