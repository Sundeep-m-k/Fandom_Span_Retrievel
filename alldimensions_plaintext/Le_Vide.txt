. Many people think this is the last and biggest thing. It is apparently pseudospatial in the form of complex space, and spacial travel through it is possible to some extent. It is the last verse in the linear containment branch / chain after
Ütorÿnùù-ÿtkop
and its contained containment tree / chain. After this the containment tree diverges. This is the end of containment loop 1.
