The Finitumer is what people use to represent something that is completely outside reality, fiction, logic, and even understanding itself. It’s not a dimension. It’s not a universe. It’s not a god or an idea. It’s what exists when nothing else can. You can imagine powerful beings, infinite worlds, authors who write stories, even truths that exist beyond fiction. But no matter how far you go, those things are still part of some system, a structure, a logic, a thought. Even Then, The Finitumer is beyond all of that. It doesn’t follow any rules. It can’t be explained, touched, seen, or even properly imagined. It doesn’t exist in a way we can describe, and it doesn’t not exist either. It’s not mysterious. It’s just unreachable by anything, thought, power, creation, or meaning. It's the Embodiment of complete unreachablity, The Finitumer is what happens when you take a piece from the imperceivable plane and take it though Nihilum, Aperiofinity, And Then The Allsphere, That Result is what we call The Finitumer
