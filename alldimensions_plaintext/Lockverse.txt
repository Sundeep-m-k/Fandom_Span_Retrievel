A Lockverse is a type of verse
which has a barrier so strong it cannot be broken, ripped, punctured, or damaged
. Due to this property, they are invincible to any form of weaponary, even including things such as
Cosmic Cannons
and
Magnitude 5 Sproyongs
.
Lockverses are rarely found, as
they do not seem to be different than a normal verse
. Due to this, no one has attempted to do mass-scale searches of Lockverses.
So far, no creatures/civilizations have been discovered inside Lockverse, as
a Lockverse's insanely-hard-to-penetrate barrier prevents any outside creatures from  getting in
. This has given civilizations inside a Lockverse a massive advantage (or disadvantage, depending on how you look at it) as creatures cannot get in and attack them. However, the civilizations in a Lockverse cannot trade or interact with civilizations outside their local Lockverse.
It is possible to teleport out of a Lockverse using wormhole technology, although this is not tried often due to it being very hard to do so.
The way a Lockverse is formed is unknown
, with many creatures trying to create one and failing. One time, a group of powerful creatures tried to see if penetrating the Lockverse was possible, and made over 10,000
Eelbots
fire nonstop at the Lockverse. This continued for over a few months before all the Eelbots ran out of energy, in which the experiment was cancelled.
Lockverses are sometimes used as hiding places to hide from entities like
Boos Norpekryf
and
The Destroyer
.
