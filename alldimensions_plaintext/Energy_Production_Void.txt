The energy production void is a verse that contains 25 septillion
Black Energy Particles
and 25 septillion
White Energy Particles
, Those 2 particles bounce off and make a terawatt of energy when they collide, and there is also a 50 septillion of the little particles so tons of collisions will happen, if all of them collide of opposite particles at the same time, they will produce 25 billion yottawatts of energy. Each particle is a centimeter big, so the entire void can hold 100 septillion of the little things.
