Class ΔR Stars
(Also known as Ronnagiants, Xennagiants or Brontogiants) are the second largest metric prefix stars, much brighter than
Yottagiants
, but dwarf in size to
Quettagiants
. They are extremely massive, with sizes ranging from thousands to 1 million light years and weighing up to 10^1,000 times heavier than our sun. They have a red hue that get's darker and more noticeable the brighter the star. They are also incredibly bright, shining with the brightness of up to 10^1,500 suns and with temperatures up to 10^900 Kelvin. They are commonly found in
Ochaverses
, the largest of them being found in
Mingaverses
.
The most common type of ΔR Stars are Substars, which are nowhere near the size of regular ΔR Stars. A common example is the
Geraldson 9-21
system, containing two Ronnagiant Substars and one Quettagiant Substar. Substars have a much lower size, temperature, mass and brightness, yet still maintain their color due to the elements they fuse.
Class ΔR Stars fuse many hyperradioactive elements, the heaviest being Rixium, with an element number of 1,002,398.
Lifespan
[
]
ΔR stars, despite their size, have insanely dense cores. This gives them lots of fuel to burn, allowing them to live for around a quadrillion years on average, far outliving even the smallest red dwarves.
Habitability
[
]
ΔR stars have a habitable zone ranging from 10^300 to 10^1200 light years. For Substars, the habitable zone is around 300,000 light years on average.
Rarity
[
]
Around 1 in 10^750 stars are ΔR stars, and 1 in 10^2200 are ΔR2 stars, the largest type of Ronnagiants. For Substars, the rarity is around 1 in 1.3 quadrillion.
The closest Ronnagiant Substar is Geraldson 9-21 A and B, at 15 trillion light years away. The closest main sequence ΔR Star is RMS-3209, at 10^695 light years away. The closest ΔR2 Star is MS-91201, at 10^1,980 light years away.
