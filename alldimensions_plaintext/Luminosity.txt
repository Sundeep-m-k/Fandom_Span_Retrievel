Luminosity
]
features eight shard-like wings that floating behind the player, enveloped in a light aura as they converge and diverge continuously, a ring consisting of several beams binding them. 
The aforementioned structures vary in size, with the four larger ones being positioned in the shape of an "X", and the smaller four forming a "+". In the center of these pieces lies a hollow ring that houses an object covered in a radiant aura. Below the shard wings, a sigil-like object that looks almost identical to the big one but slightly transparent can be seen behind the Luminosity's torso, attempting to spin like a jammed cogwheel, and acting as a halo. Luminosity hovers in the air with their arms crossed even if where Luminosity is have floor. Right arm wield a long broken crystal sword with silver wing-shaped swordguard in their right hand backhanded. Beneath Luminosity, a blue-tinted white aura manifests.
