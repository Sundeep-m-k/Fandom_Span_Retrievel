The Spiral of Conforming Fluidity
is a beauty, known for its elegant vortices and significant double core. The spiral's cores seem to be interacting with each other, making it as unstable as
a rat hunting insects
.
Described as awe-inspiring to a
universe
's inhabitants, its light could be seen from all around the universe. Another spiral like this can be found about 34.7 novendecillion light years away.
Core
[

The cores are spheres of attraction that unlike black holes, do not sucks light. It appears black due to it being probably made of an even darker color than vantablack. The true color was revealed in 1988, in a scientific expedition known as "The Shape of the Spiral's Core", original text from Latin "Forma Spiralis Corum".
Incredible events

In April 11, 2025, the spiral started forming a conforming fluid. It ended on April 17, 2025.
In October 2, 2001, a spaceship flew too close to the core and turned into conforming fluid.
In April 8, 1988, a core in the spiral was discovered, with its own fluidity properties, and the mini-spiral was forming new vortices. A week later, satellite images discovered that the core had dissipated.
In March 14, 1931, a civilization named the Pinians discovered a vortex with 1180 light years per hour galactic speeds.
The core viewed in 1989 from an incredibly powerful telescope.
