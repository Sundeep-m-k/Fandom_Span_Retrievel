The projoverse is a verse that is shaped like a
real projective plane
. It can be one of 4 different shades, being either
blue
,
red
,
yellow
, or
grayscale
, although grayscale is the most common and is usually semireflective, allowing some of the other colors to be seen as if it is the actual color of the projoverse.
They form Gradientverses, and form a grid structure where projoverses all rotate and move almost exacly the same, and the are all exactly
ω

light-

s away from each other. This structure eventually will end, creating large 'clouds of projoverses' that form
Gradientverses
.
