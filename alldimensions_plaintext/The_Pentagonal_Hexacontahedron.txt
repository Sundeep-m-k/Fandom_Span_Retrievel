The Pentagonal Hexacontahedrons
, much like the very far back
Terminal Truncated Nonacontanonagon
, is a shape-based verse with a large amount of planets, stars, and other versal oddities. They are of course scaled up a considerable amount here, considering this thing's size in proportion to
absolute truths
. Speaking of that verse, absolute truths are used as bytes of data in this verse's society's computers, which they rely heavily on. Multiple planets here have been covered in computers if they were not warm enough for life, and the verses created from them harbor many wonders which they are unable to analyze.
Back to the actual verse, the only thing that separates it from a normal verse (without the scale, of course) is having
white holes
as opposed to
black holes
. They spew out paradoxically generated matter and so on, so forth.
It is composed of
pentagonal hexaconeahedrons
; it has stored truth bytes, aka
turthons
(the smallest unit of truth). Its property is truth, as well as beauty. Let's talk about the beauty, (
beautons
). At the barrier of the verse, many plays, artworks, music, etc. are stored. Within the verse is the regular kind. At the barrier, there is just enough beauty that you will just barely be able to comprehend it. Outside is so much beauty that you would not be able to comprehend all of it.
