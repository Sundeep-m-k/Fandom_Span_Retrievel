:scal:
is an extremely powerful
cosmic entity
far stronger than even the likes of beings such as
Bean Man
.
She is extremely hard to damage, requiring at least 61
Vsaues
of power yeeted at her for it to even damage her at all. Even after 61 Vsaues of power has been yeeted the power of that attack is reduced by 60 Vsaues AND THEN reduced by 75%. :scal: can easily create blasts that deal 0.001150 Vsaues of destruction. Due to her high resistance and destructive power she can destroy most
gods
, even those more powerful than her. The only current enemy of :scal: that poses a threat to her is the
Yhaeter of Worlds
, although they are currently neutral to :scal: while hunting
:DoG:
down.
Notable times :scal: had a large impact on.

The Great Fricc'in' War
[
]
The Great Friccin' War was a war between several large groups of
Motherfricc'ers
, which started when three arrogant Motherfricc'ers decided that it would be a funny joke to cause a massive global conflict about their personal struggles. Nobody knows how they managed to pull off such a war. The war devastated their
planet
for around 20
OYC
until :scal:, the unknown observer, got extremely annoyed with them and fucked up their planet. Greater
civilizations
use this story to say why not to cause massive conflicts, lest they anger the higher gods.
