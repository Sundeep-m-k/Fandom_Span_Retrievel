It is a civilization that any other civilization in the Community Central wish they had. Though, the other civilizations are comparatively so small that they can't even be able to see a planck length, because in this case, it would be so big that to humans, it is like the size of an
alienverse
. That's how big it is.
The FANDOM civilization is a perfect, futuristic and technologically advanced civilization. It has over 400,000 wikis (English translation: cities) and 55 million articles (English translation: buildings) and all land mass in this civilization is secured by a thick layer of bedrock, in which people can even live and drive in.
Though even this civilization is not perfect either, as there are some people who don't really respect this certain civilization, who are also called "spammers" or "vandals". However, they can be put in the
Global FANDOM Jail
. Those who are there permanently will be departed into a void that returns them to the planet they were in.
Now, I'm going to tell you that you're reading this very article in this very wiki. This means that you're currently inside a building inside this city of a beautiful planet.
