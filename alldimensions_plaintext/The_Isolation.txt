Most of it is unknown, though what is known is that the
Seeker
resides here, along with some Primordial Particles.
The
Isolation
is the home of the
Seeker
, a faraway
entity
that resides outside of everything and all laws of its
Boxial
. Very little is known about this
verse
, since it is
inaccessible
, no matter how much you clip through reality or hop through different
Existence Ranks
, hence its name.
Structure
[
]
The Isolation, since it is inaccessible, is extremely hard to get information from. However, a
Core of Everything
does have information on the inside of the Isolation.
A Core of Everything containing info about Finality-Î¸
objects describes the interior like this:
"The Isolation has a mostly empty inside, with occasional
Primordial
Particles
such as
Primordium Delta
and
Primordium Sigma
floating around. The only thing located at its center is a small obelisk, with purpose still unknown. At the infinite and inaccessible borders of the Isolation lies massive jagged pillars with huge stashes of
Primordium Omega
inside, presumably a dump for all matter the Seeker has destroyed."
Relationship to Existence States
[
]
The Isolation, since it cannot be accessed using
Existence Rank
hopping, means that it has absolutely no Existence Rank at all, which can still fit in here since logic and every law does not apply here.
However, there is a possibility that the Isolation is in an "imaginary Existence Rank", something that is so complex and elusive that not even
Omni-Gods
can possibly comprehend it.
