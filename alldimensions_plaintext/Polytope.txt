A
Polytope
is an n-dimensional generalization of the 3-dimensional
polyhedron
. In essence, it is any geometric
object
with flat sides. Since polytopes can exist in any dimension, they can be labeled as n-polytopes, with n being the dimension they're found within.
In
certain fields of mathematics
, the terms "
polytope
" and "
polyhedron
" are used in a different sense:
polyhedron
refers to a generic object in any dimension, whilst a
polytope
means a bounded polyhedron.
