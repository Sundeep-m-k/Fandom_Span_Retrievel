The
BAOBG Company Tower
is a Company Tower/Headquarters one of many on the
Betasm-Alphasm-Oni Megacity-Planet
of the
Betasm-Alphasm-Oni- Bat-GOD Company
or BAOBG Company.   This tower communicates and works with other locations all over the Megacity Planet/verse. The location is large enough for the division/section of the world it operates in even, so they are many of it. They try to interact with Cosmic entities like
The Bat-GOD
and
Oni
all the time however it doesn't really work though
The Bat-GOD
does sometimes communicate and appear at this location and they've also tried to interact with the
Pointlessly Omnipotent Worm
It has 500 floors and elevators the 500th floor is the most mysterious floor of the tower.  Several cosmic beings are ignorant of what's on the 500th floor of the tower though it seems to be some a prison or summoning area for another cosmic being.
