Jartos
is a extremely powerful being who created the
Absurdly Metaomnipotent ,Omniscient ,, Pizza?
. His origins are pretty bizzare. An
@everyone
ping once happened which caused over  5,134,010,043,921 iterations of
Alphasm
to get destroyed along with a part of
BEAN MAN BUT AWESOME
. All of their energies was released and some of BMBA's energy also was combined with the released energies of the iterations of the dead alphasms and formed the absurdly powerful being of Jartos. He created the absurdly metaomnipotent, Omniscient Pizza who then recreated the destroyed layers of  Alphasm.
