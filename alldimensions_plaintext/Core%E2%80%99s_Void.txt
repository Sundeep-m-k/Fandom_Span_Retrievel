Facts
Creation
[
]
Core’s Void was created by Core trillions of years ago, his aim was never to kill, he only wanted to make a place where people are allowed to show/practice their magic, once Core’s Void became a large place, Core decided to make an empire out of it, he hired many staff members and he was successful, The Co-Leader, Curstana wanted to expand Core’s Void and make an army, she wanted to teach those magic users how to attack, Core didn’t want this and fired Curstana. one day, Curstana poisoned Core, once he died Curstana took over and made new rules, she planned on creating an army and using it to destroy the other empires that didn’t allow magic, many people didn’t want to do this but Curstana killed them. Later Curstana casted a spell on Core’s Void, which made it nearly impossible to leave unless Curstana allowed you to.
Civilization
[
]
The Civilization is very advanced, they have access to wormholes and are able to manage to control black holes. There are trillions of Magic users in Core’s Void, although everyone wants to leave, they are used to their life. They eat very unusual stuff, like void rocks, Dark Matter Pizza, Wormhole Noodles, and other strange things. The Currency they use is “Lamina”, they are purplelish Gray color, and they come in 1$, 7$, 20$, 30$, 60$, and 101$. The Economy is very successful and easy to get 1,000,000 lamina in 1 year if you trade 1 void rock for 50 lamina, then buy 1 Void Rock and 1 Pink Void rock for 50 lamina, then sell those for 75 lamina and then repeat. The people here are pretty aggressive, lots of fights happen each day.
Military
[
]
Their military is terrifying, they use machines that look like those machines from War of Worlds, instead of shooting lasers, they shoot blackhole rays. Each soldier is already capable of destroying our Modern Earth, they use Invisible Shields to protect themselves and use Supernova Potions to make themselves invincible for 30 seconds, they use blackhole rays or sometimes X7a1‘s, or Carry-able Plasma Rail-guns, and they cause lotsa damage. But we’re only talking about the soldier, we haven’t even talked about the machines they use, one of the average machines that they use are The Tonnerus-618, aka The Void Tank, these Void Tanks are the same size of New York City, they shoot out Antimatter Bombs and leave off hundreds of minefields.
Another Type of Tank is The X-shield 17, or what people call “The Invincible Tank” , these tanks are immune to all types of physical damage, and they are used to destroy, they have 2 nuke launchers, and 10 heavy guns that shoot out Fire Shards, the only way to destroy these things it to use magic powers.
The Deadliest Weapons in Core’s Void military is - The Void Walker and The Fleet 0016. The Void Walker - by far the largest spaceship out everyone, these things are 1.5 light years long and are used to carry billions of soldiers to ambush large empires and only 1,831 of these exist in Core’s Void. The Void Walkers are made out of near-indestructible materials, and are powered by a Nuetron Star, and It takes THOUSANDS OF YEARS to even make a single one, and when a spaceship is about to come the Void Walker sends a black hole to destroy it. It I is easier to destroy a Group of galaxies than it takes to destroy 1 of these.
The Fleet 0016, aka - Final Hope. Used when Curstana is about to be killed and when the Corrupted Army is destroyed, this spacecraft uses the most advanced technology, far more than blackhole technology, Reality Warping, The fleet 0016 is the size of a planet made with metal fused with God essence in it. This thing never shuts down as it uses all the energy around it, for the reality warping part it has two lasers that shoot out well lasers, but each laser is above Planck length temperature which can distort everything around you, this thing also abuses black holes by shooting thousands of blackhole and gamma rays at you. It’s technically impossible to destroy this thing unless you put it in a time-loop. This machine was stolen by Cursed Eclipser before Core’s Void collapsed.

Types of Planets
[
]
Planet Copies
[
]
Since how enpty Core's Void is, magic users have been copying planets from other verses, like Terrestial Planets and Mars. There are like 100 copies of Earth in this Void, and 90% of all planets in Core's Void were copied and pasted.
Types of Stars
[
]
Cursed
Stars
[
]
These types of stars act extremely strangely, they normally teleport to another place every 1,000 years, and when these type of stars collapse, instead of turning into a Nuetron Star, they turn into a Molten Planet, the temperature of these stars range from 70 C to 1,000,000,000 C.
Satanic Stars
[
]
These Types of stars are very deadly, stars of this type that teleport near any civilization can wipe life wherever the radiation hits, like scp 001, these stars torture you while slowly turning you into ugly-freakish Fire blob zombies, these stars used to be common in the early stages of Core’s Void, but curstana hired The All Time to get rid of them, now these type of stars rarely appear.
Solar Systems
[
]
Collided Solar Systems
[
]
Pretty much just two solar systems that collided with each other.
Cataclysmic Solar Systens
In a nutshell, just imagine a solar system with 100+ planets and 7+ Asteroid belts.
The Downfall of Core’s Void
[
]
two men killed every void guard and killed curstana. The end.
