A lot of cables of eternity (Read more to know what those are).
The
computers of eternity
are, as their name suggest, giant computer-like structures where all verses contained by them are made and stored. This doesn't mean they're the biggest verse ever though, just impossibly big. They have impossibly infinite amounts of memory that can be used to make more verses.
"We all live in a simulation"
No one knows who makes these computers work. But, thanks to them, we exist.
If you ever wondered how creation and peace looks like in a material form, the computers of eternity are the answer.

Computers of eternity
Contains
Tons of verses, of which the
Painful worlds
are the largest.
Cables of eternity
are what make the computers of eternity work. They are enormous cables that contain verses too, but have much higher temperatures than the ones of their local computers, so these places are a bit less recommended to be in. They still contain life though, due to some entities adaptating to their conditions. Like the computers, these cables also have amazing colors that change over the time, making them look beautiful.
