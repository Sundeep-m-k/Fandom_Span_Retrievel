Properties
[
]
Although visible, The Spherisquare is translucent except for two cross-sections (shown in The Spherisquare's image). It is completely solid and is almost like glass until the translucent part. The glass portions are hard to photograph, so most images of it will be composed of the two cross-sections.
Visible Sections
[
]
The Spherisquare's opaque cross-sections are made of Duocyclinders, and very rarely they have holes of void (averaging to around 0.1% void on visible sections).
