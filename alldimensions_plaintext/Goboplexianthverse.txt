Decieving looks
[
]
The
Goboplexianthverse
may seem like what is seen in the image, but it's not. It actually is a giant fractal because what looks like a "plane" is actually the barrier of another sphere and the spheres that are inside of it have self recursion.
Rainbow colors and patters
[
]
Rainbows
[
]
Rainbows are caused by intense size, the thing is when things get so big, there color starts to shift due to the same reason some galaxies are red. when that is expanded out into infinite sizes, the eyes don't know what do so they start perceiving different colors from the spectrum than the real color of the object.
Patterns
[
]
Main pattern
[
]
The main pattern, is due to the
Δ particle
. It is unknown why but when in groups of infinite they start to turn into this "goo" like substance and change there look into this "dinosaur" pattern.
bar pattern
[
]
The bar pattern is what actually contains the goboplexianverses; it is unknown why the eyes do not perceive this as rainbow but it is rumored to be forces from the goboplexianverses that change it to its real look, though that is not scientifically proven.
Containing rules
[
]
The containing rules are unknown but you can estimate it by looking at the size.
Reason for fractalization
[
]
The reason for fractalization is due to when The true finalgodplexianthly created this verse, there was a mistake in the building that is unknown today that is the reason why this fractalization. it is estimated that it is because he forgot to carry the 2.
