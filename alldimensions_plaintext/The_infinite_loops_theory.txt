Very short introduction
[
]
The
Infinite Loops Theory
is a very important theory that explains why things like
We reached the Earth... again...
or bigger "looped" things exist. Here's the theory, enjoy:
The theory itself
[
]
We start in our
Earth
. Everything is fine. Then we get to the
Universe
. Everything is still fine. We reach the
Wikiverse
and a bit next we get to
Googleverse
s,
Windowsverse
s, etc. Everything is still fine, until the
Computerverse
s appear. This is where the problem appears. Why do them exists?
This can be explained as this is an enormous loop, where the same things are repeated again, again, again, again... but a lot bigger than before. This means that there are "looped" versions of verses, boxes, etc., Until we get the 2nd looped Earth. Then the 3rd looped. And so on unknown times.
Not even
TOGS
can create these "looped" things, because they transcend all known things. We can only discover them, but its impossible to CREATE them. A theorized concept of a thing that ends all these loops is known as "
Looptima-543
". But its only a concept, and maybe this will be a never-ending loop where things become bigger and bigger and bigger with no end.
We can't even know if in every loop all the verses are the same as the previous loop, but bigger. Maybe some looped verses could disappear - could appear.
Loop Index
[
]
A Loop index is how much "Loopness" a loop has. A Loop with a Loop Index of 0 means that it is a regular loop. No more, no less. And a loop with a loop index of 1 is basically a Loop Loop.
A very short explanation of some loops

0th loop
[
]
The 0th loop cant be called a loop fully, because the "normal verses", which are fictional, are here.
They start with the smallest thing that exists and ends at the
Windowsverse
and other
Operationverse
s.
1st loop
[
]
In the 1st loop the things start repeating, but on a much bigger scale, like we explained before. These structures are the ones we consider real, for example the device you're using to read this right now
It starts with the
Computerverse
s and its end is unknown.
2nd loop and higher
[
]
These loops works like the 1st loop, only that they start getting bigger and bigger and bigger. These also compose beings that are straight up above us and view us as their fiction.
Loop Loops
[
]
These are a different kind of loops that are used when inaccesible amounts of loops are reached. It is like a loop of the loops. And it only gets bigger from here.
Loop Loop Loops
[
]
These are basically Loop Loops on a higher scale. Inaccesible amounts of loop loops are needed to reach them.
Loop Levels
[
]
Since there are so many different types of loops, here are most of them before a Superloop.

Loop Loop Loop Stack

Loop Stack Stack Stack
Loop Superstack
Loop Hyperstack
Loop Ultrastack
Loop Absolutestack
More loop variations than these do exist, but their amount is inaccesible.
And after an endless amount of loops variations, we arrive at this loop that transcends beyond all other loops in its entirety.
Superloops
[
]
Superloops are BEYOND what we simply call a "loop" they are also BEYOND even the concept of "inaccesible" itself. And cannot even be described in the AD Cosmology and even The AD Supercosmology. In fact, it is so ungodily colossal and gargantuan, Not Even Looptima-543 can reach this thing, heck, not even the most powerful Loop-breaking concept can possibly even get near it. In fact, this thing is so huge that It completely breaks the Infinite Loops Theory all together,
In fact, I don't think I can even talk about this on this page, In fact, I don't think i'm allowed to talk about it in the wiki, or, anywhere, really.
The ONLY possible way to even reach this thing is Somehow find a document that talks about it or you somehow manage to find a machine created by a species or civilization that somehow colonized the Superloop.
However, The information above is not ALL the information found about the Superloops. So here is three extra pages for more information.
