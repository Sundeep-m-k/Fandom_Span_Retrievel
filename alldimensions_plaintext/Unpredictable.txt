Meet
Unpredictable
, a tiny fragment of
Impossible
, and a traitor.
Story
[
]
At first, he had no name, but when a war broke out trying to save the
humans
, Unpredictable decided to change sides which made Impossible furious, making the latter banish him from his dimension, never to return. This is why he received his current name: because of his unpredictability.
As a punishment Unpredictable, transformed into a dark smokey shroud, AKA the embodiment of pure evil. He now resides outside our
Omniverse
in his own dimension, which is infinitely large and with a total abscence of light.
