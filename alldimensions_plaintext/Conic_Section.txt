1. Parabola, 2. Circle and Ellipse, 3. Hyperbola
A coinc section is the 1D curve obtained from intersecting a 2D plane with a 3D cone. The four types are: circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola.

Circle
[
]
A
circle
is a rotatope with no flat dimensions and two round dimensions. It is, therefore, the
2D
hypersphere
. It can also be considered as the set of all
points
that are the same distance from a
point
(the center of a circle) in the
plane
.
Ellipse
[

An ellipse is in the form of this formula:
x

=
1
{\displaystyle \frac{{x}^{2}}{{a}^{2}} + \frac{{y}^{2}}{{b}^{2}} = 1}
Parabola
[
]
A
parabola
is a conic section with an eccentricity equal to one. All quadratic curves are also parabolas.
Hyperbola
[
]
A
hyperbola
is a conic section with an eccentricity of greater than one. The general equation of a hyperbola is
