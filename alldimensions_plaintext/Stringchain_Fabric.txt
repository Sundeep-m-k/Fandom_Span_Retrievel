Stringchains or Stringchain Fabric
Contains:
Tiny particles that allow it to chain with other Stringchainverses and form Stringchains and Stringchain Fabric
Stringchain Fabric is a kind of extremely large kind of fabric formed by infinite verses yet tiny in comparison to the
Omniverse
, which contain even tinier particles that sometimes are contained by two of these verses at once.
Stringchainverses

Stringchainverses are verses with size "

" which is supposed to mean an infinite value inaccessible from standard arithmetic with numbers 1 to
ω
−
1
{\displaystyle \omega_{-1}}
. They contain very tiny particles which don't seem to be too special, they just exist in Stringchainverses. This is until you find out that they can sometimes be contained in 2 Stringchainverses at once. This causes the areas that the Stringchainverses occupy to physically overlap, and since the chaining particle cannot escape either of them, the Stringchainverses are chained together. These Stringchainverses usually contain only 2 different chaining particles, and on rare occasions even 3, allowing them to create fabrics for abnormally large cosmic entities.
The Chains
[
]
The chains formed are usually large, as Stringchainverses usually have 2 chaining particles. They are very strong, nearly impossible to break apart, non-reactive, and don't take much force to bend single chains. Either by advanced civilizations, or naturally, these chains can have a Stringchainverse with 3 chaining particles, thus allowing it to split in multiple directions. Artificially, they can be chained together with 3 chaining particles in a formation that form larger "strings" that are even stronger. They can also be chained to make fabrics for large cosmic entities. The best thing is that they can fold easily.
