Unknown String
is the 3rd and most elusive part which makes up
Glitchonicite
. It is responsible for Glitchonnicite's other properties that aren't reality warping and reality clipping.
Unknown String is thought to be the part of Glitchonicite which formed first, as it seems to have influenced the development of
Glitchy String
and
Chaotic Wire
. However, no conclusive evidence has been found yet which supports this claim.
Unknown string is the only part of Glitchonicite which is not composed of
Uqraek fibers
; instead, it is made out of a strange particle able to form bonds with literally anything, including empty space.
Research conducted on Unknown String proved it was first created when a piece of very glitchy
Toxicium
glitched through
Yanox
while also being affected by it, creating Unknown String.
Yanox
[
]
Yanox is the thing, that eats everything coming close to it's path. It can destroy you faster than you can blink. Look closely, it's that! The white core of nothingness. It can suck up everything, even as small as an atom! AVOID THIS WHITE CIRCLE!!!!
Yanox is often attributed to the creation of the first
Unknown String
, the thing which most likely formed the element of Glitchonicite.
