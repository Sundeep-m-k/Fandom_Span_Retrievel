Ceronius
is an EXTREMELY Large Planet In Our Multiverse. It is Also The Largest One before
Superplanets
Begin. The reason why it is so large is because It has a lot of Uronium, Which is an element that prevents things from collapsing on itself. It also has Around 400 Million Moons due to it's massive Size and Gravitational Pull. It also can sustain life because In it's Universe, Tons of stars are incredibly large. However, despite it's size, a civillization called The Delegongs somehow managed to conquer it, but it only took Trillions of Years for them to do it. The Delegongs still have not fully used all of Ceronius's Energy. This means that they have a 0.78 on The Kardashev Scale, slightly more advanced than Regular Humans. They have made a lot of structures, like the Temple of Khonus, The Cebium Tower, and The Hugulum Torusium. it's atmosphere is also extremely large, going up to an entire Light Year around it. It's gravity is also 4.3x Stronger Than Earth's Gravity, making Life on Ceronius hard to live on. It also has several Superoceans, most of which are so deep that at the very bottom of those oceans, water gets so unimaginably dense that it turns into Hyperionic Ice, which is ice that is so heavy and compressed, that it almost can form a black hole, but it cant because it has a lot of Uronium in it. The Planet is so large, that is Ceronius was the Size of Earth, It would only be 25 Centimeters. Which is INCREDIBLY Small in comparison to Earth.
