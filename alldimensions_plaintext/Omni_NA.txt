Omni NA
is the second-to-last type of NA, and it are a very unique type of verse. This verse holds many mysterious secrets.
The shining light in the middle of the Omni NA is the only place where
Ultra NAs
are found, and this part of the Omni NA is extremely dense and hard to navigate. The rest of the Omni NA is almost entirely void, with a shell protecting the center light. The voids are home to the Yiik people. While its voids are warm, they are devoid of any particles (apart from the Yiik people's) and often erase rogue particles.
The shell is almost entirely transparent and is extremely difficult to damage. The material is is made out of is very similar to diamond in toughness, but it also stretches like a rubber band and is self-repairing.
Yiik
[
]
The Yiik are people who live in the voids of Omni NA, who they do not need to breathe or eat. They are somewhat aggressive and extremely xenophobic. Their appearances are humanoid, though their bodies are covered with scales or feathers depending on the subspecies. They have superhuman abilities, having a much larger amount of power and speed than regular humans, but they rarely use this power due to their isolation in the voids of Omni NA. They are able to clump individual atoms and split the protons, neutrons, and electrons, rearranging them to form the materials that they desire.
