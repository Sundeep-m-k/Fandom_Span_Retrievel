How we can escape from a statue?
[
]
Here is some tricks to escape from a Horse Statue:
- Glitching out of it
- Making a hole that connects the inside of the statue to the outside (Most dangerous way)
- Teleporting (Safest way)
If you escape using the 2nd option you can even doom all inside the Statue, so its not recommended.
