Superloops
Size
Beyond the concept of size to an unfathomable extent.
Dimensionality
Beyond the concept of dimensionality to an unfathomable extent.

Superloops are loops vastly

beyond all other loops. They are completely and utterly unreachable by any lower loops. They appear to have the same types of loops as normal loops (though on a much greater scale of course). They have a Loop Index beyond

what the loop index can measure!

Hyper- and Ultraloops
[
]
The difference in size between Superloops and
Hyperloops
is vastly
[

]
greater than the difference between the 0th Loop and Superloops. This difference is vastly
[

]
greater when comparing the size difference between Hyperloops and Ultraloops. We can measure these

loops using the Superloop Index. A Superloop has a Superloop Index of 1, a
Hyperloop
has a Superloop Index of 2, an Ultraloop has a Superloop Index of 3, so on and so forth.
Super-Superloops
[
]
An unconfirmed level of loop, these loops would be far beyond
[

]
what the Superloop Index can measure! Although not confirmed, research has hinted at a high probability of these existing. There could also be loops
even
bigger

than these already unfathomably big

loops!

Used for ease of understanding. Though it should be noted that how the word "big" is used in this article should be regarded in a similar way to how "vastly" is used in this article.
