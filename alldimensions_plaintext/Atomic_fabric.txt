This is the "thing" that makes up
ATSL
Uqraek fiber
.
As it is so small, it is insanely unstable.
Atomic fabrics
[

]
do not have a naturally forming repulsive barrier. And due to its instability, it will violently explode into countless pieces of itself. Which can corrupt and destroy everything near it, even
ver
ses
if it came to contact with.

⌬Why espec
ially "Atomic"
fabric and
what a
re they?
[
]
You see, even removing all physics-generated
ato
ms
[
3
]
and
ATSL
atoms
from everywhere of reality still leaves it with tons of smaller, "atom"-like particle networks. And those atoms are more fragile than any normal atoms and ATSL atoms. But small size does not grant them any ability to ignore physics rules!
Fragile atoms are bound with little energy that may be available for them. Little tickle,
large
boom
. The boom is totally not similar to the normal disassembly of atoms where particles turn into pure energy
[

]
. Space, along with particles and everything else, becomes super fragile. Atomic fabric is made from fragile space being destroyed by the motion of atoms.
⌬Is a
tom
ic fab
ric
useful?
[
]
...Nah. Atomic fabric is just a
head
ache
for eve
rything
[
5
]
, and it is almost
completely
useless
. Although Atomic fabric helps
some
very special artifacts of nature, it is not intentional. so yeah, the atomic fabric is rare but trollers to everything around it, like
moolah
verse
.
anyways, what they DO help are majorly large and infinite-scaled artifacts like rare types of
box
es
. Unlike verses that are easily destroyed by Atomic fabric, box sorts are structures, and their borders are much more stron⑨er than verse borders. Atomic fabric explodes into an infection fragment randomly, bouncing off the structure border to destroy any verses trying to collide with the structure.

These are just atoms like our universe's atoms, but instead of composing matters in our universe, they compose matters in other verses.
