A
TOBA Particle
, AKA
the-One-Below-All Particle
or
Particolos
are the building blocks of
Tiny Particles
and everything (except nothing). We can't see it because of it's size, but we discovered it by some unknown circumstances.
These particles are almost infinitely small, but they're super strong too. They can make things very tough (if you know how), and can't be destroyed, even by moderate level gods.
You can see, this page is extremely similar to
this page
, because it has everything that it have, except the tinyness of a TOBA Particle.
