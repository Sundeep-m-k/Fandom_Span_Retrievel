Properties
[
]
The Gem of Deception can NOT edit pages and can NOT change text in a wikia. This verse is very, very freezing cold and contains around 10
Gems of Understanding
. This verse represents trust and true honor to every verse that has this as their core, and it is the reason that trust exists. The reason why
The Gem of Understanding
isn't bigger than it is because this gem is almighty and actually sentient, meaning it's constantly growing.
Stability
[
]
This verse is very, very stable, even more so than
The Gem of Understanding
. In fact, it doesn't even shoot out anything! It's so stable that everything inside it is moving nowhere and the temperature inside it is BELOW absolute zero.
