Recording Begins
V: Hello.
N: Hi.
V: We just want to ask you a question.
N: Go ahead, what is it?
V: Is there an end to the verses?
N: No, there is no end. There are an unending number of verses, each bigger than the last. Even if a verse is completely unreachable, there will be something after it. Even if it transcends any hierarchies, even if it's the final verse without a doubt, there will be things that come after it. That is The Cosmic Truth you see, for there is no end to the cosmos.
V: Thank you for your time and the information you gave us, but for now we will end the interview.
