The
Hyperomegaverse
is a very large, transfinite
spiralverse
, at a size comparable to the highest-level
archverses
(
Infiniteverses
).
This verse contains an infinite amount of
Omegaverses
and transfinite in size, but is still part of the
Omniverse
.
In the Hyperomegaverse, there exist spiral structures of
universes
resembling galaxies, but on a much larger scale. These are connected together in a structure made of filaments and bright nodes.
The dimensionality of the Hyperomegaverse is unknown, its mass is transfinite and/or undefined.
In the high-dimensional space between universes, there reside infinite empty voids.
