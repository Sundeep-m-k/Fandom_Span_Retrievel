Nothing Axion
is a subkind of Class 3
Axions
, known to construct
the lower-hierarchy of nullity
in nullology mathematics. These axions are abstractly
nothing
in size, but look different in other abstraction. They are entirely decomposed and absented in one way, and are "truths" of null / false predicates.
Nothing Axions are also assumed to have an "absent" property in any stable metaphysical section, regardless of physical and abstraction. They also defy from axion genomes, and never take up space in any abstract dimension.
False Predicates
[
]
Abstraction in Nothing Axion is fully absent from others, and are assumed to be "false" predicates. False predicates are later interacted with
Micro-Axions
to build up proofs for true predicates and setup set and type theories.
Null Predicates
[
]
Basic nullity operators are constructed by themselves, directing to decomposable "nulls" in type theory. They are then scrambled in order to setup a hierarchy, in order to make type theory assume different "null" types. At this hierarchy, what one way can contain is assumed null at higher-levels, regardless of signs, orders, and sets.
For example, one kind of nullity doesn't occupy a value, and another kind pretends to be "nonexistent." The scarcest scale of Nothing Axion is not even close to
Nonons
; as designated as null. They indirectly contains it by assuming a "containment" definition by higher-scale Axions.
Nothing Axions keep track of null, and how it interacts with nothingness in abstraction. Phenomenal glitches in abstraction are made of alt-null assumptions, and not definitely false nor null in any way.
