The Absolute Cube
is basically the 'cubest' a cube can be. More formally, it is the closest you can be to a perfectly accurate cube, so all other cubes are less like the  idea of a 'cube' or are exactly just as accurate. Because of this, The Absolute Cube is very geometrically stable.
Absolute Cubes also tesselate, which can form many larger-scale structures, like
The Absolute Truth
. When tessellated, Absolute Cubes can store information extremely efficiently, and the faces

of Absolute Cubes are actually formed of a slightly lower-dimensional Absolute Cube, and it goes down infinitely (down ω levels), and the cube's edge lengths

getting slightly smaller each time, with the smallest being about

Planck lengths, but the exact value is currently unknown.
Composition

Inside The Absolute Cube's surface resides a single Absolute Octahedron, and the actual surface, as already said, is composed of Absolute Cubes.

Not actually faces because of having too many dimensions.
