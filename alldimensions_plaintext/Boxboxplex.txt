The
Boxboxplex
is a container of many, many different
Boxboxes
. They form a roof-like structure, but the structure isn't generated due to gravity or force, it is the structure the Boxboxplex happened to form into.
Every Boxbox contains every single type of box from smallest to largest, so there are many complexes of boxes in this structure.
Most of the Boxboxes tend to group together in clumps, which is why the orange dots look a lot bigger than normal Boxboxes. The clumps do not affect the behaviour of the Boxboxes.
