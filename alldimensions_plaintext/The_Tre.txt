The Tre
is, like its cousins
The Duo
and
The Un
, a bizarre verse, compared to others in the
Omniverse
. Every time an object touches the barrier of a Tre, that object dissolves into a pure
Blueprint Particle
soup. However, if an object made of primordium matter touches a Tre's barrier, it dissolves the entirety of the Tre's barrier, with the Tre being left without a barrier. Every Tre is 657 dimensional, which is often considered very arbitrary.
A Tre contains
Duos
,
Uns
,
Yottaverses
,
Vendekaverses
, and black holes. The black holes inside a Tre are often very massive

, usually being a few
Zettaverses
heavy at smaller masses, and several
Quettaverses
heavy at larger masses.
It is unknown how Tres form, as there are no known ways that a Tre would be able to form, sans intensive effort to make an artificial Tre-like verse.
