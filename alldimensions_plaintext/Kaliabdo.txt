Kaliabdo doesn't have many enemies. But there are some:
The Unknown Fool
:  A creature holding a knife in his hand as Kaliabdo accidentally entered his haunted supermarket just to shop. When Kaliabdo saw a creature coming towards him at 35km/h, Kaliabdo took out the red Among Us impostor in Amongus to kill The Unknown fool, when the Red impostor fired 5 shots from his gun, The Unknown fool started doing a Rick Roll dance while punching the bullets coming towards him until he got 1m away from Kaliabdo and the soldiers guarding Kaliabdo came to escape from that planet of TPOL because TuF was going to hit the planet 50 times and it would explode.
The Infinite Traveler:  He is also a dimension-traveling being who transformed Kaliabdo on the planet Seriphica into an Among Us one using an unknown substance. He kidnapped Kaliabdo and went to that planet using Glitchonicite
When Wenda ate KaliabdoðŸ’€
Wenda

Wenda

,
He stop it
,
The Second Coming
and
The Nirvanian
. But they were all lower than Wenda Sprunki because she was in the aboveÂ ???th Layer and they were all lower than her except The
Nirvanian
. But The Nirvanian responded to Kaliabdo, and erases her from the existence, but Wenda used Uno Reverse and The Nirvanian disappeared, then Wenda ate Kaliabdo and luckily Kaliabdo had some
Glitchonicite
in his hand to travel to later and escape to a random planet called Kepler-0.

A theoretical image of planet Kepler-0 ( The truth is that it looks like the Earth)
It is a habitable planet like Earth, but its diameter is the same as Earthâ€™s radius, 6371 km. Subtract 1001 km from it, and this gives us the diameter of the small planet, which is 5370 km. This is the diameter of Kepler-0.
