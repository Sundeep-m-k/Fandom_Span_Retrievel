About
[
]
The
False Transumreality
is a
verse
beyond the likes of verses such as the
Terminality of all Verses
, so that means this verse is the first one which uses a size unit that is known as a "Meta
number
", thus making them be categorized as a "
Metaverse
" (not to be confused with the
class 1
verses
of the same name).
This Metaverse was created so that everyone thinks that this is Transumreality, but it's nothing special apart from being the smallest Metaverse.
