The
Ultra Ultraverse
is a verse that contains
the Final Archverses
and other verses of similar properties to the
Ultraverse
. Just like how
the Final Box
looks very similar to a normal
Box
, for each
Ultraverse
there is a verse extremely similar to it, in fact an infinite number of each (including the verses contained within the previous verses).
The actual structure of
The Ultra Ultraverse
is very similar to a reglar
Ultraverse
, just like how
The Final Archverse
looks like a regular
Archverse
, and how
The Final Multiverse
looks like any other
Multiverse
.

Structure of The Ultra Ultraverse
[
]
The Structure of
The Ultra Ultraverse
is very alike and similar to an
Ultraverse
,
The Ultra Ultraverse
is very spherical and large, since it is made up of many dimensions and verses, the inside structure of The Ultra Ultraverse is very unorganised, with an immeasurable amount of verses scattered in random place, whereas the outside of
The Ultra Ultraverse
is the complete opposite, giving it that
spherical
shape.
The Creation of The Ultra Ultraverse
[
]
The Ultra Ultraverse
was formed about 10,000 OYC ago, it all started with the collision of a Final Archverse into another and so on....
The collision didn't stop for approximately 7,500 OYC until they all collided into one, forming one vast verse known as
The Ultra Ultraverse
, the collision created the formation of
The Ultra Ultraverse
, making it one big verse.
The Ultra Ultraverse
has in fact a very high density as the void percentage being at 75%, making it a very dense dimension or verse.
The temperature on
The Ultra Ultraverse
isn't classified, it's variable due to it's gargantuan size and how much verses it contains, making the temperature variable without any limit, but even if there was a vary in the temperature, big or small, it wouldn't be noticeable to most of the verses or dimensions inside it, because of how many verses
The Ultra Ultraverse
contains. This dimensions structure is quite simple, unlike verses with fractal structures, this one is sphereical and pretty unorganised inside.

This is the neighbour or brother of the
Ultraverse
