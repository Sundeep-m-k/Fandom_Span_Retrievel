Limits of Numbers
Beyond the Gasket that comprises the existence of finite numbers, there are an unfathomable amount of numbers which overcome the compression at the edge. These numbers that transcend reason and bounds are known as
Ordinals
.
After the finite numbers, the first ordinals appeared, represented as ω and ω x 2, they were existences at the very edge of reason and just barely transcended finite numbers. Just like there are sets of numbers at the finite scale, there are sets of ordinals at the infinite scale.
As operations were preformed to these numbers, they slowly grew outwards at a sickeningly slow pace, but then realization struck and a new number that transcended this puny cycle in the same way that ω did with finite numbers was created simply called
ω
1
{\displaystyle \omega_1}
. Although they didn't take up much space, each of the ordinal numbers represented yet another
Pentorb
, meaning that at this point there were lots of them.
ω
1
{\displaystyle \omega_1}
travelled a distance away from the edge of the Limit of Numbers equal to its radius, which was an astonishing feat given the law of diminishing returns on size that were present. Shortly after
ω
1
{\displaystyle \omega_1}
was created,
ω
2
{\displaystyle \omega_{2}}
was created, which was the same as
ω
1
{\displaystyle \omega_1}
but all of the ωs used in
ω
1
{\displaystyle \omega_1}
were replaced with
ω
1
{\displaystyle \omega_1}
.
This cycle continued until
ω
ω
{\displaystyle \omega_{\omega}}
which was around 0.75 times the diameter of
Limit of Numbers
away from its edge, where it stopped for about 60,000 seconds. Then someone had the great idea of making
ω
ω
1
{\displaystyle \omega_{\omega_1}}
, which was the
ω
1
{\displaystyle \omega_1}
st in the cycle, and his footsteps were soon followed, with
ω
ω
ω
{\displaystyle \omega_{\omega_{\omega}}}
and
ω
ω
ω
ω
{\displaystyle \omega _{\omega _{\omega }}^{\omega }}
being created just a few microseconds later, but even stacking all of these infinities only got them to a new barrier 2 times the length of the Limit of Numbers from end to end.
No matter what useless infinities were slapped on, they would mean nothing because of the law of diminishing returns. They needed something far more inaccessible than ω, they needed something beyond the ordinals, they needed something that was far more inaccessible than any of the infinities before, they needed
θ
.
