The Archierarchy
is a
hierarchical
project by
Archurricane
. It could be a collaboration project at any time.
Pre-Archlevel (-1) - Below Planck length
[
]
The Pre-Archlevel contains objects with side lengths no bigger than the Planck length: 1.616x10
-35
meters. Physical laws break at this stage.
Multiversal level
[
]
A multiversal planck length is 10
-107
meters long.
TSK-91028 - A mysterious entity about a googolth of an inch long.
Barboson - A particle that ranges from 10
-89
to 10
-87
meters in diameter.
The minimum possible size of a
galaxy
is 10
-80
meters in diameter. Below this size galaxies would collapse into a microscopic black hole.
Kerlon - A mysterious
tesseract
-shaped object about 10
-71
meters.
There is nothing noteworthy from 10
-69
to 10
-40
meters.
This is a WIP hierarchy so not everything's finalized. Also expect more objects to come!
