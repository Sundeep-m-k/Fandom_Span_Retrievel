It destroyed
Bongus
when
The Cosmological Recycler
was looking for Bongus and TCR found the copycat disguised AS Bongus and mistaked him as the real Bongus. The copycat knew what TCR was gonna do and quickly got out of the Bongus morph just in time.
It's true form is a white glowing sphere with black eyes and one is red that emits weird red circles that grow and fade overtime.
