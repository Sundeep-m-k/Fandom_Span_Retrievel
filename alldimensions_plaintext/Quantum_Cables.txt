Quantum cable
This is a quantum cable
Quantum cables are huge cables that are made out of dark matter. They are used to hold universes together and they can stretch infinitely without losing any mass as it stretches. It also has the same density when it stretches. When a universe is born, it doesn't have any quantum cables, so it expands insanely fast and is very hot, but soon develops quantum cables to hold the universe together, as a result, the size of a universe is determined by how many quantum cables it has. There is one exception to this however.
Inferno
verses never develop quantum cables to hold themselves together. As a result, they become insanely hot and the border of the verse becomes like a
gravastar
. They also are guaranteed to explode sometime in the future as the border cannot hold the universe together once it reaches a limit.  Quantum cables are manufactured by companies and nations to sell and to hold universes together.
