About
[
]
Chaos Entities
are
beings
that can only reside in realities such as the
Glitchyverse
. They're made entirely of
Glitch Matter
.
They're a kind of creature you wouldn't want to touch, unless you want your
quarks
get disassembled, your liquids transformed into a Bose-Einstein condensate or anything similar. Of course Chaos Entities can collide with eachother without consequences, though.
Kardashev scale
[
]
Despite not having any technology, (or at least a working one) their presence and control over their entire reality classifies them as a Type IV
civilization
.
