The codeverse is a verse typed "containerverse" the reason for that is, you probably guessed it, because of the name, it contains all codes, errors every piece of a byte in the computer, memory and thing, the verse itself has no life on it except numbers moving from side to side, the numbers that move are 0 - 1, the numbers are like that because the founder of this verse (octip) said its means two things: 0 - stuff that is empty; when containing bytes of stuff on the computer, the 0's turn to 1's meaning that 0's dont have anything inside them and 1's have a byte, code, error or anything else in them.

codeverse also has many unicque stuff like: colors, colors are showing when the system is doing actions,
Red - system down
Green - system normal
yellow - unknown error
and that is the colors, some say it appears on all the verse itself because its a critical error, but its appears on the radius of its own by 0.5 x.

KB (kilobyte) usually contains small amount of info, like 1 - 2 rows of codes or computer parts.
MB (megabyte) mostly contains some info, like 2 - 8 rows of codes or A-15+ motherboards.
GB (gigabyte) contains usually 8 - 65 rows of codes or monitors, its sometimes close to contain a big computer, but thats too big for gigabytes.
TB (terabyte) contains most time computers or servers, that starts to get big.
PB (petabyte) can store 11,000 4k movies.
EB (exabyte) can store 4,965 8k movie theateres.
ZT (zettabyte) can store 30m fully developed games.
YB (yottabyte)  can store 100m petabytes sized servers.
BB (brontobyte) can store 4 - 5 codesystems.
Even bigger bytes:

WB (Wekabyte) can store 764 - 1945 codesystems.
QB (Quattabyte) can light all the galaxys in 3 universe copys of ours and can light a fraction of all galaxys in the codeverse.
CB (cetrabyte) can light a entire observable universe of ours
LB (letabyte) can light an entire codeverse, that is too big for the verse and thats why they are in stuff called "sizecells".
UB (urabyte) can destroy a entire
barrel
.
OB (orabyte) can destroy 67,000 barrelplexes.
JB (jattabyte) close to the size of graham's number.
NB (nettabyte) can light a entire omniverse.
HB (hikkabyte) can destroy a
BOX
.
Largest bytes ever

VB (Vertabyte) can destroy 74
BOXES
.
RB (rexaebyte) can destroy the
brox
.
XB (Xbyte) can destroy
ultra-box
and is the largest byte in the space.

Codecells

Basic info
[
]
a codecell (aka cc) is a cell-container of the parts,bytes and stuff into a one large cell, floating around the codeverse, its contains every thing until its out of space, some are bigger, some are smaller, for better explanation here it is:

Weakcell - usually contains from kilobytes to zetabytes.
Midcell - usually contains from zettabytes to orabytes.
Strongcell - usually contains from orabytes to Xbytes.
Megacell - usually contains from sednabytes to abraxibyte
Ultracell - contains abraxibytes and d(̵̛̙͕̲̯̊̈́̈̈́̓̃̀̔̍̎̅̋̓̐̎͐̿̈̔̊̏̈́̋̃͂͒̅̃͗́̽̔͗̑̈́̈́̅̾̉͗̊̚͝͝͝͝͝͠bytes.
