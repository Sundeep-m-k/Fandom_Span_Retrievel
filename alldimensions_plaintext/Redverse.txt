The
Redverse
is an average-sized
Universe
, but with a special property: It's red E V E R Y W H E R E . Galaxies? Red. Living beings? Red. Stars? Red. Planets? RED!!! You got it now, right? Even the name is red, like how?!
It also has an extreme temperature, the average temperature being 40°C everywhere, so humans are unable to live here.
The only beings that live in this verse that we know of are the Redians, entities with a Kardashev scale of 4, being, if other civilizations do exist, the largest civilization in all of the Redverse.
It's just complete redness, everywhere and anywhere...
