Karano
is the universe
Stella Nova
resides in. It is incredibly small, around the size of an average house. It was created by
the man of Fate
to be a home for Stella and isolate her from the outside world. It is dark, but light clouds fly about throughout it. The clouds are debris emanating from Stella herself. The universe has no ground, everything that enters just floats.
