Structure
[
]
The cubes contain 7 parts, which are called the outer shell, inner shell, protector, primordial road networks, primordiostructures, corner entrances and anti-destroyer system.
Outer Shell
[
]
The outer shell is a structure made out of infiniglass (indestructible glass), which all living things can't get out of the cube.
Inner Shell
[
]
The inner shell is made out of an unknown material. It is guarded by CCTV cameras, security alarms and guns the size of a Primordiolis. No living thing has gotten out of the inner shell.
Protector
[
]
It is the core of the Primordial Cube. It keeps the cube stable from destroying and disintegrating. It contains countless living things inside the protector. The protector was constructed countless infinite+ OYC ago when the core of the Primordial Cube is hijacked by an unknown entity.
Primordial Road Networks
[
]
This thing is made out of absolute indestructible asphalt and all roads will not get a traffic jam because the road is so big that it can stretch 15 primordiolis.
Primordiostructures
[
]
It is the material of the cube. It contains many and many Primordiolis. They connect through primordial road networks with a parking lot the size of 5 primordiolis.
Corner Entrances
[
]
Only the living things with at least 10^10^40 dollars (wealthy) can leave and enter a Primordial Cube. It is also guarded with CCTV, guns, anti-hijacking systems and security alarms.
Anti-Destroyer System
[
]
It contains a lot of security and keeps the cube from hijacking. So far, no one is allowed to hack any primordial cube. it is impossible as far as we know.
