The master of everything, also known as "akihiko" is a NOT imaginary Thing, it is real, akihiko Can do everything he wishes by saying it (explanation: "CREATE OMNIVERSE" creates a omniverse), akihiko family is powerful, some less and some more, akihiko's name is from the meaning of japanese: red, They (Dad & Mom) called him like that because every time he creates or destroy something, a spark appears colored red, meaning hes name "red".
Downsides & Upsides
[
]
Being a god of anything seems pretty fun and boring, it is not the two of them believe me, you would say: "bruh if he can wish anything he can kill them" true, but remember he have to say it, before he can, they start attacking him leading to his powers to get disabled, the get disabled for 100Ω years, he could easily set time 100Ω years, only the fact it would destroy everything.. he have to think on another idea like: enable my powers or time 100Ω back time 100Ω, but hes infact so old (72452952965638463866459249652439652060370309780902959262384Ω yrs old) that thinking is not his strong thing, hes still a child but, hes still very old, making him a child that can talk slowly (3 minutes to complete a thing), he would normally just say "old me 10" or something like that, but it will destroy him, so hes staying like he is.
