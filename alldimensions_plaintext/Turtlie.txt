Turtlies
are any number of cosmological objects, vastly ranging in size from sub-universal to universal, based on the famous saying, "it's turtles all the way down". They can a collection of lower-level
Turtlies
, being made of even smaller ones and so on, except if they are the lowest-level
Turtlie
, the
Planet
. Higher-level
Turtlies
are always made of the previous level, except if they are a Planet.
There is also a measurement system used by many civilizations within The Infinite Cosmology that starts with T-0 (Planet), T-1 (Star System), etc. This is a set of values corresponding with their objects:
Pre-Normal Turtlies
[
]
These turtlies is class 0 or lower classes, so they is not big. At orders, they are reversed (highest is -1, lowest is -ω).

Note
Tier -1

500Km - 5,000Km
The variants of moons. They orbit not every turtlies tier 0 (planet)s.
Tier -2
Continent
100Km - 500Km
They not apper on every planets.
Tier -3
Country
5Km - 100Km
Contries may be over 100Km, meaning they is at size of tier -2, tier -1.

They may not appear in every Contries.

Star System can have any amount of stars, up to 3 rarely!

Type 3 civilizations can control over this entire system.

This may be the limit of our civilization, no matter how far you go.

Galaxy clusters are grouped with other clusters in superclusters.

T-6
Tublaxa
50,000,000,000 LY - 500,000,000,000 LY
The common universes can't have
Tublaxas
because they're not big enough to fit one. Only "bigger universes" can.

Omniverses

The Turtlie
ranking system is has the same essence as the EUSI, the differences being, that the
Turtlie
counts the amount of nested systems, instead of physical containments, and doesn't include an array as its input.
The Turtlie
rank should theoretically begin with T-0 being a moon, but not all planets have moons, and if we include moons, there is nothing stopping moons from also having moons, and triple nested moons, and so on. This could theoretically be described as
T
−
(

ω
)
{\displaystyle T-(-\omega)}
, but the author didn't intend for this originally, so it is unofficial yet.
