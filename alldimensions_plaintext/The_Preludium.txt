The Preludium is a verse that exists as the first
Meta-Class 10
verse. The size of this verse is calculated using
Ultrafinite Power
, and with a Metavsaue (
ℵ
Λ
{\displaystyle \aleph\Lambda}
), to get the number Ω
UFP=
ℵ
Λ
{\displaystyle \aleph\Lambda}
.
Description of the Verse
[
]
First thing you need to know about this, this verse is
really
hot. This verse reaches temperatures hotter than a Metavsaue (
ℵ
Λ
{\displaystyle \aleph\Lambda}
). There are certain suits created by
Metasm
that allows one to explore this verse. This verse has many strings that you can walk on, which do not have to many obstacles. Each string is equally as long as the next one. In the center of the verse, a ball made of these strings is formed. This place is very claustrophobic, however it is not very dangerous (granted you have your suit on). In summary, this is not very dangerous if you have a heat resistant suit on.
Trivia
