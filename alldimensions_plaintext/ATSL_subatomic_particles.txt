ATSL Subatomic Particles are various kinds of small and fragile particles forming from collapses of protoverses. They are little tiny dangerous specs of dust that sometimes
explode and dam
age nearby space

These little tiny particles' formation process has something to do with the
proto
verse
. Of course, if every single protoverse can go Big Bang,
everywhe
re you go
, you will only see verses after verses after verses. And that's NOT what space looks like. This means not every protoverse can go big bang... actually, close to none of them considering the number of protoverses which can!
Protoverses are not eternal and get destroyed by various factors easily. For example, protoverses lose initial formation energy very slowly until they vanish
out of ex
istence
. Or in more extreme cases, even colliding with a random particle can absorb protoverse and destroy it.
Among the objects hungry for the energy of protoverse, some may gain a tiny bit of energy before getting destroyed. The probability of that happening is pretty much smaller than the x button on
mobil
e ADs
(meaning the probability is close to infinitesimal), but when it happens, protoverse creates a rare particle upon its destruction: ATSL Subatomic Particles!
⌬The frag
ility of
ATSL
Subatomic
Particles
[
]
These particles are so small, that if they get pushed by any force, they will break apart into countless, no-size particles (commonly to particles at
⎊
Null class
(-1)
⎊
of
The Pre-
Hierarchy
) instantly. Only the weak electromagnetic barriers surrounding them are protecting ATSL subatomic particles from exploding.
One good news
[
2
]
is that forces are very hard to influence these little tiny
space
beans
. Imagine placing a smol patch of fabric and gigantic metal plate against an
insanely power
ful storm
. Of course, the metal plate breaks first. Like that case, ATSL Subatomic Particles are super fragile but have to withstand less energy.
And now, the good news for everything else: even if subatomic particles explode, it basically does not affect its surroundings because explosion only creates no-size particles such as
Blueprint

tic
les
sort and
s
o

. Obviously, they cannot affect anything with no-size particles... right...?

[

Ahhh... yes... lightweight destructive particles ruin everything. Among the clouds of no-mass particles (such as
Xey
ons
and
the
⬤
[

]
), lightweight (meaning it has at least a small mass) particles (something like
tinypa
rticle
) get mixed into the cloud to meet the outer world.
Most are fine, but the problem is that not all particles are kind angels. Some
do not really accept the existen
ce of another particle around them
, and some refuse to not explode. The worst ones just hate to accept its existence itself! Below lists three bad particles that turn ATSL subatomic particle explosions into a blizzard of dangerous particles
[

:
⌬
Tinyparticles
(No.1
destruction source)
: Tinyparticles are dangerous particles. Usually, (following only random probability) they build strong networks composing an absolutely uncountable number of Tinyparticles. However, if they are arranged in forbidden shapes, the whole network of Tinyparticles ignites and
expl
odes
.
You see, lots of Tinyparticles form when ATSL subatomic particles
expl
ode
. Many safely bonds with each other, and does not become a problem. Of course, some nasty ones bond in the wrong way. An instant explosion from those networks destroys pretty much everything around the explosion site and fills destroyed space with a bunch of new tinyparticles
[
5
]
.
⌬
Neutrons (No.2
destruction source)
: This time, the neutron is not ATSL. Explosion commonly creates neutron-sort of particle which has no positive or negative charge and composed of 3 particles. Except... that neutron here is
a li
ttle
smaller compared to what we are used to.
There are many ways these "neutrons" can form. if there is a group of particles
[
6
]
with a total charge of 0
[
7
]
, then it is a super-tiny neutron
[
8
]
! They can now shrink or expand to death, or somehow
cancel out other ne
utrons like itself
to be annihilated to form new neutrons. Along with
tinypa
rticles
, neutrons are huge headaches for near particles.
⌬
Energy particles (No.3
destruction source)
: At the event
[
9
]
where even the tiniest bits of particles become destructive, energy particles themselves are now like
shards o
f Karens
spreading everywhere on the internet
[
10
]
. Clouds of energy particles rush outward, striking everything and shredding them into no-mass particles.

Well of course for particles

actually there are

for particles around the explosion site of course

Like, really obviously, newely-filled Tinyparticles will cause few extra explosion.

It is not really important whether the particle is

by canceling out each other's charge. For example, if there are a group of particles with 1 million negative charge and 1 million positive charge, result is very big neutron and of course this sort of neutron is close to impossible to occur at explosion of ATSL subatomic particles.

a barrier enveloping 0-charge particle group automatically forms

the explosion obviously

meaning they are very destructive and dangerous
