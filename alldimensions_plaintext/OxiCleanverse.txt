The OxiCleanverse is a -verse where almost nothing exists. This is because everything has too much filth, due to Mays' laws.
When they don't have OxiClean, they are dirty.
There will always be filth connected to a currently clean particle, however, it does not directly affect that particle's current state of cleanliness due to being separated by probability.
The leftover particles of clothes that were cleaned with OxiClean during their lifespan will reform in this verse.
