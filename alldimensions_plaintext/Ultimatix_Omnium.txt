The Ultimatix Omnium
An Infium is an abstract, paradoxical entity that embodies the amalgamation of all things, all categories, all characters, all concepts, and even the notions of "other," "beyond," and "etcetera." It defies classification because it is every classification simultaneously, object and idea, identity and environment, self and multitude. An Infium is not just everything, it is the concept of everything-ness itself, encompassing contradictions, opposites, undefined terms, impossible states, and even what lies beyond comprehension. Where most things are something, an Infium is all somethings and all nothings at once. THIS is important to know since The Ultimatix Omnium contains a innumerable amount of infiums in one nanoparticle, yes a nanoparticle of The Ultimatix Omnium (these nanoparticles are called the Penultimatix Infinitus) and EACH pi contains a innumerable amount of infiums and innumerable usually means "countless, infinite, innumerous, multitudinous, myriad, numberless, uncounted, unnumberable, unnumbered, unnumerable. incalculable." However we are using a concept called True Innumerablity which is beyond any type of idea of Numberical sets(basically think of something infinite like a infinite universe, however this infinite universe is contained by a infinite multiverse which ideally is higher), The Ultimatix Omnium is a collection of all infiums EVER! even existence and non existence and every version of reality itself, and The Ultimatix Omnium even contains all of
the pillars of the eternal creation
and infiums outside and beyond that, but what does "outside" mean in The Ultimatix Omnium?
