This index is a way to more easily comprehend the place in the hierarchy of verses that are extremely large, self containing, or paradoxical.
The numbers on this index represent the amount of verses contained by a particular verse.
As a example, the SRI (Stormy's Reality Index) of a
Universe
is Î©, because it contains a infinite amount of
Protoverses
.
Worried that the result will bring out insanely large numbers? We can solve this by making the word (Universe) represent that large number on the scale, like this: (Universe)x2. This uses verses like measurement units.
Interesting things I noticed with this:
[
]
I could not define the end number on this index for
The Box
or
Berryverse
. This is because they are self containing, containing themselves both directly and indirectly. However, we can still use the names of the verses to represent this unknown quantity.
Relationships between different values.
[
]
Due to the index counting how many verses are contained by a verse, we can draw relationships to verses and civilizations on different values, because verses are very distinct from each other.

Civilisations
Verses
1x(Universe)
Civilizations at this level often have advanced portal
or teleportation technology, being able to traverse possibly thousands,
if not millions of light years.
Verses at this level are generally very stable, and are home to the majority of life.
1x(Multiverse)
Civilisations at this level usually have extremely advanced teleportation technology, and often use entire universes for energy.
Verses on this level are usually stable, because they rely so much on the verses they contain.
