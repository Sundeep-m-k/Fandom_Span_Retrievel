About the warehouse
[
]
The
Primordial Warehouses
or PWs for short are large warehouses containing many, many
Primordial Baskets
and recently many
Primordial Factories
due to a recent expansion. They are controlled by a large union of robot workers that sort massive amounts of baskets into very large shelves containing similar baskets. The PWs are just a place for baskets to be stored before they are sent to basket stores across the
Primordial Cities
, where they are up for either free purchase or very cheap purchase due to the sheer number of baskets, causing their prices to constantly go down to the point where they are millions of times cheaper than uranium /
Toxicium
.
Structure
[
]
The structure of the PW chron-basket is like this: There are many primordial factories on one end of the warehouse, and these produce many baskets, which are sent onto one conveyor which makes them travel at super fast speeds. They then get special properties, which is where the robot workers come in. The robot workers put many, MANY baskets of the same properties onto huge carts, which they then push the contents of onto shelves depending on their properties (shelves will only contain baskets of one special property) and then they come back to do the same thing with more and more carts. This would cause basket flooding but there are tons of very fast robots to quickly move these to their shelves. Due to the risk of basket theft, there are anti teleporting devices in the PW which prevent anything from teleporting, even the robot workers. They solved this by making them move at fast speeds. Tangent over.
Basket Vault
[
]
There's also a basket vault which is where NFS / NFR baskets are preserved, usually rare ones. There are 375,000,000 preserved baskets in the vault.
unionizing
[
]
An union of bots was formed but it got destroyed and now the warehouse is 1984.
Entities
[
]
Robot workers
[
]
All info on them has been shown previously, they are the most common workers in the PWs.
Vault guards
[
]
Vault guards protect the basket vault, which is where certain baskets are preserved forever (rare ones mostly but also common ones are frozen at below a-0 speeds).
Him

Him is just a really large hyperdog. He's sittin' there.
