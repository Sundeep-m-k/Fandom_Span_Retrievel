The Big Rigs Truck, The Destroyer Of Universes
Age
23, manufactured in 1998
Knowledge
Not much. Dude who drives it is a fuckin redneck.
Power
One. To devour universes. It needs no more.
Goals
None.
It's name is never spoken by any god, let alone mortal. At The Creator's mere thought of it, the Omniverse trembled in one feeling. Fear.
A being so
insurmountably, incomprehensibly, bewilderingly, unfathomably
powerful, that within an unfathomably short fraction of a z
epto-second
, entire universes are demolished at sub-atomic levels. The gods that have, with an inch of their life left, managed to bring a message to the rest of the universe, have named it. That name is something no mortal dare to utter in the presence of the immortal.
The Big Rig.
The Big Rig is the most powerful being that will ever exist. It travels at 12.3 undecillion miles per hour. In any given universe, it exists in every single position at once, destroying everything in an instant. And when it does that? It merely moves onto the next victim. We should all be graceful that is restricted only by the vastness of our reality. We should all learn to respect it's supreme authority. It's supreme power over
fate itself
.
We should all kneel before it.
