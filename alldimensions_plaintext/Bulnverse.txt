Properties
[
]
The Bulnverse has an infinitesimal size, with the size being approximated at 78.612ε.
The Bulnverse is a 0-dimensional verse, but when projected onto a 2D plane, it appears to be a square-like shape with rounded corners colored teal, lime, and blue. Due to the verse's small size, images of it projected are very low quality.
The Bulnverse, due to being 0-dimensional, does not contain anything apart from stray
Hecks
, and even then, those are rare.
It was discovered in 233
OYC
by Ɯkƕi Buln, which is where the name comes from.
Is that it?
Alright, finally.
