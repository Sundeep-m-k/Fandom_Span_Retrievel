A
Penteract
is a type of
verse
that is shaped like a
penteract
, AKA a 5D
cube
. It has very similar functionality to the
Tesseracts
, being built from many
Archrealities
of
Back to back to realities
on top of each other. Catching images of any Penteract rotating, or even just a Penteract at all is
extremely
difficult, and so a proper image of one has not been made yet.

We do know from eyewitness accounts that the Penteracts are visible through the eyes of a
living thing
, although through any camera (except Negaspectral cameras) they're completely invisible. That is because they're seen via the NS (negaspectral) light. Apparently, they look very similar to the Tesseracts, just with twice as many points. They also cannot be detected with ship verse detection technology, and so there was nearly a crash when one of them was first entered.
