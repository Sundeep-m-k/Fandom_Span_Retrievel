Introduction
[
]
The
Universe
is an elementary
verse
type, responsible of forming the basis of
containment hierarchies
. Universes within a
Multiverse
usually share common laws of physics, and systems of logic, but differ in initial starting conditions upon being formed, and thus have entirely different timelines.
Universes are not directly composed of other
archverses
; instead, they're composed of various cosmic structures, making it
absolutely verse
. Universes differ very vastly in size and average out in the 100 billion ly

Universe Border
[
]
The border of a Universe is located at the boundary of its sphere of law influence. Universes may not have physical borders, as in our Universe, whose boundary is pushed by dark energy continuously further away and the border is simply a cut-off for our law systems.
Universe borders, at least the ones similar to ours, have some sort of a negative attractive force that repels objects once they come close enough to the Universe. This causes a hill-like bend in spacetime, encircling the entire Universe in equal amplitude, and the line connecting all maximum negative attraction points is used as the official boundary and border.
Universes expand their border by various methods, most unnamable due to language limitations, but Universes in our large general vicinity are expanded by a force that either acts solely on the border, or one that occurs naturally but also interacts with the border as well.
Borderless Universes, those in the form of
LNB-2n
, usually lose their border rather than having it be absent from the Universes very conception. This does not mean that the Universe's laws influence indefinitely far, as in, being borderless, but that they don't end abruptly but fizzle out. These types of Universes don't exactly have any special phenomena happing at the "fuzzy area" that could implicate a border either, but one can see from a far that the Universe's structures simply fizzle out after a certain distance from the center.
Our Universe
[
]
Our Universe
is a 600 billion light-year
LNB-7
which was created 13.8 billion years ago. It grows very slowly in size, however, its growth is still faster than light speed, due to the potential of dark energy.
Its laws of physics include: the
Law of Gravitation
(objects attract each other with a force directly proportional to the product of the masses of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them)
,
Newton's laws of Motion
,
Coloumb's law
(force between the two electric charges reduces to a quarter of its former value when the distance between them is doubled)
,
Kepler's law
(each planet revolves round the Sun in an elliptical orbit with the Sun at one focus)
,
Law of Conservation of Energy
(energy can neither be created nor destroyed)
,
General Relativity
(each planet puts space curvative, makes space and time relative to each other, and make time dilation possible dependent to speed of light)
,
Dark Energy
(likely a law which is the cause of the acceleration of expansion)
, and more.
Elementary particles
include
quarks
,
gluons
,
leptons
, and
bosons
. Together they construct protons and neutrons, which finally make up atoms, who are the building blocks of nearly everything in the Universe. (With the exception of dark matter). Atoms together clump up to form molecules; the arrangement of atoms in these molecules are what create very unique and chaotic solids, gasses, and liquids. A great example of this phenomena are crystals.
There are 4 fundamental forces that make up everything: Weak (quarks and gluons), strong (nucleons), electromagnetism, and gravity.

Big Freeze

Big Rip

Big Slurp
- This theory posits that the universe currently exists in a false vacuum and that it could become a true vacuum at any moment.  In order to best understand the false vacuum collapse theory, one must first understand the Higgs field which permeates the universe. Much like an electromagnetic field, it varies in strength-based upon its potential. A true vacuum exists so long as the universe exists in its lowest energy state, in which case the false vacuum theory is irrelevant. However, if the vacuum is not in its lowest energy state (a false vacuum), it could tunnel into a lower-energy state. This is called
vacuum decay
. This has the potential to fundamentally alter our universe; in more audacious scenarios even the various physical constants could have different values, severely affecting the foundations of matter, energy, and spacetime. It is also possible that all structures will be destroyed instantaneously, without any forewarning.
Cosmic uncertainty
[
]
Each possibility described so far is based on a very simple form for the dark energy equation of state. However, as the name is meant to imply, very little is currently known about the physics of dark energy. If the theory of inflation is true, the universe went through an episode dominated by a different form of dark energy in the first moments of the Big Bang, but inflation ended, indicating an equation of state far more complex than those assumed so far for present-day dark energy. It is possible that the dark energy equation of state could change again, resulting in an event that would have consequences that are extremely difficult to predict or parametrize. As the nature of dark energy and dark matter remain enigmatic, even hypothetical, the possibilities surrounding their coming role in the universe are currently unknown. None of these theoretic endings for the universe are certain.
Types
[
]
An image of all the universe types (along with our own and the largest universe)
General
[
]
There are 4 main types of universes and 3 types of forming universe, the 4 main types are determined by how intense their big bang is:
Forming Types
[
]
1 Type
[
]
1 Types are the smallest Type of Universe and are a glowing white, for the first 300 Million Years of formation this is the type that the universe will be made.
2 Type
[
]
2 Types are warm reddish universes that have began quickly cooling down for the next 300 Million years, these universes slowly lose their heated glow.
3 Type
[
]
A Types
[
]
A types (also known as soot dwarves) are the smallest type of universe and have the smallest big bangs, some people call their big bangs “small bangs” but this name calling died out around 2021.
B Types
[
]
B types (also known as soot universes) are the most common type of universe, they have an average big bang and are freezing. They have a dark color and are freezing.
C Types
[
]
C types (also known as grey giants) are the largest universes (along with D types), they have such a huge big bang that they do not cool down to the freezing point, the average temperature inside these universes is room temperature. This universe creates
metasaungs.
D Types
[
]
D types (also known as black giants) are the largest universes (along with C types), they have the largest and most intense big bang, they do not cool down at all due to these massive big bangs, and thus their average temperature is as hot as lava. Also, can you imagine living in this universe? I hope the physics there aren't crazy.
Universe Collisions
[
]
Universes sometimes collide with each other.
There are multiple types of collisions
Small collisions
Big collisions
Intense collisions
Hyper
collisions
Insane collisions
