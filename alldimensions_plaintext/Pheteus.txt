He only
revives
necessarily, he doesn't really care about strange things he
see.
He believes in
peace and freedom
and lives in
White and Black Holes
. When he finds dark matter, he saves it just in case he loses limbs. His body is made out of dark matter. Inside his body is just
darkness
, his skin is also
pretty dense
. He might lose limbs during a fight with evil creatures, but he might
use
dark matter he find to
replace
his older limbs. But if he doesn't, it'll form again in a
few
weeks, like an
axolotl.
