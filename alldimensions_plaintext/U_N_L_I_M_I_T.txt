The U N L I M I T Is a considerably large verse contained by
HOSTLESS
. It contains entities known as
Pound Sterlings
, and about 8,000 of them live in the U N L I M I T (not counting verses inside it). It can only be reached through very advanced warping as exiting The True Waterfall is very difficult.
Structure
[
]
U N L I M I T can be classed as a semi-void due to the literal absence of any form of real material, except for 19
True Waterfalls
floating around. These True Waterfalls are spread unimaginably far away from each other, and have never collided due to their distance.
In order to be contained by
HOSTLESS
, U N L I M I T also self-contains beyond all imagination and nearly beyond explanation with all the time in the realm. These are noticably but not unimaginably different copies of U N L I M I T which go nearly beyond the ability to describe them, allowing for the last layer to be within
HOSTLESS
. All layers have similarly low density to the base.
