The
Torubarrier
is an extremely large barrier that contains one
Metatoriverse
. It is not green like the picture shows, there's no light emitted by it so it looks invisible.
The image of it seen on the infobox is actually taken with a special camera.
Getting past the barrier
[
]
The Torubarrier, while large, is very thin. It is made of a material that we currently do not think can be broken, because we haven't been able to take a sample to examine it.
It is possible to get past it, though. Currently, there's a wormhole that goes to the other edge of the Torubarrier. This happened because quantum teleportation is very common outside
Metatoriverses
when inside a torubarrier, and one side of a wormhole quantum teleported out of the Torubarrier. This is the only known way to get past it.

Different Shapes

Very rarely, Torubarriers can be other shapes than hyperspheres.
