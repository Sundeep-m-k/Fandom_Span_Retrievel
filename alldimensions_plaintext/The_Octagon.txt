OYC
ago, The Octagon was created after the Hyper Bang happened and only had dark matter with dark energy.
386.1 OYC later, it gained its first black holes, the smallest ones didn't survive for long, though.
Many years later, the biggest black hole collapsed and caused a lighter version of the Hyper Bang, creating The Octahedron in the middle of
The Octagon.
44.2 OYC later, The Octahedron created its own version of time and
The Octagon
created rocks (somehow). 356.6
OD
later, the rocks collided, making planets and asteroids.
1,132.6 OYC later, there were 65,000 planets so far, The Greatern and many others also got hit by a bunch of asteroids, which gave The Greatern Water.
1.25 OYC later, the planets started colliding, making many moons on the process.
57.3 OD later, the planet crisis started, as all planets that had life on them (even the simplest forms) were mysteriously losing resources, only planets like The Greatern were able to survive.
The planet crisis lasted until the birth of our
Universe
and then
The Octagon
remained in peace, and on the way, it was forever.
