A picture of a Hoang
Hoangs are things just like
sproyongs
but are way more destructive and are made of what looks like amethyst with what looks like
sentient substances
on it. They roam around the Xenoverse, destroying anything in their path. They are indestructible even with
Corruptite
cannons, although they can't reproduce and there are a limited number of them. The first one destroyed an Omniverse and made the first
Hyperadioactive elements
. It is unknown where these came from.
