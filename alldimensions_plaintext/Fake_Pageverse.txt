About
[
]
The
Fake Pageverses
(or
Fake Pages
) are, like their name indicates,
artificial
fake versions of the
Pageverses
, so they can be summarized as a separate type of the latters. They're made by
Transcendent Omni-Gods
, hence being classified as manmade verses.

Formation
At the time a page was created (any date)
Destruction

Lifetime
As long as the page exists without deleting or after undeleting (any age)
This type of
verse
itself has its color scheme inverted, because of being both a container of the
element
known as
Inversium
and as a way to make them easier to differentiate from the normal Pageverses appearance-wise for other TOGS. They might also be considered a bit
glitchy
, due to them being composed of
verses with a certain degree of corruption
.
Origins
[
]
Even though Fake Pageverses, their variants and other verses of the
Fake Wikiverse chain
CAN be generated naturally, this was possible AFTER Transcendent Omni-Gods first made them, as a way to make
civilizations
not go any further. Why? Because why not.
This also explains why Fake Pageverses are
self containing
: as a way to make the deceiving attempt more convincing.
Fake Pageverses have so many dangerous glitchy verses because of the same reason too, so anything that reaches this point gets corrupted to oblivion.
Fake Pagesverse types
[
]
As already said, Fake Pageverses have many types. Let's look at some of them, written below:
Normal
[
]
They are the ordinary Fake Pageverses, with their color scheme usually being cyan. You can view the content in a page, but only TOGs can edit them to change content. The latters can also do other things such as checking their history, move them, delete them, merge two or more of them and more.
The one in the middle of a
Fake Wikiverse
is, guess what? It's a‚Ä¶
Fake Main Pageverse
[
]
The largest one in all of its Fake Wiki, usually having a magenta color scheme. They usually tell us about what a Fake Wiki is about and its introduction, news, guidelines, records and more.
Fake Sub-pageverse
[
]
A Fake Pageverses sometimes have their Fake sub-pages, where editing is just normal. Their purpose is to tell us more content about their local Fake Pageverse.
Fake Templateverse
[
]
Fake Templateverses are just pages about template documentation. They are like normal ones but all the pages that have the specific template would be connected to right here. This is an example of how they are connected. All of them are originally made in source edit mode by TOGs.
Fake Categoryverse
[
]
These Fake Pageverses categorize pages in the same topic, quality, etc. For example, there is a Fake category for Verse pages (which means you will only find pages about Verses). So, it is also a great example of the connection with many other Fake Pageverses. However, not all pages in the same category pages are sorted and there are some that must not be in that category. So, TOGs edit by adding a category in that pageverse and if necessary, remove the category out of the page.
Others
[
]
There are many other Pageverses in the Fake Wikiverses, such as Fake Fileverses, Fake Talkverses, Fake Userpageverses, Fake Userblogverses and more. There even exists Fake Specialpageverses, which are already-existing pages in a Fake Wiki.
Glitches
[
]
Sometimes, a Fake Pageverse can get glitches when something goes wrong or defy how they work. This is because every Fake Pageverse are made up of verses that do this, like mentioned in the "Origins" section.
Most of them are very minor, which are usually caused by
NULLverses
; so minor that only a character of their coding is a bit unusual. The rarest of them all are the
FATALverses
where they can cause major glitch that are so bad that their local Fake Pages completely destroys themselves however though that is an extremely rare case.
Luckily, the more times a Fake Pageverse is visited by external
entities
, the less glitchier they are. Also, when a Fake Pageverse is glitchy but not because of the FATALverses, then that Fake Pageverse is considered to be "safe", though it only lasts for a mere amount of time. In fact, any ERRORverse can sometimes be stable, not only their FP.
Text appearance
[
]
Text for headings would just appear as the font chosen by a TOG who edited the theme of the Fake Wiki. The text generated in a FP (Fake Pageverse) is based by
2048 Tiles
and binary numeral system. Every character is what 2048 Tiles generate to. The tiles are also in binary system so a character is appeared by the number of bits needed to generate it. The less the familiar a symbol is, the more bits would be needed.
