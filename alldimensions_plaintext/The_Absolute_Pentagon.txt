The
Absolute Pentagon
contains 5 absolute squares, each 20

lengths apart.
The Corners
[
]
The corners of the absolute pentagon are sharper than any other verse smaller or bigger than it. If you were to put Absolutium even NEAR it, it would already completely be pierced by it despite not touching it. It can pierce objects so well, that it can pierce your hand from up to 2
Absolute Square
lengths away. This doesn't apply if you are inside of it, however. The strangest part of the corners is the top vertexes, which are 0.92% smaller than other vertexes. This is likely due to the fact that it's being crushed heavily back into the absolute pentagon. This likely means it will eventually become the absolute trapezoid in an
Absolute Eternity
, as it decreased by 0.01% of its size every 182 inaccessible eternities.
The Core
[
]
The core of this shape is where the ""top"" vertexes are being crushed into. It is unknown why it doesn't attract all other vertexes this way as well, but it's been theorized to be this way due to the shape being upright. The core is made out of giant versions of 4
Absolute Squares
.
Self Containing Properties
[
]
This is the first absolute shape that has self containing properties, but it does have a last shape. The last shape of it is containing of all variations of pentagons ever, as well as all squares, triangles, circles, etc. Any shape bigger than this is contained by this right after as well as the other absolute shapes to keep all of the scales the same.
