Entroverses are verses that are located near the "top" of a
Sequoiaverse
's tree, and are entered when the being that is climbing it perceives objects smaller than a Planck length as being larger than them. This is due to such a phenomenon not being physically possible.
The Entroverse, thus, has lots of physically impossible properties, its most notable being its dimensionality and entropy. Its entropy levels are higher than that that is physically possible, meaning that literally anything, possible or not, can happen. No Entroverse ever stays the same, even for a Planck time.
This causes them to actually be extremely dangerous, since you never know what is gonna come at you if you are inside of one. There have been multiple reports of people dying in gruesome and horrible ways inside of Entroverses, without any further warning.
Of course, it is also possible to enter ANOTHER verse through an Entroverse, in the event that entropy allows this to happen.
