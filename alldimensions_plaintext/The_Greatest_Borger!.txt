The
Greatest Borger
is a verse that is made of many "burgers" that have toppings, and those have interesting properties. Each burger has a structure similar to a
Great Borger
, although the actual composition of it and its toppings (
sagigesreV
) are different, as well as their properties. The Greatest Borger was meant to be named 'the greatest burgers', but it was misspelled when written and the name stuck.

Fliers from the agigesreV also sometimes fly through the gaps of the burgers.

Actual Burger Properties
[
]
The bun of each burger can be different based on the 3 classes of burgers in The Greatest Borger:
Normaclass: most similar in structure to the Great Borger
Anticlass: has a dark color and is bluish
Scalaclass: is grayscale and is the least interesting of all the classes
All burgers connect to each other, although one type will never connect to itself. The buns of each burger type are as follows:
Normaclass burgers have normal bread as their buns
Anticlass burgers have
gradientverses
compose their buns
Scalaclass burgers don't seem to have any bun, just a mist that is shaped like one
None of the burger 'meat' is actually meat, it is only composed of carbon, and scalaclass burgers don't even have any 'meat', just more toppings.
Topping Properties
[
]
Normaclass
[
]
The types of toppings considered toppings on a normaclass burger are as follows (top of burger to bottom):
THE seeds
(top bun)
Lettuce of Œ©
Ultra Onion
Terminal Tomatoes
Cheese (swiss)
(carbon layer)
More Lettuce of Œ©
(bottom bun)
These have their names due to branding, and were not decided on by any single person, or any people for that matter. All toppings are made of
agigesreV
and have special properties, although the effects only last for 1
OYC
. Here are some descriptions of the Normaclass burger ingredients:
Name
Description
THE seeds
These seeds look similar to sesame seeds, although they are the most normal of all the toppings. Consuming one has similar properties to the fruit of agigesreV when consumed, and it is also extremely hard. There are exactly 32 seeds on each burger.
Ultra Onion
This topping has absolutely no flavor at all, and is constructed from agigesreV in a torus structure. When consumed, every agigesreV inside adds 1 power to whatever cosmic entity ate it, unless they reach a power above a
Vsaue
, where it will be capped.
Terminal Tomatoes
A terminal object that is also made of agigesreV and allows for
œâ
{\displaystyle \omega}
times faster speed when consumed. Very rarely (around 0.1% of the time), it has the next omega and is increased by
Œ©
{\displaystyle \Omega}
times instead.
Cheese
It's just cheese. 90% of the time, it's specifically swiss cheese, but 9% of the time it is cheddar and 1% of the time there is no cheese.
Lettuce of Œ©
Appears twice on each burger. When consumed, both dimensionality increases by
Œ©
previous dimensionality
{\textstyle \Omega_{\text{previous dimensionality}}}
and size increases by
Œ©
previous size
{\textstyle \Omega_{\text{previous size}}}
for every agigesreV inside it
Anticlass
[
]
The types of toppings considered toppings on a anticlass burger are as follows (top of burger to bottom):
Antiseeds
(top bun)
Antilettuce Substance
Hyper Antionion
Tomato Terminal
Hyper Antionion (thinner layer)
(carbon layer)
More Antilettuce Substance
All effects last for 16 OYC.
Name
Description
Aiseeds
Antiseeds are like THE seeds, but are much darker and harder. Apparently, they taste like strawberries.
Antilettuce Substance
This is the anti-equivalent version of the Lettuce of Œ©. It has a gelatinous texture, and both dimensionality and size increase by
Œ©
Œ©
previous dimensionality or size
{\textstyle \Omega_{\Omega_\text{previous dimensionality or size}}}
. It is called a substance because it was originally thought to be composed of a new chemical, but now we know that it is made of agigesreV.
Hyper Antionion
This is the anti-equivalent of Ultra Onions. Apparently, it tastes like cheese. It is either found in thick strips or in thin layers, the larger of which increasing your
Existence Rank
by
œâ
{\displaystyle \omega}
, and the smaller increasing it by 1.
Tomato Terminal
The anti-equivalent of Terminal Tomatoes. It is made of
Gradientverses
and also agigesreV, and currently has zero known effects.
Scalaclass
[
]
As previously mentioned, scalaclass burgers are uninteresting. So uninteresting, in fact, that is only has one type of topping, the gray topping. It has no interesting properties whatsoever, and is just gray. It also has no taste and no known effects.
