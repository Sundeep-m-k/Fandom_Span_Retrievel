An image of the @everyone ping
The @everyone/@everyone Ping is an event which happens extremely rarely. When the @everyone Ping occurs, very large parts of the cosmology will be "shaken" and everything's
Blueprint Particles
will begin to wobble and become loose, ripping apart countless things from the inside. This can kill gods even as powerful as
Alphasm
, and can heavily damage entities such as
Bean Man
or even
Zaloƒ
.
As of now, @everyone Ping has only occured 3 times and the entities behind it have outlawed it. Statistics of the @everyone Pings are listed below.

Origin of the @everyone Ping
[
]
The origins of the @everyone are still unknown, and it does not seem to be from the AD cosmology. One theory is that the @everyone Pings occurred because of
Transcendent Omni-Gods
. This is most likely true.
Other Variations of the @everyone Ping
[
]
There are many other variations of the @everyone Ping, although they are much less destructive.
Weaker Versions of @everyone Pings
[
]
There are countless weaker versions of @everyone Pings. One example is the @Pencil Ping, which is significantly weaker. It only causes minimal damage to things inside of Alphasm and is much more common. There are many other such Pings, such as the @keuradeurva Ping, the @Scoot Ping, and the @MinersHavenM43 Ping... all of which do something slightly different.
One of these examples is the @BestNoobReborn ping, which is the weakest kind. It only mentally harms BestNoobReborn, and it has been used to the point that it's completely desolate, as BestNoobReborn has become dead inside from the use of the ping.
Fake @everyone Pings
[
]
A large amount of fake @everyone pings have occurred. These so-called @everyone pings, even though they appear to look like an @everyone Ping, are actually not, and do as much damage as a weaker version of an @everyone Ping.
@here Ping
[
]
The @here Ping is just like the @everyone Ping, although it effects AD cosmology that is currently awake (if alive) and doesn’t affect low-activity verses, and is slightly weaker.
