The beauty contains beauty. Trying to find how much it has is dumb, because beauty is not truly objective. In this verse is a soup of art music and things mixing together to form new things. The soup is always stewing and will continue to stir. It will always be in balance between total chaos and order, because beauty lies not in extremes, but in between. The stirring is made up of particles which are pre arts-particles, or artons, which collided to make something new. If two artons collided, their internal particles combine in a specific way to form art, music, architecture, etc. The combination of particles with artons are the genes of each art piece which they themselves give trillions of particles to be collided, and the process starts again. It is inside the third everything layer.

Well, the substance (if you don't know, to give an analogy: the soup mixed in soup before any solid food was put there) was stirring and stirring until one particle and another collided to form an art piece. Particles started to collide with each other over and over again until two particle formed the first music. The soup was becoming more variant, like adding potatoes and carrots to a soup make a more variant soup. New genres of art were created in this soup like film, animations, architectures, etc. Then, art of the verse invented and the first verse to be invented was
