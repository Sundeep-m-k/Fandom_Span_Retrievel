The mirror chain is a beyond unlimited chain of verses that parallels every other verse including itself.For example if you took the
Allsphere
and saw its first mirror verse, only small details of its existence are changed but with every refraction a detail changes so on the 100th refraction if a verse is intact in the original version,it may be corrupted,distorted or wiped from existence in in its canonical area.This even applies for larger verses like
Nihilum
.So What if cosmic entities are included?Well they are as they follow the same rules as the verses do.The time,motion,rules of physics,quantum mechanics,and reality may also be subject to change depending on the direction of reflection.This verses boundaries are ruled by
Sudin
himself.This is also where
G O D
fought Sudin and lost even after using  Ultimate Erasure on Im and where he fought Meowus and won yet again. The concept of reality is transcended by this verse as it alters it.The mirror chain itself is a semi sentient entity and can alter itself to some extent however,it also cannot directly control, recreate or erase a verse it only can manipulate the events to do so.This verse has been destroyed and recreated once by Sudin its ruler.Every verse has its own mirror no matter its size.This also applies to wiki terminator verses including
The Impercievable Plane
and any void including
The EndSphere
and
In-Between
