Nonacubeverse is the Nona (9) of the cube series, Nested functions don’t work here because we entered the complex functions, it’s too complex,
Nonacubeverse
If you imagine an infinite picture, you will ask how the outside of the infinite picture look like? Imagine a green square than it is infinite then the full image of the square is just a green screen because it have infinite surface

. WAIT WAIT WAIT, it’s not the end here, there is also Decacubeverse, Nonacubeverse have a mysterious effect makes you believe it’s the final cubeverse, but it’s not, it also can hypnotize you.
Example of the containment from now
[
]
From this point, from now, the cubeverse will contain infinite cubeverses
Story
[
]
It is unknown how it formed a tunnel of Octacubeverses but here is one: Some Nonacubeverses was rogue until they have a bunch of them in a point which makes the other Octacubeverses get attracted to it due to the gravity, the Octacubeverses formed slowly into a Nonacubeverse.
Temperature

The Temperature this verse is even hotter it have the temperature of the
Prelidium
