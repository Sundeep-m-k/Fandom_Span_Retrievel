Imaginary Octahedron
is a
nonexistent
octahedron that can be found in
Multiverse
, which makes a kind of
Imaginary Polyhedrons
.
It is the rarest regular kind of Imaginary Polyhedrons, as it can be naturally created by
Imaginary Energy
,
Cosmic Cloud
, and nothing else. Most Imaginary Octahedrons are originated in
Imaginary Icosahedrons
.
How it works?
[
]
Imaginary Energy
normally loops around Imaginary Octahedron, until a nearest Imaginary Octahedron has been found in a 1 trillion light year radius. It makes Imaginary Energy a fiber for interuniversal intrastructure between
Universes
and
Imaginary Cubes
.
Therefore, it serves as a network point of
Imaginary Cubes
, for data storage, law conservation of
Imaginary Energy
, and alloying
Interuniversal metals
.
Imaginary Octahedrons can be putted in large Imaginary Cubes, which it can be served as divisors of Imaginary Cubes, and to form a more efficient network. This kind of Imaginary Cubes are often used for storing data.
Imaginary Octahedrons can also turn
Universes
into Parallel Universes, by really dense Imaginary Energies and big Imaginary Cubes, if one Imaginary Octahedron is placed beneath the pole of an Universe.
