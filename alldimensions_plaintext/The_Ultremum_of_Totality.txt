The Ultremum of Totality
The Ultremum of Totality is the third of the three
Hypremums
. These three verses are similar to the
Supremums
. This verse, however, instead of relying on axioms or even proofs, this verse relies on facts. This verse is the combined total of the previous two
Hypremums
, and far more. It covers all that can be comprehended, all that can be described, all that is unknown, all that is unfathomable, all that is beyond that, and far more.
The Ultremum of Totality's size and dimensionality is measured via the use of the
T
n
{\displaystyle \mathcal{T_n}}
(Totality) Function, the function that governs the totality of something. It also uses the constant of totality,
τ
{\displaystyle \mathcal{\tau}}
. This verse embodies all of totality due to the fusion of the Totality Function (
T
n
{\displaystyle \mathcal{T_n}}
), and the Constant of Totality (
τ
{\displaystyle \mathcal{\tau}}
) to make make the number
T
τ
{\displaystyle \mathcal{T_\tau}}
.
A story in the
Tales of Infinity
appears to be related to this being, which will be put on this page.
The Totality of the World
[
]
In the beginning, there was a being who was lonely. He wanted to make a world that was vast and great that his creations could admire, so he made it. He made vast skies full of beings who would rule the world below it. He made an
Ocean
filled with fierce predators that many would fear. He made a great
Landmass
with beings that would live in harmony together. One day, the
Ocean
wanted itself to be bigger, so it asked its creator to give it to him. The creator said that it would disrupt his worlds balance. The
Ocean
decided to take it by force, so he invaded the
Land
, killing many beings and taking most of it. Those who were killed became lost forever and forgotten. Now all that remains of the
Land
is an infinitesimal speck, a shadow of its former glory.
