Scott
, also known as

(full name.) And known as The First Speedster and The First Ever Bacon Hair. ScottRussell744 is an unfathomably powerful and fast
entity

ScottRussell744 used to be a normal but lonely being until a mysterious object struck near his hometown called
Robloxia.
Curious, Scott wanted to investigate what the noise was. Once he arrived at the crash site, the object was pulsing with a mysterious bluish-black energy. Scott walked up to the object and touched it out of pure curiosity. When Scott touched the object, an unbelievable amount of energy and power surged through the object and went through to Scott, giving him an unfathomable amount of power and energy. This gives Scott the courage to train himself, all by himself.
ScottRussell744 trained himself in several martial arts, like Muay Thai, Karate, Boxing, Kickboxing, Jujitsu, Brazilian Jujitsu and Krav Maga. Scott train his body nonstop for hours on end and pushed himself to limit every training session he did. Thus making him a master martial artist in a few years.

Quotes I made up
[
]
All of these quotes are made up.
"Good internet? Don't make me laugh. Getting good internet is a weakness."
To be honest. I think this quote was pretty cool.
Scrapped version of the now quote I used. üòÄüëç
"Good Internet? That's a weakness."
The only thing that i changed is the "That's a weakness." Part to the now "Getting good internet is a weakness."
"As long as I'm lagging, I can beat you, no matter what you do."
This is the quote i honestly like the most.
And last but not least is the "As The First Speedster, i only i'm the fastest." 
This quote is inspired by the lines Gojo said in Season 2, Episode 3, "Hidden Inventory 4" of Jujutsu Kaisen.
