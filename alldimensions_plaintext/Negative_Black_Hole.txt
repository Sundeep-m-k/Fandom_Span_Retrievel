A Negative Black Hole.
Introduction
[
]
Negative black holes
, also known as
anti-black holes
are
black holes
that are made up entirely of
antimatter
, hence their name.
Properties
[
]
They function the same way as their ordinary counterparts made out of
matter
, except they can also be used to fix broken
multiverses
.
They also can serve as food for bellanoids, which are made out of
xenum
.
They are one of the only objects that can counteract
toxicium
, as the latter gets destroyed by the antimatter that negative black holes are made of. They are also effective against compounds that are made out of toxicium like
toxicuandaic slurry
.
Location
[
]
Negative black holes can only be found wandering inside of
gigaverses
.
