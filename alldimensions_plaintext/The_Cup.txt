The Cup
is a "Defensive structure" containing
Ice Creams
. They're made of Glassium which is a glass-looking material, but a lot harder to destroy than the former and with some strange yet irrelevant properties, and their purpose is to protect the Ice Creams.
All attempts to go through the Cups and destroy their local Ice Creams have failed, due to part of their composition being a ""void"" capable to suck and disintegrate the dangers outside them, while letting autorized creatures pass. But, there is a weak point of this defense: The upper part. If you enter by that area, you could reach their local Ice Creams and do whatever you want with them. Well, if in the first place you can resist the unsafeness of the Ice Creams themselves.
Cups also have shiny orange colors that attract unaware creatures to their doom. Thats because the entities living in the Ice Creams sometimes are evil, and want to see lesser creatures being destroyed. MFs are devious ðŸ’€
