(Tiny)
(or
[Tiny]
) is a ludicrously small particle that are, as the name suggests, very tiny, but that much compared to the
Unedions
, their container, as they're only 0.1% of it's size. However, In that 0.1%, there is some of the most broken, glitchy, and unstable stuff anyone inside of either the Unedions or
-s
.
In fact, [Tinies] are so unstable and broken, that the image on the right is the most stable image we've found of them, since [Tinies]' looks change a ridiculous amount of times in very short spans of time.
(Tinies)'
existence rank
also change by literal orders of magnitude, positive and negative, almost as fast as their look changes. Their unstability is also off the charts, even at this ridiculously tiny scale. If they explode, they do it via a shockwave that is around the size of a
Portal
.
Only one [Tiny] can exist at a time in an Unedion, but they replace themselves almost 1000000000x times as fast as they collapse.
A (Tiny) Universe?
[
]
Many rumours have been speculated that somewhere out there, there's an
Universe
the size of the
Observable Universe
, that is exclusively made up of this type of particle. The rumor's source is unknown, but the experiment has been proven as impossible countless times as getting Raw [Tinies] is basically impossible because it would be too unstable to exist.
|Tiny|
[
]
|Tinies| are a variant of [Tinies] that are much smaller than them, while also being many times more unstable. A |Tiny| will appear randomly instead of a normal one in an Unedion when the previous one has collapsed. The shockwave caused by their explosion can destroy
Balls
, structures above Portals which means they're even more dangerous than the more common counterparts.
Overall
[
]
(Tinies) are extremely broken and unstable things that exist (just like the previous particles) and are very strange in it's material.
