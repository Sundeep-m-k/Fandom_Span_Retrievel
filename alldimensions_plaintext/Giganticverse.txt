Giganticverses
are
verses
which have 649 layers in their mini hierarchy, each one being (Previous Giganticverse's size in LY ^ 10) LY times bigger than the previous one.
The biggest one of our local Giganticverse is called Gigantas-650-332 and its extremly big (duh). The smallest one, which starts our mini-hierarchy is called Minigigas-1-203.
