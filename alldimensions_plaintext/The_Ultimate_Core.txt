The Ultimate Core
is a core with all of it's ultimate things. These cores contains entirely of
Megacores' fractals
into a white large structure. The color white only appears as every megacore have a different colored fractal to others and those colors are to mix, so it appears white. Ultimate cores are so powerful that it seems like energy is not the only thing (it is too small for this verse to be working), higher leveled energy called Metaenergy would be required. Metaenergy is beyond what energy can be used at most, Metaenergy is
impossible
to create (only formed with enough energy concentrated within a finite area) or destroy but can be used for everything else. That's it, it is the ultimate core with ultimate energy to keep operating.
