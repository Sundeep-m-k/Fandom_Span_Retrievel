To die
Killmeman is an immortal cosmic entity that hates his life and ultimately wants to end it. He ignores any advice from other entities to not kill himself, and has tried lots of ways to die, such as stabbing himself with a random tetrahedron, jumping in a volcano, and many more.
He is immortal to any being unless Primordial Gods and stronger, and can survive even a kilogram of
Primordium Chaos
. He WILL go for any dangers he finds, and has immeasurable depression. He cannot be cheered up, and has even tried to manipulate other gods to attack him.
He looks like a white Minecraft body with lots of chars, wounds, etc. There is also a tetrahedron stuck in his head from when he tried to die with it. He also has a constantly sad face.

He did try to mind-control
Chunky Cheese
to attack him, but Chunky Cheese was too strong for that.
