Infinitesimal
does not refer to
a quantity less than any finite quantity yet not zero,
but rather an extremely small particle contained inside
Microests
. This type of particle is so unstable that it somehow loops back to being stable. In fact, they're so stable that they're most likely the most stable things in existence, making it impossible for even some gods to destroy it. Their durability is around the one a
Betasm
has.
Using a new and special kind of microscope using the explosion energy from Microests, scientists were able to view these particles, though only 2 images exist of them, 1 is available to the public, and the other one is in a vault made with an indestructible material with a 50 number combination and with a smaller 20 number combination inside it, and is floating somewhere outside of our
Box
. People who somehow manage to open the two vaults will be warned by security and will get arrested before if not get a heart attack being able to upload the image. Recently, a group of 6 entities were arrested for showing the vaulted picture of an Infinitesimal to the public by Nobezian police.

Infinitesimals are far too small to contain any entities. If an entity were to be shrunken down to fit inside them, they'd disappear for an unknown reason.
