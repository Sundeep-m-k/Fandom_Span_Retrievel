and countless other verses trapped in a time loop
The
Vicious Cycle
is a huge verse that constantly cycles and warps itself along all time dimensions with all of its contents, causing all verses inside of it (not counting nested verses) to be in a time loop (
Bezkonceverse
, etc.). Due to The Vicious Cycle constantly warping itself along all time dimensions, it is extremely hard to escape due to it being easy for you to just loop back in time, causing an infinite loop of you doing the same thing again and again for the rest of eternity.
Even though breaking the time loop in a verse inside The Vicious Cycle is extremely hard, it has been successfully done before, one example being the
Bezkonceverse
. Multiple of every time-looped verse exist, with slight differences like someone having cereal instead of toast. The increase in available time loops this way helped The Vicious Cycle grow.
Between each verse in The Vicious Cycle lies a void of gigantic proportions. These voids are extremely dangerous due to the time loop, and hostile entities reside in these voids as well. These entities do not exist in time, thus completely ignoring the time loop. The entities have consumed the verses inside The Vicious Cycle, as they are the entities' only source of food.
