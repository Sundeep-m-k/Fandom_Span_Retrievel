Structure
[
]
The Astral Projection is composed of a bright cube with pillars that keep the verse structurally stable. A rotated square (45 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise) can be seen on one side of the cube within the inside, glowing and providing light to the many Petultimateverses that are within The Astral Projection (87SxDe Petultimateverses to be exact).
Life
[
]
Life within The Astral Projection can be found in 5 sectors: Diamond, Starlight, Ion, Uranium, and Bismuth. Each have their own quirks and are in a mini-hierarchy that sort the five sectors nicely with one another.
Diamond
[
]
Diamond citizens are at the lowest level and primarily focus on keeping Petultimateverses in check, including interaction with life Petultimateverses provide.
Starlight
[
]
Starlight citizens are at the second level of the hierarchy and lean towards keeping The Astral Projection clean and shiny (as a result of Bismuth citizens being present).
Ion
[
]
Ion citizens are at the middleline of the hierarchy and they provide resources, buildings, and structures (that aren't like The Astral Projection's structures that keep it stable) to supply all citizens with essentials & other stuff.
Uranium
[
]
Uranium citizens are at the penultimate level of the hierarchy and they basically keep The Astral Projection in check in-case any errors, conflicts, or violations of life within The Astral Projection happen (in other words, they are like law enforcement, but more).
Bismuth
[
]
Bismuth citizens are at the top of the hierarchy and they govern The Astral Projection in its entirety, from changes to the structure of The Astral Projection, to changes that affect daily life within The Astral Projection. They are the most important citizens (inspite of their low population, being the lowest of the five), so they are heavily guarded by Uranium citizens whenever they go out in public. Any death of a Bismuth citizen by violence of any sort will usually lead to the perpetrator facing death.
General
[
]
In general, these citizens live the life we do, but such things in their life may be affected by the presence of the Petultimateverses (and their life). Overall, they have as much power as a kardashev type 5 civilization.
The Fountain of Trust
[
]
This is a structure that grants the creation of unlimited Diamond citizens, albeit with requiring a Bismuth citizen approval. It will create 800 Diamond citizens without cost, and those citizens will have an age determined by the Bismuth citizen.
The Bismuth RNG Center
[
]
This is another structure, this time focusing on some aspects of gambling. However, it has the heavy price of converting 50 Bismuth citizens to one, usually random thing. However, there's a 1/4 chance a Bismuth citizen will come out as a result. For obvious reasons, this will only be used upon the Bismuth citizens being overpopulated (max of 1,000 Bismuth citizens).
Trivia
[
]
The image of this verse is a reference to a Roblox game called Button Simulator: Excavation Discoveries.
The realm that is shown in the image is Smooth Depths, but 2D, as the realm in-game is 3D.
The citizens of The Astral Projection are references to the stats that can be found in the Smooth Depths, in progression order.
The two mentioned structures are references to a recovery button & the Bismuth Geode Button that can be found in the Smooth Depths.
