{\displaystyle [\aleph_{Orange Ring}, \aleph_{Orange Ring}, \aleph_{100}]}
The Purple Rings are usually ranked as "Purple" on the
Kardeshav scale
, although 2.6% of the time (3.9% in the outer sections), they rank as "Violet" due to their instability.
Harness of Purple Rings
[
]
Despite the fact that the Purple Rings appear to be made out of lightning, do not attempt to harness them, as if you do that all of your personal possessions will suddenly catch on fire that will be impossible to put out.
The reason why this happens is because if you harness one of them, it'll ACTUALLY turn into lightning, causing your possessions to set on fire, as one scientist did in an attempt to find a better source of energy for his local Purple Ring.
If the harnessing attempt is too powerful, this phenomenom could even affect their whole Purple Ring and bring it down. The image found within the infobox shows a visual example of this.
Taste and smell
[
]
The Purple Rings usually have the taste of grapes and the smell of purple paintbrushes. However, on 1.3% (1.95% in the outer sections) of tastes/sniffs, the Purple Rings will instead taste of eggplants and smell of violet paintbrushes, due to its instability.
Stability
[
]
The Purple Rings are the 3rd unstable types of Rings, even more so than the
Yellow
and Orange ones.
Ejection
[
]
Approximately every 1157.05 days, 10 to 25 Orange Rings are ejected from the Purple Rings due to their instability, but because to the size difference between the Purple and Orange Rings, this is still a somewhat trivial problem.
The outer edges of the Purple Rings (which are the actual "ring") are even more unstable, with 15 to 37 rings being ejected every 250.025 days.
Purple Ring Organization
[
]
Our local one is under the control of the Purple Ring Organization, and its leader acts as a
divine
guardian for the
verse
. It, which is usually found at its center, was once attacked by the 5 Guardians of the previous Ring. The battle nearly resulted in the slaying of the Purple,
Green
, and
Blue
Guardians. The attack was unsuccessful though, due in part to the Purple Ring Organization assisting in defending their Guardian.
Guardian's pleasing
[
]
If the protector of the Purple Ring is pleased, the amount of Rings ejected will decrease by 2 to 3 (3 to 5 in the outer sections), and the frequency will be increased to 750.75 days per ejection (375.0375 days in the outer section), indicating its power over its Ring. Nothing seems to happen when the Guardian is displeased though, and those figures will remain as they are when the Guardian is feeling neutral. Due to this, while it is still a minimal issue, the Purple Ring Organization generally tries to keep the guardian of the Purple Ring happy.
