Abillities (cuz I apparently need to show proof that sarpy is the strongest):
[
]
Ultimate Creation: can create entire sets of
hypercosmologies
Haxoversal Barriers: basically sarpy can seal a entity into a interactable Tesseract shaped box which is just a miniature
Haxo
verse
Hyper Rewriting: can basically rewrite any
entity
into anything he wants, he doesn't even have to imagine
Number Creation: creation of new numbers
Plot Manipulation: basically can control the literal plot
Auctoriokinesis: maximum manipulation of the chances of winning or losing, basically luck
Power System Change: Changes power systems
Ultimate Destruction: a move of Destruction so powerful and beyond everything that it makes the
primordials blueprint particle thingys
look QEUTTASCOPIC
Matter Manipulation: self explanatory
Offset and position manipulation: basically omnipresence on
sarpy particle
Concept Manipulation: Controls all concepts like everything and anything and whatever at all
Praeterimmortality: beyond untouchable, basically think of the Roblox forcefields when u spawn but epic
Self Rating: sarpy can rate himself, that means
the rules of carl the redeemer doesn't apply
.
Automatic countering:  counters any attack even the types of attack that dont exist
Hyper immunity: unlike normal immunity, it is straight up impossible to pierce this one
Buff changer: can remove any buff a entity places on themsleves if the entity keeps trying to buff itself even if it's removed then the entity will permanently turn into a
inanimate object
or just nothingness
Power Return: if a entity steals sarpy's powers then the powers would kill the entity because sarpy's powers are so powerful that you would literally DIE if you stole them
Respawnality Manipulation: manipulates the chances for anything to respawn
Beyondaility: Beyond the transcendence of the ascending transcending ascension of any conceptiuallizon or whatever and prefixes
Nuh Uh: the most powerful counter ever
Super-Nuh Uh: counters your anti counter
Real life existence: much like jerald who actually exists, sarpy exists too in real life and guess what person sarpy is?? It's ME1!1!!1!11!!1!1!!1!1
Î© Wall breaker: self explanatory
Cloning: sarpy can clone himself(the clones are like equally strong and smart as him) and he can make the clones transform to Energy and return to him(the clones know they're clones and they're chill and they don't mind it)
Ultra instinct Hypereme: this is a form of mastered ultra instinct which uses also THE POWER OF MEMES AND THE CHAOS EMERALDS
MASSIVE NEWS: THOTDAL IS
REVAMPED
NOW
[
]
Does he have Lore?:
[
]
uhh yes he does, in 0 BOYC(Boxerial Year Calender which is a Calender before the omniversal one) he just popped up and begin creating stuff,
important thing to note That Sarpy Does NOT have a body the image in this page is what he shows himself as
once he was done creating lots of stuff like the lords I guess, he took like a morbillion year nap cuz he's tired, and in 26 OYC
TUI
tried to rebel which is the most stupidest thing ever to do, like rebelling against the all dimensions equivalent of GOD is dumb, anyways once sarpy just sealed TUI in a mini Haxoverse he took yet another morbillion year nap(bruh) and in 2763 OYC he made more stuff I guess, and in 12,000,000 OYC he made the glober because he was extremely bored and in whatever OYC he saw
TFLOM'S
First creation(other than the void)
The Lord of GAMBLING1!1!1!1!1
this was the funniest thing sarpy saw in hypereons and uhhhhhhhhhhh I'll add more in the future and important thing to note that
[GOD]
's mention of SARPY IS NOT EVEN HIM because sarpy being a mars human whatever thing completely contradicts the entire
Sarpacominom(where all lore of sarpy and his creations and anything about me/sarpy)
