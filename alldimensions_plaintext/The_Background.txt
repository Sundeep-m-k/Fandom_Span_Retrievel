The Background
[
]
The area or scenery behind the main object of contemplation, especially when perceived as a framework for it. The circumstances or situation prevailing at a particular time or underlying a particular event. A backstory, background story, back-story, or background is a set of events invented for a plot, presented as preceding and leading up to that plot. It is a literary device of a narrative history all chronologically earlier than the narrative of primary interest. Background information typically describes the history of the topic or the cause of the problem, to the topic addresses. It can also establish the topic's importance or show how to solve a problem. Background information is usually three to five sentences, and comes after the writer gets the reader's attention. Background information is any information that would be necessary for the reader to understand the topic of the essay. This information is usually placed in the introduction, after the hook. Background knowledge allows us to make inferences and fill in the gaps between what is stated and unstated in a piece of writing. This means it contains everything, and everything in real life. It is 'infinite' to where its impossible for anything to reach an 'infinite' amount of backgrounds, to another. The 4 types of knowledge with examples are:
Factual Knowledge.
Conceptual Knowledge.
Procedural Knowledge.
Metacognitive Knowledge.
The Background has all of those knowledge put in together. The Background is also the part of a scene or picture that is farthest from the viewer. the part of a scene that is behind a main figure or object in a painting, photograph, and literally everything. The law of the background is literally having sense. Sense would not even exist, without the background. The Background is a thing full of events, and logical sense. It contains everything in the fandom, fiction, and 'reality'. The spot of the eye cant see the factor of the background. It is only viewed on anywhere, and anytime. It has the meaning of how a narrative works.
'A spoken or written account of connected events.' 'in the form of or concerned with narration.' 'A narrative, story, or tale is any account of a series of related events or experiences, whether nonfictional or fictional. Narratives can be presented through a sequence of written or spoken words, through still or moving images, or through any combination of these'.
