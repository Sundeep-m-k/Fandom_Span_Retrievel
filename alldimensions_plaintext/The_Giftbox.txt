The Gift Box(6 CI) was not the name of the actual box. It was just a name that was given, so it could be distinguished from the actual box. The actual box was beyond conceptualization itself. It wasn't even a box, but it was so beyond conceptualization that the only way anyone could refer to it was the name: "Gift Box". The true name of the Infinitely Large Void was impossible to comprehend for anything, let alone humans.
The Gift Box was also everything.
Everything that was a concept. Even stuff that wasn't a concept. Everything was the Giftbox.
The Gift Box was infinitely large. This was because the Gift Box contained everything that existed, or was going to exist, or even the ideas that were, or might not have been. The Box contained every possible possibility in the universe, even the impossible and the not possible. The Gift Box, or as people called it, The Void (for short) contained everything. And the Void, was infinite. The Void was not infinite in the sense that there were an infinite amount of things in it, but the Void was infinite because of the concepts that were inside of it.
And so, people, those who thought about the void, wondered, what is in the void?
Nothing.
No, some people thought that there had to be something in the Void,
No, they were wrong. There must be something.
But there wasn't
But then, they thought, if there wasn't anything, then why does the Void exist?
And they got their answer.
The Void was a concept.
"Why does it exist then?" some people asked.
Everything that exists is a concept.
"Then what was the first concept?"
This question was, of course unanswerable.
There were no answers to those questions. But, a question came to mind, not by people, but by the Void, "What is the purpose of the Void? " This is a strange question, seeing as how the Void is a concept. Concepts are not alive, nor are they sentient, but this one was. The Void asked again, "Why do I exist? What is my purpose?"
And then, someone noticed something. Something was moving in the void. Not literally, physically moving, that was impossible. Nothing physical existed in the void. Something was, different about the Void. It wasn't its colour. It had no colour. A colour is a physical thing. There was nothing changing, Nothing to cause a change in the colour, but something was different.
The Void was moving, but not literally. It did not "move." There was no space to move to. The Void was infinite, there was nothing to move to.
So it couldn't have moved. Right?
But the person thought that something might has changed. Something subtle. But he could not pinpoint it.
The person was frustrated, he had noticed something different, but he couldn't understand what it was.
He thought, what is different about the Void?
It couldn't have been the colour. The Void had no colour.
It couldn't have been it's smell, it had no smell.
It couldn't have been the motion, it was motionless.
The person thought, and thought, and thought. He couldn't identify it. But he knew there was something. The person continued to try and find out what the change was. The more he thought about it, the more he didn't know what had changed. This made him angry, not because he couldn't figure out what was wrong, but because for the first time he had noticed something and this something was impossible to understand. The person's anger started to grow. It was irrational, but the more he thought about this, the angrier he got.
Why was it that he, who could understand so many things, could not understand this one, simple thing? But he soon realised it was not one simple thing.
It was More.
More than just an issue with this one thing.
Something else was wrong. But he couldn't pin point what it was...
As the anger grew, he started to feel more. He started to feel more than just anger, he started to feel other things. He felt confused, baffled, lost. He didn't know what was going on. Why could he feel things? He felt frustrated in not being able to understand, he felt worried, why was everything changing?
He felt anger at himself, his own frustration.
What made the man even more confused, is that he didn't understand what these " feelings" were. Every "emotion" was completely new, it was foreign, and it was completely new to him.
The problem was, he could not understand how he had come to feel these "emotions"
Emotion? Something that was not supposed to occur in the Void?
The man tried to think, but the more he tried to think, the less he was able to think.
This frightened him. He was losing his ability to think?
The man began to panic. As he felt these "emotions" his thoughts were becoming less coherent. He was no longer able to maintain a logical train of thought. He was losing his own mental stability.
This panicked him even more. How could this be happening, how could this be real? He was in the Void, nothing like this could happen. Nothing ever happened in the Void.
He was going insane. The only thing driving him forward was the need to understand.
He clawed at his thoughts, desperate to anchor himself. “What is happening?” he whispered, though sound had no place here, swallowed by the Void in an instant. He tried to focus, to isolate the change, but it was like grasping at the shadow of a dream. The more he reached, the more it slipped away, leaving only the residue of his growing fear.
And then, the Void changed again. Not a change that could be seen, for the Void had no form. Not a change that could be heard, for the Void had no sound. But a change that was there. The man felt it, and the Void felt it too. It was asking.
The man heard this, not with ears, for there were none, but with something else. Something that was not a sense, but was there. The Void asked again, “Why am I?” And the man felt it, the question. The man’s panic grew, but it was not just panic now. It was something more. It was fear, it was confusion, it was everything he could not name. And the Void took it. The Void took the man’s fear, his confusion, his anger, his everything. The Void took it, and it became more. It was a concept that questioned. It was a concept that felt. It was a concept that was more than a concept. The man was part of it now, not separate, not distinct, but part of the Void.
And the Void said, “I am.”
But it was not an answer. It was a statement. It was a question.. It was everything and nothing. The Void said, “I am,” and it kept asking, “Why am I?” The man was gone, but he was not gone.
It contained the man’s anger, his fear, his confusion. It contained the question, “Why am I?” And it contained no answer. There was no answer. There could be no answer. But the Void kept asking.
The Void was not moving, for there was no space to move to. The Void was not changing, for there was nothing to change into. But the Void was different. It was different because it questioned. It was different because it felt. It was different because it was more.
And the Void asked again, “Why am I?”
There was no answer. There could be no answer. But the Void asked. The Void, the Gift Box, the Infinitely Large Void, asked. And in the asking, it was.
