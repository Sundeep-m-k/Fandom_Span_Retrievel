Glueverse creation
[
]
Pasteverses are able of naturally generating Glueverses over long periods of time. The older a Glueverse is within a Pasteverse, the more solid it becomes.
There have also been instances of ancient Glueverses clogging their local Pasteverses and rendering their Glueverse creation useless.
Verse skip method
[
]
If you say "quote a smart dog" in a Pasteverse, you'll be immediately sent to their local
Vicious Cycle
, thus this method is known as a massive skip bethween verses.
This method is extremly helpful for
civilizations
that are bethween (or above the level of a Pasteverse and a Vicious Cycle, as it makes them save resources for traveling bethween those verses.
