"TPH" redirects here. For the hierarchy with same abbreviation. see
The Post-Hierarchy
.
This hierarchy is made for the tiniest things. It starts from just below our
Universe
and ends at the tiniest objects on the entire wiki, passing through planets, countries, humans, atoms, elementary particles, etc.
The Hierarchy Ranking of this hierarchy ranks at
(H
-1
)
.
NOTICE:
This hierarchy is in reverse order compared to
the Official Hierarchy
and its continuations; in other words, objects contain the next object on the hierarchy, so objects get smaller as the page progresses.
SECOND NOTICE:
the hierarchy is not linear; it branches off into different paths.

Diagram of Class 0 to show the relationships between objects.
Class 0 has multiple objects that we can see and easily understand the size of, as well as much smaller objects that contain negative and imaginary sizes.

Once we get to the Null Class, the concept of size begins to break down. Eventually even the number of properties particles have reach 0 and even negative levels and also has a negative size. The concept of negative size will be started from

"Abstract dimensions, a strange blend of mathematics and objects. Particles embodying mathematical concepts--are a common sight here."
The above quote is a good explanation for how the axiomatic class begins, due to the fusion of mathematics with particles. Manifestations of abstract objects can be found here, and objects themselves become abstract as you go smaller and smaller.
A simplified explanation can be found

These... objects are below concepts but are still concepts... but the idea that they are below concepts overrides the fact that they are concepts, so they defy logic. They are also well below particles that can follow logic, since they are somehow smaller than logic itself. Very weird. They are also some of the first we we have discovered to be less than Nothing. Which we thought was impossible until an extremely light-sensitive device somehow managed to see them. Despite them being literally less than nothing.

They are beyond logic and nonexist or even nullexist as much as possible. We can say that there are none. Their size is simply indescribable.
