Introduction
[
]
Omnigiants
(aka class ω Stars) are the largest known spectral type of a
star
, surpassing any type of main sequence stars we know. They are so big, that their diameter ranges from 2,000 ~ 2,000,000,000,000 light years across. They are also so massive that their masses range from 8×10
35
~ 3.6×10
55
solar masses, which might sounds like as if the defy physics in
universes
. They fuse many
hyperradioactive elements
throughout their lifetime and the most common ones we can extract from them is Celestite (225,049
th
element), Maxxium (299,976
th
), Veneasite (391,642
nd
) and many more, the most massive element they can actually is Hypernium being the 708,464 element
[

]
. They are also super dense due to high gravitional forces were bounding hyperradioactive elements, making them extremely massive. So they produce a whole new type of matter, called
neutral matter
(whole new type of particles and even atoms). They live for quintillions to septillions of years, too. Despite their massiveness, they are so rare and (also so far) that only, and so far, only 5 of them has been discovered. So, they are also the rarest normal stars ever.

There are a few types of omnigiants depending on their properties. These stars are divided into 4 groups, from ω
-1
to ω
2
.
All the Omnigiants' colors are almost the same, so the only way to distinguish that object to be in one of the spectral type categories is the properties that they must have.
The color of these stars is light purple or magenta but very hard to distinguish due to high illuminance.
ω
-1
[
]
These stars are the smallest omnigiants. Their radii ranges from 500 ~ 50,000 ly. Their color is light purple, which maybe confusing with the Q

'.
ω
0
[

They are the second smallest spectral type of omnigiants. The radii of these stars ranges from 50,000 ~ 50,000,00 ly. Color is just like ω
-1
stars, but lighter purple.
ω
1
[
]
The stars in this spectral type are larger. Their sizes are comparable with the
galactic superclusters
. Color is now distinguishable, because all of these stars are very light magenta. They are the most common ones, too.
ω
2
[
]
This is the largest spectral type of Omnigiants. Some of these stars are as big as some
Universes
. They are almost white in color (a little bit of rose).

List of Omnigiants
[
]
This is a list of all the known omnigiants. Because these stars are so rare, and are so far away that they appear to be very dim despite their high luminosities.
The list is listed as how far each star is.

Formation
[
]
Omnigiants are formed when there's a lot of leftover matter from many universes outside themselves. But before the stars form, first that matter has to become a giant supernebula with hyperradioactive atom fusing together. And the gravitional forces pulling those atoms to become a very dense star. More and more matter is compressed to a ball, until there's enough force to overcome gravity. A protostar forms. The size of these stars are 1,000 ~ 100 billion ly.

Rarity
[
]
As said above, Omnigiants are not only the largest stars, but also the rarest. On average, 1 out of 10,000
Megaverses
has at least 1 average-sized stars of this stellar class, though the closest one is in
our Megaverse
. This is simply because omnigiants often need a lot of matter to form such stars. And universes don't often die or collapse into near completely ignorable state (when it has little content at all) as those stars need as much mass as a large galaxy at standard.
