Picture of a purple quettagiant (Geraldson 9-21 C)
A
purple Quettagiant
is a rare type of
star
and the second biggest type of star in normal physics, only surpassed by
omnigiants
. These stars are 100 - 1000 light-years in diameter, and their mass can be up to 800 decillion solar masses. They live quadrillions of years, which may be suprising because normally larger stars live less, but purple quettagiants are insanely dense, making them be able to have more fuel to burn. They are most commonly found in
multiverses
.

Types

Purple quettagiants can be divided into three types:

quettagiants are the smallest type of purple quettagiant, having a radius of 100 - 350 light-years. These stars have a more indigo colour.

quettagiants have a radius of 350 - 600 light-years. These stars are a purple color.

quettagiants are the largest type. They have a radius of 600 - 1000 light-years and are pink.
Formation
[
]
The most common way for a purple quettagiant to form is when a
universe
suffers a
big crunch
. Sometimes, this event is cut short, where the matter isn't infinitely compressed, so it forms a star that expands to 100 - 1000 ly.
Fusion
[
]
Instead of fusing hydrogen and helium, purple quettagiants burn
hyperradioactive elements
. Since there are so many of these elements, quettagiants normally go through thousands or even millions of stages that last a couple billion / trillion years. They are able to fuse these elements because of their immense gravity, and these collisions are violent enough to reduce the particles to
strings
.
As fusion input, purple quettagiants use thousands of hyperradioactive elements, and they output:
Heavier hyperradioactive elements, which are used for further fusion
Strings, which normally take a few thousand / million years to leave the core, and then coagulate together into a random
neutral particle
Primordium
theta
and
alpha
, which fuse together into a
megaphoton
and escape (leaving the star as light)
Death
[
]
Purple quettagiants die when they run out of hyperradioactive atoms who have less than ~1 billion protons, which are too massive to be fused with the quettagiant's gravity. This stops any more fusion from happening, which makes the star succumb to its massive gravity, generating a quettanova - a supernova which is millions of light-years large. Sometimes, new universes can be born from quettanovae. Quettanovae will also generate a supernebula.
