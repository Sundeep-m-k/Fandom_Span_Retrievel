Distorted Existence
is a verse where there are purple curved lines everywhere, and 5 stars that supply enough energy together to keep the entire Distorted Existence from falling apart. If a civilization were to harness the energy of a star, they'd have too much energy to use. The stars use a substance called Tenspatialite, a substance that produces enough energy to hold up Time and Space dimensions within the Distorted Existence. Utilizing Tenspatialite can allow the user to manipulate spacetime, being able to add and remove time and space dimensions, seeing across any dimension, moving through any dimension, and more. Many civilizations have tried to achieve Tenspatialite and use a setup of
Computer Particles
to create more Tenspatialite, but failed to get Tenspatialite.
