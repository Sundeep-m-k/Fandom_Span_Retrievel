Orgsper and Bloughun
is the collective term for two conjoined
Verses
floating near the middle of the
Rajackaskwadaverse
that are held together via a double helix made of a particular substance that is uncommon outside of Orgsper and Bloughun.
The two verses have multiple areas of contact and instances where both of them are in the same location. In many cases, this would mean the two verses would merge into a single verse and/or cause collateral internal damage. However, since their dimensionalites are arranged in a certain way and there exists the double helix of substance, it allows them to be conjoined and still maintain a large amount of room for fluidity in the movements and shapes of the two verses.
The image presented depicts a cross section of the arrangement; the apparent sizes are their equators, and a small portion of the double helix is shown to look like a sine parametric.

Orgsper
[
]
Orgsper (shown in red) is the smaller of the two verses, but it is more densely packed with material than Bloughun. Orgsper has gradually gotten smaller over time, because of the amount of mass it constantly ejects to remain stable. It is not a particularly great place to be in, due to its chaotic behaviour.
Orgsper is very sparse, and the only recognisable objects are formed by chance, which are typically temporary. If such objects interact with each other in certain ways, it is possible for them to be transported to a new location, which includes the collision area of the two verses.
Bloughun
[
]
Bloughun is the larger of the two verses, and it contains many more artifacts than Orgsper. Much of the verse is filled with an arbitrarily chosen gaseous material that increases the happiness of whoever is in it for some reason. This makes it relatively common for several organisms to transport their belongings there and live there, but doing this is a controversial decision.
Other than that, there is no life in Bloughun or Orgsper, but there exist several places specially designed for meetups, usually used by anyone who wants to collaborate on a particular plan, which is usually unrelated to Bloughun, Orgsper or the Rajackaskwadaverse. There are other places that can be considered habitable by most standards, but they are often cited as subpar when compared to other residential spaces available.
Formation
[
]
Orgsper and Bloughun was formed when Orgsper and Bloughun, two previously separate verses in the Rajackaskwadaverse, made close proximity with one another somewhere near its middle. This caused them to go inside each other, but due to their dimensionalities being completely separate from one another, they remained mostly unaffected. That was until Orgsper's mass ejection resulted in a new substance that happened to expand itself onto itself to create a helix shape, which was able to hold the two verses together because of its method of expanding into all eight dimensions that Orgsper and Bloughun occupied.
The double helix shape can be seen as a set of particles that can attach to other particles and allow those particles to attach to other particles, which eventually allows the entire verse to act as one solid entity. This is done separately for both Orgsper and Bloughun, meaning the helix can be seen as a connector. The helix does not spiral around very many times, and any line drawn on Orgsper or Bloughun would likely only pass through four or five contact points, but it is still enough to keep them together, and it is reasonably stable.
The Shop

Someone set up a shop at the midpoint of the area where the two verses are in the same location. It was initially created as a project by a couple of organisms who wanted to help out other organisms in the area. Unfortunately, it was not a very well thought out business practice, because nobody actually buys stuff from there. It has remained there unused for a very long time.
