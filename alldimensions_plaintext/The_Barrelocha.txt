The next step in the barrel hierarchy, its rainbow glow comes from the perawood-ammonite mix of its exterior. It has many
Barrelplakanias

Story
[
]
Nobody knows how or why it was created, but someone put PEARs in it one time due to a belief that it made people inside it healthier. Unfortunately, this person accidentally put in poisonous pears instead.
Etymology and Dispute
[
]
The name Barrelocha was chosen by Mick MacMickmonick, who got the original idea from Vawn van Vonarahn, who thought "ocha" was the best unofficial SI prefix used in the Archverse chain. Mick MacMickmonick did not agree with this statement, but was pressured into choosing it so he made it the official name.
There has been a large debate over the years as to whether the "ocha" part is pronounced /oka/ or /otʃa/. Mick MacMickmonick said it was /oka/ but Vawn van Vonarahn said it was /otʃa/ so nobody knows who to believe. One time, at a party, someone hung up a sign that says "it's pronounced /oka/" and this caused someone to punch the sign and it caused the entire house to fall down because the impact was very powerful. This led to the house falling into a formation in which the words say "Hello!"
Grandma's Cloud Farm!
[
]
The cloud farm in the
The Barrelplakania
was so popular, that a sequel was made on top of the Barrelocha. Unfortunately, it was not very good, and it did not receive as much positive feedback as the original version. This was likely due to the fact that the Grandma's Cloud Farm! was handcrafted, but the original cloud farm wasn't.
