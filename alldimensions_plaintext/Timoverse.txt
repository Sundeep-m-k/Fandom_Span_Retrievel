The
Timoverse
(aka Xenobinverse) is a
verse
that, even though it is dead, it still somehow exists. Sounds strange, right? This is because it is an abnormal object that defies
omniversal
physics as we know it.
Timeline

Before 11,000
OYC
, the Timoverse is a normal verse like any other verse.
After 11,000 OYC, and until 11,500 OYC, everything in the verse undergoes a sped-up version of heat death.
After 11,500 OYC, at the threshold when a verse would dissolve during heat death ( ~10
10
45
OYC on average for a regular verse), everything in the Timoverse vanished, but the Timoverse itself remained.
You may be asking yourself a question. Theoretically, if our universe were to die in some way, it would have ceased to exist and there should be no universe remaining. So, how did the Timoverse die and still exist? Is it because it contains dark matter?
Is it because they consider nothingness to be something?
It's, in fact, another way that this verse's physics are abnormal.
