True Kceh
Scale
Size
If a
Primidial godity space
was the size of an
universe
, an average-sized true kceh would be at size of a
Drum
in comparison.

True kceh
- the biggest thing that can exist in theory, and a true analogue of a
kceh
. They constantly become larger and larger every 0 seconds. This of course means the older the true kceh = the larger in most cases, though some of them obviously have higher or lower growth speeds.
Thats pretty much it, there is little else to say about these objects, besides them being green and incomprehensible. Our true kceh is growing so fast, that our local
primidial beyond godities
gave up since these objects simply became too big for their powers to work and stop them, deciding to just keep making
primidial godity spaces
instead.
There's almost no point in putting a lot of information in the infobox, since most of the characteristics (size, dimensionality, etc.) will simply be "beyond".
Beyond Sphere

These are the fundamental particles of a true kceh, being 1/âˆž parts of them. Just like their respective verse, these are on a constant growth.
