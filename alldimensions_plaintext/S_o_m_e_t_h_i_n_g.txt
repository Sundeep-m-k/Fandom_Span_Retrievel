S o m e t h i n g
, also known just as
something
is the end. Something is the biggest thing on this wik- Wait a second,,that's not true!
All of those bright spheres seen on the infobox's image are clumps of
not yets
.
Components

Something is made out of a combination of TREEYUM and Super stones.
Energy supply
[

The MacBookchargerium, with its charging capabilities, supplies the whole verse with a bright light, as you can see in the picture.
A lump of MacBookchargerium is at the center of each not yet lump; that's why the spheres are so bright. So far, the
Elon Musks
have not been able to move around in the dense clusters of not yets and MacBookchargerium.

The edge of this
verse
is currently not known, though some
entities
believe that the
Eye on the Wall
sits somewhere on the inside edge of  S o m e t h I n g.
