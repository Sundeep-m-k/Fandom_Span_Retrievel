Structure
[
]
Nines, unlike most of the other verses in the One Chain, contain way more than just a few of the previous number verses.
Planets
,
stars
, and even entire
galaxies
have been found inside of Nines.
Eights
[
]
Nines have exactly 9
Eights
, which fly inside of their local Nine extremely fast, and can crash into each other, causing matter to spew everywhere. However, this is rare, and once an Eight is destroyed, another one will seemingly appear out of nowhere in order to replace it.
Sometimes, an Eight will fly into its Nine's borders, clipping through it into some unknown area. All attempts by explorers to break through a Nine's borders have failed, and have instead just gotten glitched into
Unexistence
.
Planets
[
]
Millions of separate planets have been found inside of each Nine. Most of these are terrestrial, but some have been seen to be gaseous. So far, 3 types of planets have been found inside of a Nine.
Terrestrial Planets
[
]
These planets are the most common type of planet, and are usually also the smallest. Most Terrestrial Planets consist of metals such as iron, gold, and platinum, but have also been seen to contain traces of calcium, carbon, helium, and hydrogen.
Gaseous Planets
[
]
Gaseous Planets are a little less common than Terrestrial Planets, but are still common nevertheless. They consist of gas (duh), and are usually the biggest.
Plasma Planets
[
]
Plasma Planets are by far the rarest type of planets in a Nine, and resemble more of a star than any real planet. They glow a bright purple, and have been seen to obliterate nearby matter almost instantly. Many explorers have not counted Plasma Planets as real planets, since they are so similar to a regular star.
Stars
[
]
The stars in a Nine usually are quite small, and don't usually have planets orbiting them. These stars have been seen to move randomly throughout their Nine just like an Eight would, and give off lots of light. These stars somehow don't seem to have a Goldilocks Zone, and thus cannot host any life.
Properties
[
]
Nines also have a few interesting properties.
Nines have been seen to rotate and revolve extraordinarily fast around unknown objects of sort that lies beyond then. It is currently unknown how to reach those objects, since the method of using existence states and infinite speeds doesn't seem to work for a Nine's borders. Of course,
Omni-Gods
know how to get past this border, but none have told mortal creatures how to escape.
Nines have been seen to collide with outside objects in predictable intervals. Every time this happens, almost everything inside of the Nine will get destroyed. However, every object will come back seemingly unharmed exactly
Ï€
{\displaystyle  \pi }
days later after the collision. That has led some creatures to believe that Nines are actually going back in time. However, this is quite unlikely.
