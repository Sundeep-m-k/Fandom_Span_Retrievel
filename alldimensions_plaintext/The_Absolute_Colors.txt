. In addition to containing the Infinite Colors, each TAC contains an infinite number of Absolute Colorverses. Each such verse is composed solely of a given color, and the Absolute Colors contains one for each conceivable color within it- creating an infinite number. At the center lies the Infinite Colors, acting as a sort of 'core' of the verse. Each TAC can only contain the colors that exist within its core TIC, meaning different TACs will contain different color sets, as the different laws within higher verses will inevitably lead to variations in conceivable colors within TICs.
