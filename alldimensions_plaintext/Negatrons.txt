Negatrons are a much more charged equivalent to Protons, being made primarily of gluons despite this fact. They have less total mass than a proton, but 7x the charge thanks to their electron count. Negatrons are rarely seen in atoms thanks to their disbalancing charge, and in some universes even orbit molecules like electrons do to atoms. The existence of negatrons at all, however, allow for the existence of many more periodic elements such as heatrit.* Their positive, antimatter equals are knows as Popositrons, to seperate them from the positrons that comprise them.
