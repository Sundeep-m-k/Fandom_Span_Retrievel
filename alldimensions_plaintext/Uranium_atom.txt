Uranium
is a chemical element; it has symbol
U
and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table.
An uranium atom has 92
protons
and 92
electrons
, of which 6 are valence electrons. Uranium radioactively decays, usually by emitting an alpha particle.
The half-life of this decay varies between 159,200 and 4.5 billion years for different isotopes, making them useful for dating the age of the
Earth
. The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 (which has 146
neutrons
and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth) and uranium-235 (which has 143 neutrons).
Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements. Its density is about 70% higher than that of lead and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil, rock and water, and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite.
