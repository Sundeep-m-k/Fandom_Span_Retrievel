Interdimensional foam
is an unstable object of
string
and
Uqraek fibers
that has formed into super-dense pockets of
squik fiber
.
Because of
The Interdimensional foam's
configuration, it only consists of isolated pure
Unknown
objects
. The interdimensional foam also glows and produces heat like stars.

Entering
[
]
While it's almost impossible to enter due to its thick barrier, there is a way. For 1 second. But don't try this if you are at least 5
Vsaue
. As you will probably immediately evaporate.
Structures inside it
[
]
These Unknown structures that are only proven to exist because of UNKNOWN are unstable. Some examples of these structures are (end of UNKNOWN).
classes of Interdimensional foam
[
]
Interdimensional foam is also divided into multiple classes and sub-classes. What determines in which class the object is? Well, it is multiple things. These are the things --> amount of energy, light, heat, size, and density!
Now we will be going over the main classes!
class 0:
These structures are the smallest, safest, and most stable of all of them. They are usually grey or black. As they don't or barely submit light and heat. Class 0 Interdimensional foam has an average size of 8 pm to 15 cm  (most common)
Class 1:
These structures are usually very small and have an average size of 5cm to 18 LY. They are mostly white
Class 2:
Class 2 Interdimensional foam is mostly white or light pink and is less stable than Class 1. These Class 2 objects are usually on average 10 LY to 5080 LY
Class 3:
At this point, the Interdimensional foam is mostly purple or blue, rather than white or light pink, with a darker core. Class 3 Interdimensional foam is usually of an average size of 4500 to 15000 LY
Class 4:
These class 4 structures are very unstable. Their colors can be rainbow plus a darker core, and their average size is 24500 LY to 54860 LY.
Class Ω:
An omega class Structure is so unstable that it shouldn't even exist. Its colors are also basically a rainbow. But its colors are darker than normal. (Only 2 have been found) The only way they could exist is if they were created by beings like
TOG
's.
the surrounding area of interdimensional foam
[
]
class 0:
There is mostly void.
class 1:
In the surrounding area of class 1 structures, can still contain mostly void. And some dust clouds.
class 2:
u can sometimes find foam flares and dust clouds.
class 3:
At this point, there are a lot of things u can find, u can find. A lot of foam flares, some glitchy particles, and foam ripples.
class 4:
to unstable to be properly explored. Only foam flares have been seen from far.
Class Ω:
can not be explored, it is simply too dangerous for any beings lower than the weakest
Omni-gods
. Even they would be weakened for a temporary time. If they would get close enough to explore it.
