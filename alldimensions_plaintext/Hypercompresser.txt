A Hypercompresser is an arbitrarily powerful machine capable of compressing enormus objects into a sphere approximately 1.562 x the size of an average gumball while allowing them to retain all of their properties, anomalous or not. Hypercompressers were machines created by the
Hypreme Lord
to appease a very powerful entity who wanted to make a spherical box but kept failing to do so. This box that was made into a sphere by the Hypercompresser and then expanded again is now the
Spherical Box
in the
Bocks chain
.
After its first use, a Hypercompresser was not used again until 500 OYC later when a group of Cosmic Entities used one to shrink
Reality Bubbles
down to a poppable size. This event garnered the notice of
Alphasm
, whose imagination was much smaller at the time and they built one in the place that they lived in and observed that it still worked and was able to affect non-imagined objects in aforementioned ways. After this incident, it was discovered that Hypercompressers worked on all
Everything Layers
and
Uneverything Layers
and that the Hypreme Lord, a comparatively weak cosmic entity within an infinitely busy and more important being with the only reason of its existence being that it was imagined may have helped contain
BEAN MAN BUT AWESOME
in
The Gatus
. Let me explain, even though there was a way to seal BMBA away, he could simply grow so large that nothing could ever possibly seal him, but a Hypercompresser used on him just before he was sealed made sure he couldn't grow that large.
