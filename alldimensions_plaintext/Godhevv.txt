Contained by:
A random snowglobe with the AOGs.
Contains:
Obliterated good gods
Godhevv is where all the good gods get revived when they get killed or obliterated, and can only be manipulated by AOGs, since no gods other than AOGs have power here. It is the opposite to Godhecc.
Only AOGs can fully obliterate gods regardless of Godhevv or Godhecc. Yeah, there's nothing else to say about Godhevv.

Obliterated bad gods and an
Oven
Godhecc is where all BAD gods get revived. Once again, they are powerless, except they are also tortured here. They get put through pain that happens for no reason, and they also get pulled toward an
Oven
at the center to burn for all hypereternity.
