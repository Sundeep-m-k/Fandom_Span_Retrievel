There is no "why" or "what" or "how" to æther since ÆTHER
IS
those concepts, infact Æther is not even a concept but it's very own self, it is self, Think of The Brightest thing possible and impossible and increase those thing's brightness by 〽️ in a 〽️ amount of times for 〽️ times, those things will still get outshined by ÆTHER so much that it makes all other things look like nothing, it transcends Transcending the concept of lumens, you know
Lord of Lords
? And how he gets more powerful because of basically everything and nothing? Well that doesn't just make Lord of Lords more powerful, it also makes AETHER more powerful, ÆTHER is extremely unimaginable and even beyond that, also fun fact: did you know AETHER is the inventor of creating and destroying, so yeah you should probably thank AETHER for that
