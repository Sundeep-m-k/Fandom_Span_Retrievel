A
Cosmic Zaaaaaaaap
is an
event
that can happen on the
First
Realms
, consisting of a spontaneous cosmic energy strike that can occur in any time, usually ranging from every

to every

OYC.
Most of the time, Cosmic Zaaaaaaaaps will form one or more structures which can be dangerous to both
verses
and
cosmic entities
, such as the
Verse Trap
and the
Lego
.
The strength of a Cosmic Zaaaaaaaap may vary. In the worst case scenario, their strike can even kill an
Alphasm
!
Cosmic Zaaaaaaaaps creating cosmic entities

Other effects of Cosmic Zaaaaaaaaps include a verse / verses being turned into dangerous
sentient
entity / entities. One example of an entity created like this was the
Disruptor
. Although the number of cosmic entities created because of a single Cosmic Zaaaaaaaap is usually one, it can also be 2, 3, 4, or even around 15 at times.
The strength of the entity created depends on the current age of the First Realm affected by it in OYC. If the OYC is prime, the entities created are usually much more powerful, and if the OYC ends with a 0, the entity is much weaker. If the OYC's digits add up to either 16 or a multiple of it, the entity can be insanely powerful, as in the case of the Disruptor.
Origin of Cosmic Zaaaaaaaaps
[
]
The first Cosmic Zaaaaaaaap of our First Realm was recorded all the way back just 54
OYC
after the aforementioned cosmic structure was created. It is unknown why the first recorded Cosmic Zaaaaaaaap occured during this specific time, although most creatures believe that chaotic fluctuations during this First Realm's creation caused the Cosmic Zaaaaaaaaps to emerge. Our first Cosmic Zaaaaaaaap created
a gigantic, poisonous chicken nugget
which has long since been lost to time.
