Stuff about the cyoob core protectors
[
]
They all sit there 24/7 and protect the cyoob core. They are also kind of OP so the cyoob core is hard to destroy, and the cyoob core itself has enough defenses anyway with defenses over 200,000,000x the size of
Beeg Cluster

The Cyoob core

The
Cyoob
core is well, The
Cuaniiyouoityuionverse
. It is protected by the
Cyoob
core protectors, Cyooboid, Cyeeboid and Cuuboid. If the
Cuaniiyouoityuionverse
aka Cyoob core gets destroyed all life in the verse will be destroyed. Also the
Cyoob
will explode probably flinging / destroying the
Tessoract
.
