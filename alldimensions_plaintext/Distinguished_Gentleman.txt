The
Distinguished Gentleman
is a sentient verse currently containing
the Sock
and being contained by
the Vivarium
. It was named by a cult of
Hwagoanoids
worshipping it, named
Cult of The Distinguished Gentleman
, or CoTDG for short. The
Distinguished Gentleman
can be considered a verse, as it has eaten many verses recorded on this wiki, and yes, it is a living being. It was discovered in February 1st, 2024 by a company established by a group of
Kittehs
called the
Yamaversal
Hypercosmology Kitteh Administration, or the YHKA for short. In fact, it was discovered completely by accident. As of now, there is only 1 existing
Distinguished Gentleman
, called DSGM-0.

The
Distinguished Gentleman
was created by a cult living in the closest
Omniverse
to our local one, named
the Cult of Flobobbityblobbityflobobblobobba
, or TCoF for short, which was created in January 1, 231 AD. It's sole purpose is to eat everything, like the
Erxelverses
and everything in the
Vekna
chain. The first things it ate was furniture, people, pets, etc. One minute after it's creation, it started eating huge objects, including
Universes
and extremely tiny bits of the unfathomably large
Shinoverses
. An hour later, it started eating huge stuff, including
Xochaverses
and
Dêaśaverses
.

The
Distinguished Gentleman
grew big enough to eat a
Painful world
itself. It battled with it for 1 hour, leaving the
Distinguished Gentleman
and the
Painful world
both injured and weak. At the end of the fight, the
Distinguished Gentleman
ate the
Painful world
and grew large enough to eat the entirety of
the Extended Post-Hierarchy
's verses. This was when the CoTDG was created. It is unknown what happened afterwards to the
Distinguished Gentleman
, until October 5, 2024, when new activity was detected.

The
Distinguished Gentleman
was seen fighting with an anomalous
Hwagoanoid
that was estimated to be about the same size as them (meaning this is one of the biggest and strongest of their kind ever recorded), and it was discovered that they can talk, presumably knowing languages such as
Puffish
, English, Malagasy, etc.
