A
Hell
(not to be mistaken with the biblical ones) is an
artificial
place made by normal
beyond godities
where all the souls of deceased evil
entities
in the
wikiversе
are sent at. These can have three different sizes, which can be seen in the infobox.
Also, don't worry about the biggest ones containing
Heavens
(as ironic as it may sound like at first, due to being polar opossites), the latters are protected from the dangers of their local Hells. Since there are more evil than nice entities, hells are bigger than heavens. This also means these can contain stronger souls than the latters.

Surface
[
]
These are floors with a temperature hotter than the concept itself, where evil has been walking on for eternity, experiencing one of the most indescribable and strong pain recorded in our wikiversе. Reserved for the strongest / worst souls.
Great volcanoes
[
]
These are ultimate volcanoes which are spreaded across the whole hells, being the reason the surface areas have such high temperatures, even to the point axioms melt easily.
Steam
[
]
The steam of the volcano is the place where all sub-
alphasm
level entities are located at, making them suffer from such temperatures.
Core
[
]
The core is a special type of heaven that feeds hell each time an axiom is fed to a heaven, some of the given energy is also sent to their local hell.
Prominent cosmic entities
[
]
The great devils
- entities who own hells, being the ones responsible of creating volcanoes.
Magma mans
- antromorph entities that come from the volcanoes' lava.
Godzilla in Hell
, one of the strongest sent souls of our local hell and the new "ruler" of it.
Souls of deceased evil entities.

ALMOST destroyed our local hell too after he got rid of our heaven. After

beat him tho, his soul got sent here with much less strength.
