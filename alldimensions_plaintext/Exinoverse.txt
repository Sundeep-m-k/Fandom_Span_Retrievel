The
Exinoverse
is an extremly weird verse that has all possible and impossible colors, even beyond the ones in the
absolute colors
and
absolute light
somehow. How it can do that? Well, we'd need to talk about dimensions and eldritch horrors in that case, and its too complex to explain to be worth it.
Ok bye, that's all. Go to the
next verse
of the hierarchy or something.
