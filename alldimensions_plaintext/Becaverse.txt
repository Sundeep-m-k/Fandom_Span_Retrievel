This Universe has at least a few hundred voids located in it. The biggest being beir-553-21, it is around 400 million light years long there are a few stars and 1,000 galaxies inside the void. The smallest void is rieb-21-355 which is only 100 light years and contains very small stars and solar systems.

Beca-442-121
Galaxies only take up 99.9999999% of the Becaverse. The biggest galaxies in the Becaverse are Beca-442-121 which is 50 million light years. The second largest galaxy in the Becaverse is Beca-244-123 which is 30 million light years. If the Becaverse kept on growing there would be 10^13 galaxies and 10^29 civilizations.
Why doesn't the Becaverse expand.

If the Becaverse kept on growing it would be destroyed to a
Big rip
. If the Becaverse kept on growing it would be 10^14 light years due to it not growing it is stuck at 10^12 light years

This is the original image for the Becaverse.
This will probably be updated sometime in the far future. I may update this page if I get any more ideas for it but for now it will stay like this.
