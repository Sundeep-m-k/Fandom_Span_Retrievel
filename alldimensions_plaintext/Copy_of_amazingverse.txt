This verse is an amazingverse, but many of them. It is a very strong verse, with a black hole in the middle.
Life
[
]
There are more than one million stars on this verse that have life. The largest star with life is about to go supernova soon.
Living things are on stars because their bodies need to have very strong heat. Some stars in this verse have iron cores so yeah.
DNA
[
]
This verse has the power to duplicate itself because it has DNA. This verse was proven to have DNA because the cosmic microwave background was much stronger than usual.
This makes the universe duplicate itself many times, and also often makes it smaller since it needs material to duplicate itself.
