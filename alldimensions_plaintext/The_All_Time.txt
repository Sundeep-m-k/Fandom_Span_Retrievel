About
[
]
The
All Time
is the
evil
counterpart of the
Hyper Dream
.
Story
[
]
It was originally contained by hyper strong chains containing the essence of dead
gods
infused within it, it its the only thing that can stop the All Time from destroying the Hyper Dream and its local
Voidance
completely, even though the All Time is weaker than the Hyper Dream, the All Time can break all odds and kill anything nonetheless.
The Great Separation was so powerful, that it broke the chains off of the All Time. Thus, the All Time started many wars between gods to cause carnage, which did not go unnoticed by the Hyper Dream, locating the All Time, hunting it down, and fighting it head on. The battle lasted for four inverse planck times. And in the end, the All Time won, but the Hyper Dream, fully recovered, found the All Time again, incredibly damaged, and finished the All Time off.
It then managed to contain it again, but with chains infused with the essence of
Him
, the
Creator
and the
Destroyer
, constraining the All Time in a far off piece in our local
White Plain
to this moment in time.
