The
Wekamultonic Geopamulton
is a verse that is shaped like a very complex polymulton (100000000000000000000000000000000000000001D), and is the last unique shape
in
this

(there's

Properties
[
]
The Wekamultonic Geopamulton has a few interesting properties, almost all of them visual.
Expansion
[
]
Every 4 seconds, The Wekamultonic Geopamulton expands and contracts multiple times in different amounts before eventually repeating itself, creating an oscillation, and a surprisingly quick one too. The reason for why this happens is because the forces that
the Red Megamejonic Megamejons
use when they interact with each other creates a expansion and contraction between each of them that happens very evenly and quickly, although when repeated on a large scale makes it much more chaotic.
Colors
[
]
Although the reason why they exist is unknown, we do know what colors are in it, which is the exact amount there are in
The Absolute Light
.
Composition
[
]
The Wekamultonic Geopamulton is mostly composed of Red Megamejonic Megamejons in its actual colored parts and other solid parts, although the voids are composed of
Absolute Darks
