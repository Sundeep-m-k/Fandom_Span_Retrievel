them. Axions are the smallest objects that are partly abstract, and so Axions contain other Axions. There are 5 known types (usually called Classes) of Axions: Class 0 Axions, Class 1 Axions, Class 2 Axions, Class 3 Axions, and Class 4 Axions.
All Axions form a specific linear order or 'statement' within objects, being the main reason these are thought to be axioms. These statements make up all abstract objects entirely. All objects that are smaller than Axions cannot be a combination of physicality and abstraction, because otherwise they would be made up of Axions.

Classes of Axions
[
]
As previously mentioned, there are 5 known types of Axions. All information about what an Axion might be is entirely theoretical, as the number of known axioms do not line up with current set theories.
Class 0
[
]
Class 0 Axions are always found first within the statements of an object, as well as further along sometimes as well. Because of this, Class 0 Axions are thought to be an axiom saying that there exists a certain abstract object. This object is thought to be
null
, as
null
has the shortest Axion sequence, with only 7 Axions.
Note:
null
's Axion sequence is as follows:
0,2,2,3,1,2,3
Class 1
[
]
Class 1 Axions are found throughout Axion sequences and are thought to be a sort of axiom that applies a function (likely the successor function) to a previous object. Because of this, Class 1 Axions are found most commonly after Class 0 Axions.
Class 2
[
]
Class 2 Axions are usually found near the end and center of Axion sequences. The purpose is unknown, although some theories say it has something to do with the
universal
quantifier (i.e. 'there exists', and 'for all'). It also seems to be related to the ‘NOR’ logic gate.
Class 3
[
]
Class 3 Axions are found at nearly all locations within Axion sequences. Its purpose is also unknown. Some Axiologists have suggested that this has to do with equality or the ‘NOT’ logic operator, but there is no evidence to back this up.
Class 4
[
]
Class 4 Axions are the most common type of Axion, and make up all Axion types. This includes itself. Other than this, little is known about Class 4 Axions, although some theories suggest it describes the existence of the axioms themselves. Class 4 Axions are also used to connect Axion genes together (see below).
Axion genes
[
]
The study of Axions, or
axiology
, usually deals with common, short strings of Axions that are found in many particles. These are called
axion genes
, and they can vary wildly in size. Axiologists are able to find patterns in the particles containing specific Axion genes to know what they do, even though we don't know what the axions themselves mean. The collection of Axions within a particle is called its
Axion genome
.
An example of an Axion gene is the
ex-1
gene, which seems to be found only in particles with
Existence Rank
1. Other Existance Ranks seem to be more complex and are not tied to a single gene. The
ex-1
gene is
2

+

{\displaystyle 2\omega +68}
Axions long, and may appear multiple times in a given genome.
Additional experimentation with Axion genomes has been done by stringing different Axion genes together to create new particles. This usually results in the particle being unstable and decaying back into Axions and Axion genes again, but some new particles have been discovered using this. The discovery of new stable Axion genes can also be useful in discovering more particle types.

Defining 'in' or 'inside' is a lot more difficult with abstract objects, however because Axions define these objects, they are thought to contain them.
