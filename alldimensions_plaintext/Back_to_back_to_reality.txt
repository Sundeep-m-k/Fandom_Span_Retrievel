Composition
[
]
Back to back to reality is more of a barrier or a container than anything else. It has only a single Greatest Borger in it, and all the rest is made of a rocky substance and nearly indestructible barrier. The only reason that this verse doesn't collapse into a black hole is because of this barrier that keeps The Greatest Borger in.
Barrier
[
]
The barrier of Back to back to reality is extremely hard, being about 0.0125% the hardness of a
lockverse
. This gives a strange property to Greatest Borger burgers near the barrier, basically slowly making the barrier larger from them impacting the barrier, and the matter getting absorbed.
