Vertex count

Full article:
Vertex
The
vertex count
of a shape is the total number of vertices (
points
that are part of a larger shape) it has. This can therefore be considered the shape's total extent in
zero-dimensional space
.
Vertex count is unitless.
Edge length
[
]
The
edge length
of a shape is the total length of all of its
edges
. This can therefore be considered the shape's total extent in
one-dimensional space
. The edge length of a
polytelon
is called its
length
. The edge length of a
polygon
is called its
perimeter
.
Edge length in physics is measured in metres.
Surface area
[
]
The
surface area
of a shape is the total area of all its
faces
. This can therefore be considered the shape's total extent in
two-dimensional space
. The surface area of a
polygon
is simply called its
area
.
Surface area in physics is measured in meters squared.
Surcell volume
[
]
The
surcell volume
of a shape is the total volume of all its
cells
. This can therefore be considered the shape's total extent in
three-dimensional space
. The surcell volume of a
polyhedron
is simply called its
volume
.
Surface area in physics is measured in metres cubed.
Surteron bulk
[
]
The
surteron bulk
of a shape is the total bulk of all its tera. This can therefore be considered the shape's total extent in
four-dimensional space
. The surteron bulk of a
polychoron
is simply called its
bulk
.
Surteron bulk in theoretical physics is measured in metres to the fourth.
