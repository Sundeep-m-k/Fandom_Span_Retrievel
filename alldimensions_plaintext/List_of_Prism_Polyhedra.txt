Triangular Prism
Wider Scope:
List of Polyhedra by Type
Prism polyhedra are formed by stretching a
polygon
into
three-dimensional space
, or connecting two polygons with rectangles, or getting the Cartesian product of a polygon and a
line segment
(all three methods are identical). As there are an infinite number of uniform
polygons
, there are also an infinite number of prisms.

Henagonal Prism
[
]
A
henagonal prism
is a prism with a
henagon
as the base. Because of this, it is degenerate in normal Euclidean space.
It has the Schläfli symbol
{
}
×
{
1
}
{\displaystyle \{\}\times \{1\}}
, since it is the product of a line segment and a henagon.

Diagonal Prism
[
]
The
digonal prism
is a prism with a
digon
as the base. Because of this, it is degenerate in normal Euclidean space but in some geometries (such as spherical geometry) it can exist properly.
It has the Schläfli symbol
{
}
×
{
2
}
{\displaystyle \{\}\times \{2\}}
, since it is the product of a line segment and a digon. It also has the Schläfli symbol
t
{
2
,
2
}
{\displaystyle t\{2,2\}}
, since it is a truncated Digonal Dihedron and a truncated Digonal Hosohedron (both of which are in fact the same shape).

Square Prism
[
]
A square prism is a three-dimensional shape. True to its name, it has a square base and four triangular faces meeting at an apex and each with one side sharing an edge with the object's base.

pentagonal prism

pentagon
as its base.
