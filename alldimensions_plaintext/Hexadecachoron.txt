Vertex-first projection of a hexadecachoron. In this projection, eight cells are obscured.
A
hexadecachoron
(also called
tetracross
) is the four-dimensional
cross polytope
and the dual of a
tesseract
. It is also called a
16-cell
, due to its 16
tetrahedral
cells
. It has the
schläfli symbol
{
3
,
3
,
4
}
{\displaystyle \{3, 3, 4\}}
, meaning that 4
tetrahedra
meet at each
edge
. Its Bowers acronym is "hex".

The hexadecachoron is the 4-D
demihypercube
, meaning it can be constructed by taking half the vertices of a
tesseract
. It is also a
bipyramid
of an
octahedron
, or a square
duopyramid
. Eight tetrahedra join at each vertex.
Structure
[
]
When seen from one of its cells, the hexadecachoron first has one cell, then four attached to its faces. The next six share an edge with the top cell and are perpendicular to it. The remaining four side cells share only a vertex with the top cell, and are themselves joined to the final cell, in dual orientation to the top cell.
In vertex-first orientation, it is just two
octahedral
pyramids
joined together.
