Chetoma
is a planet that witnessed the
first appearance of the
Yetmmud
.
The
Yetmmud
proceeded to cause
collateral damage, turning the planet into a wasteland full of ruins
. The remaining
Chetoma
residents, who have created cultures of their own on other planets and verses, have been rebuilding the planet for years,
since the apocalyptic event
. This World will still play a role for major cosmic events in the future for many purposes.
The
Chetoma
has 11 countries and 17 inhabited islands, each having their own respective flag.
The year system is devided into KL (Ke-Lum | Anno Domini) and BC (Be-Cantum | Before Christ).
In the year 1 BC, the Theocratic leader
Pnemme Cantum
was born. His leadership of Slemtsu caused
great misfortune and his impeachment is celebrated every year
. Cantum caused over
400 million deaths
, which was 50% of the country's population at that time.

Chetoma
civilization started in
Makira
300 thousand years ago
.
The first temple (M'kim Tkesh - 280,000 BC) and totem (Gogmeg Taa - 300,000 BC) were all built in Makira during the third ice age
.
Makira
has a warm climate with
few native animals
, one of which is the avian with the longest wingspan: The Donwbey Blue.
Most of the country has dry grass, with tall trees that have layered crowns. The country has one of the
highest amount of caves and ravines, while being simultaneously mostly flat-landed
.

Makira
, into Mukmuse and ends at Psumea, while branching off into 4
other countries
.

Psumea
is a mountainous country located in the approximate center of
Chetoma
. It is the largest country of
Chetoma
.
This country introduced taxes to the rest of
Chetoma
in 55,000 BC. It is nicknamed the
'Economy capital
' of
Chetoma
.
Psumea
is the country with the highest amount of caves, with each mountain having at least 2. Although, most are not of high volume, every single cave is of
high importance
. Be it
historical
or
religious;
in the ancient times, every single cave was treasured for its
divine importance
.
Religious texts dating from 100,000 BC and earlier, show that
Ampho-Umsurbiis
, who resided in the now known area of
Psumea
, viewed caves as the impact sites of lightning bolts, which were used for housing. They were viewed as gifts from the
heavenly beings
(plural, since every religion was polytheistic).
Psumea
is also known for its extraordinary bismuth and praseodymium exports.

Vuhmou
is the largest rainforest of
Chetoma
, which the indigeneous Vuhmouii govern.
The
Vuhmou
are very primitive, they are cut off from
most of society due to tens of attacks on their religion in 300,000 - 230,000 BC
. Most attempts at communication with the
Vuhmou
tribes have ended abruptly due to the hostility of their culture.
Their language is notably complex, as a majority of their character is based on their focus on the
imaginary, arbitrarity, abstractions and creativity
, rather than reality.
Living conditions of a normal
Vuhmouan
is of lower quality, since germ theory hasn't been discovered in
Vuhmou
yet.
Despite this fact, concepts such as
algebra, calculus, set theory and topology are common
, even in day to day life.
The average IQ of a
Vuhmouan
is assumed to be around the
130 range
, which is the
highest out of the entirety of Chetoma
.
Vuhmou
has the lowest air pollution recorded on
Chetoma
.
Vuhmou
is divided into 3 sections, which are based on average climate conditions,

diagnosed depression
. This is partially due to the tradional lifestyle and enviroment, with companies and politicians being
objectively the least corrupt
.
Tcumish
has the highest production of literature, art and inventions. This production has been held constant for
tens of
thousands of years

literature in general, as well as paintings, sculptures and more
.

Mukmuse
is a big country between

.
Mukmuse
is a very similiar country to North Korea.
A long history of corruption in the parliament
have left
Mukmuse
in a dystopian-esque statue.
The entire country is surrounded by a
20 meter concrete wall, with barbed wiring at the top and malfunctioning lampposts around the general area
, as well as guard towers and one single entrance, which is open for
1 hour, once a year
.
This country has the highest pollution index, as well as highest
suicides per 1,000 capita, highest cigarette intake and highest diagnosed tuberculosis per 1,000 capita
.
Mukmuse
's history tell a story different to its inevitable end, in fact,
Mukmuse
was once one of the
richest countries, as well as having the highest amount of native animals and plants
. The abundance of moose granted the suffix: -
muse
.
The country has the largest lake in
Chetoma
, which it relies on for its drinkable water (
although, its drinkability is highly controversial
). It must rely on this lake, because it cut off
all ties with other countries, as well as exports and imports

Hjemke
is a country on the far north-east.
The culture of
Hjemke
is
very distinguishable
from the majority of the countries in
Chetoma
. The reason for this is due to their history and relationships with the other countries.
Archaeological finds suggest Hjemkian peoples were
excluded from tribes, towns and public places
.
The reasons for these exclusions is currently unknown. Theorized reasons include:
different skeletal structure, unfamiliar languages or irregular cultures
.
This exclusion went for hundreds of thousands of years
, until the bonds were too broken for the Hjemkians to accept any contact from the outside world, once the rest of
Chetoma
to realize their mistakes.
Hjemkian people were led by a trans-humanist ideologies, which led them to
evacuate a large portion of their population in 57,692 KL
. This was coincidentally only 988 years from the total obliteration of
Chetoma
by a
Yetmmud
.
This sparked major controversies about the remaining Hjemkians, which led to the majority of them to
go into hiding. Only a few remain in the public
.

Xemtua
is a smaller, far-west country.
Xemtua
lies on
many tectonic plates
, ever since 58,000,000,000 BC, when
Chetoma
was birthed from 2 large planets, the
Xemtua
land lied in the center of
4 tectonic plates
.
Because of this,
Xemtua
has the highest amount of earthquakes (6.0 +) per decade: 74.
Xemtua
is known for being highly mountainous and deserted. It recieves very little precipitation per year.
Like Greece, it resides next to, and owns,
many little islands
. The biggest of which are:
Oumet Goa Island, Dantetla Island, Blu Vuwe Island, Sampape Island and Okpod Island, all of which are inhabited
.
Ancient
Xemtua
housed
Qosche predecessors
, also known as Toxqis. That's why they have such similar languages.
Xemtua
, unlike Qosche, has many native animals widely considered as
"unlikable"
, such as the Grey Foot Mosquito, Tender Bender Cock Extender
(known for killing chickens, one of the few animals that Chetoma shares with Earth)
, Red Poison Fly and a few more.

Slemtsu
is the smallest country in
Chetoma.
It is located under Psumea and next to Xemtua.
Slemtsu
, since 40,000 BC, has
been in war with itself
. In 50,000 BC, Proto-Slemtsu tribes, known as
Hugut and Katabb
, came together into one place
(now known as north-east-Slemtsu)
.
Their conflicting religions and cultures sparked the
longest war in
Chetoma
history
. The divide beetween
Cec Gcutwy and Frgma Ki is so strong, that it is visible from outer-space
, since each town uses different light bulbs.
The borders between each capital is around 100 kilometers, where each kilometer squared has at least 1,000 corpses buried under the soil.
Slemtsu
has the lowest amount of foreigners, due to the amount of media coverage of the war,
the immigration office is practically abandoned
.
Frgme Ki is a middle ground between the warzones
, where fighting is not allowed between governing bodies. It is the most peaceful ground of
Slemtsu
, with green hills and healthy lifestyles allowing people to enjoy life to its
fullest extent
.

Ampohema
is a south country, it is the
only desert country in
Chetoma
.
For the longest time,
Ampohema
was
struck with a great poverty
. Its long history of corrupt leaders, who made
terrible financial decisions, led
Ampohema
into an inevitable debt-ridden future
.
Fortunately, since the Gabamo family took over power, their knowledge and power, and former experience in leadership, put the country in a much better position, economically-wise.
Since the Gabamo family's reign, less than only 11% of residents are below the poverty line in income, as opposed to
the 74% that loomed over the country
.
The average temperature in
Ampohema
is 35 degrees celsius, with the record reaching over 45.
Due to
Ampohema
having a long stretch of land, curling back around
Vuhmou
, it has been conspired that the
Ampoheman
government is in
secret contact with the Vuhmou people
. What happens inside Vuhmou is a
large mystery
, that is why this conspiracy theory exists in the first place.

Whilst

aren't officially recognized as

While they themselves don't have governments, each island is governed by the
closest country, or some country that the island democratically chose to be governed by
