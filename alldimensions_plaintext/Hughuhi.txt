Basic Pronunciation
[
]
Let's say a horizontal line makes the 'h' sound. A line can extend downwards from either the middle, left, or right point of the starting line.
If the line goes down from the leftmost point, it will add the long 'i' sound to the beginning 'h' sound
If the line goes down from the middle point, it will make the short 'a' sound to the beginning 'h' sound.
if the line goes down from the rightmost point, it will make the long 'u/oo' sound to the beginning 'h' sound.
2 horizontal lines placed on top of each other makes the hard 'g' sound (sometimes this rule does not apply).
3 horizontal lines place on top of each other  will make the 'y' sound (sometimes this rule does not apply).
Rules
[
]
If a character is just a vertical line, it will default to the short 'a' sound.
The order of pronunciation is top-to-bottom and left-to-right.
If in a character there are 2 'h' sounds right next to each other ("hh"), then change that into a hard "g" sound. Adding an apostrophe between the 2 'h's can
The order of pronunciation (going in rainbow order)
prevent this rule from happening.
If in a character there are 3 'h' sounds right next to each other ("hhh"), then always change that into the "y" sound.
For Hugghiguyughiyuguhian names, they usually do not mean what the characters used to write them mean.
Words can be multiple characters. This is very common in many Hugghiguyughiyuguhian names.
Character Add-ons
[
]
The characters for the add-ons of positivity, negativity, comparative adjectives, the present, the past, the future, less things, and more things, each pronounced "iuh", "ag", "hi", "hiuha", "huhi", "hiahu", "hihu", and "hiah".
Characters can have "add-ons". These "add-ons" are usually used to create comparative adjectives, such as "better", "best", "worse", or "worst". If a word using an add-on is transliterated, it will have an apostrophe divide the add-on's pronunciation and the main word's one.
Add-ons can have different usages.
For example, the add-on for negativity can be used to added onto a character to denote the opposite of that character's meaning, as well as used for comparative adjectives, such as "worst".
The character for "is/are/am" can have either the past-tense/present-tense/future-tense add-on to change it into the past/present/future-tense variant of it. This applies to every character.
The characters for "is/am/are", "the", and "a", each pronounced "hahu", "hiha", and "hau".
