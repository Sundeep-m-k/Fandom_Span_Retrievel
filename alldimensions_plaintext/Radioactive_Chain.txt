The
Radioactive Chains
consist of a chain of 4 verses with the first verse, the Hyperradioverse, having a chance to contain the second verse in the chain, the Megaradioverse. The 2nd verse in the chain then has a small chance to contain the 3rd verse in the chain, and so on.

Hyperradioverse
[
]
Hyperradioverses are infinitely scattered around an
Outside
's edges, and are filled with various
Hyperradioactive Elements
. The elements cannot decay here and must be taken into an
Universe
with the correct decay laws to be processed with a Hypernuclear Reactor. Approximately 13% of them contain a Megaradioverse, and less than 1% of them contain multiple.
Triradioactive+ elements are usually found there, but there's no Biradioactive elements due to not being exotic against the Outside's logic.
Megaradioverse
[
]
Megaradioverses contain some of the higher Hyperradioactive Elements. They are rarely found within a Hyperradioverse, and have a 3% chance to contain an Ultraradioverse, and less than 0.004% contain multiple. Unsustainable pentaradioactive+ elements are commonly found there. This possess a challenge to omniversal civilizations, as it is rare.
Ultraradioverse
[
]
Ultraradioverses are very rarely found within Megaradioverses, more commonly in
Cubic Otherstructures
. They contain the super-high levels of Hyperradioactive Elements. They have a 0.2% chance of containing an Omegaradioverse, and a 0.0000007% chance of containing multiple. Hexaradioactive+ elements are commonly found there.
Omegaradioverse
[
]
This is the last verse of this chain, which is insanely rare compared to others. This verse has no existence rank and consists of really high Hyperradioactive Elements starting at level 10. These must be converted by a Primordial
Imaginary Cube
. Omegaradioverses are only found at abnormal regions in
Cetaverses
, however.
