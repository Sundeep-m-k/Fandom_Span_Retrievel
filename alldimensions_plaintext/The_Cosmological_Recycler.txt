A
Cosmological Recycler
(CR for short) is a
type
of
cosmic entity
that finds any "bad" cosmological structures or entities, destroys them and then transports the matter of the said destroyed objects into the nearest
Recycle Realm
, which are isolated and infinite
voids
of matter for later use by other CRs.
They transports RR matter to form new cosmic objects or entities, though they cannot create new matter. They can change their size to fit into different
verses
, and can teleport anywhere and everywhere to get to places. They're also invulnerable to anything and everything.
One of the Cosmological Recyclers closest to our
Boxial
has been in frequent fights agaisnt another entity known as the
Seeker
, though the latter has continuously succeeded to glitch it into random
Thingks
before the CR can use its transportation.
This CR has also managed to recycle
Bongus
into a primordial god in a different timeline and, it recycled 2 record-holding
Cosmic Consumers
, known as CC-Ceta and CC-Uni-1/2.
