The
Supremum of Noise
is the third smallest, largest, in the center, antipode of the
Grasslands
.
The conceptual jump from order to chaos, is comparable to the conceptual jump from chaos to noise. Noise is reality, nature itself, the beginning of beginnings, the true nature of all of reality. Everything must have been caused by something. Noise is the final iteration of this statement, i.e., the background of everything and the causation to itself and all.
This verse is unable to be escaped unless you break logic, making the object go into a superposition of existence ranks, and making the object travel to every timeline simultaneously, causing the object to ascend beyond the concept of
timelines
.
The dimensionality mentions the
C
n
{\displaystyle \mathcal{C_n}}
function and
θ
{\displaystyle \theta}
. The
θ
{\displaystyle \theta}
is the strongly inaccessible cardinal
(now more and more referred to simply as the "inaccessible cardinal" without a prefix)
, and
C
n
{\displaystyle \mathcal{C_n}}
is the chaos function
(described in the article for the
Supremum of Chaos
).
The
Thubbunurrhypil
get more and more distorted, as one travels up in size to the antipodes. In the Supremum of Noise, this isn't apparent at first, but one can notice that it has
2 different areas of convergence, yet the share the same one. That point being the finality of existence.
Barely anything is known about the Supremum of Noise. The problem with objects of this magnitude, distance and uninterpretability, is that nobody has a way of proving anything,
as experiments can't be conducted and even trying to view the Supremum of Noise is a hassle.
Since the convergence points turn into noise, the same thing that comprises the 8th
realm
, it is entirely possible that the Supremum of Noise is in actuality a portal, a gateway to the 8th realm.
Because of the fact that the point is made out of 2 converging series of
Thubbunurrhypil
, and the noise therein is known as
the permanence of reality of both back and fourth,
this could mean that the noise is actually made out of two other sub-noise channels, and isn't the finality it speaks of. In fact, these two hypothetical channels could be the Thubbunurrhypil, as they themselves are made out of noise.
If we use the same thinking as in when combining the
Supremum of Order
and the Supremum of Chaos, we might come to the conclusion, that the Supremum of Noise
also shares the same singularity as the other two, together all three making the triple of reality.
Unfortunately, we have absolutely no known way of proving these 3 theories currently.
