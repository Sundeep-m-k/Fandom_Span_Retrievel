The
Torus Chain
is a category of verse that has an infinite number of torus-shaped verses that are made from a manifold grid from the last, creating another torus, most with different properties.
Verses in the Torus Chain
[
]
Tworusverse
- this has its own page.
Trirusverse - This verse is made of tworusverses, the light from Möbistars reflects like a prism.
Quadrusverse - High temperatures make this verse make light much more high energy, allowing for many gamma ray bursts.
Quinrusverse - This verse is sometimes unstable due to being hit by gamma rays.
Hexusverse - This verse is more opaque than the others, and filters light so that only ultraviolet light and lower can get through.
etc.
It is theorized that around 2.1 x 10
22
verses into the Torus Chain, verses stop being unique from the previous and all become gray.
Properties
[
]
The Torus Chain is similar to
The Box
in some ways, because any object in the Torus Chain always has an object that contains it. For the Box, it contains itself, but The Torus Chain isn't one single thing, because it's a
group of verses
, not a verse. The entire Torus Chain can still be contained by some things, due to the Box axiom. We can use the Box axiom to our advantage here, and find objects large enough that they contain the Torus Chain. It should also be noted that anything that contains the entire Torus Chain cannot be fully contained within the Box, because of the second part of the Box axiom.
Miscellaneous
[
]
The reason the Torus Chain starts at Tworusverse and not the Onerusverse is because originally the
Toriverse
was called a Onerusverse, but was later declassified as being in the Torus Chain, and the name was changed.
