The Betasm-Alphasm-Oni Megacity-Planet is a large planet/verse that is purely a large city that is filled with tons of different beings and people and all that. It has been visited by cosmic entities such as
The Bat-GOD
. As the city/verse/planet is so large, there have been many projects to form a sort of internet-like connection to communicate from different parts of the city/verse/planet to each other. There are several interesting locations to see in this place if you know where to look. It continually grows as its inhabitants assimilate more and more resources from other (usually dead) planets and other objects (moons, asteroids, stars, etc.) In 409
OYC
, it will become larger than a
Universe
. Its one civilization's Kardashev scale is 3. Many are drawn here to hide or live there. The planet has no singular ruler right now, but not for a lack of trying, as some minor cosmic entities have tried and failed.
