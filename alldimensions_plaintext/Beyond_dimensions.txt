Dimensions are realms where each entity class exists within. While only very few classes surpass dimensions, there exists way more than that :
Cardinality
: The cardinality system holds dimensions and their dimensional dimensions | Omni-god class or higher
Cardinality 1 : The set of all dimensions
Cardinality n : The set of all dimensions of dimensions of dimensions... ( n times )
Cardinality ω : Infinitely iteratable dimension
Ascendence
:  Ascendent omni-god class or higher
Ascendance 1: The set of all sets 1's
Ascendance n: The set of all sets n's
Ascendance
Δ
{\displaystyle \Delta}
: The infinite set of all infinite sets of all infinite sets of all infinite sets
Δ
{\displaystyle \Delta}
times
Transcendence
: Cardinality also has a limit : ω | Transcendent Omni-God class or higher
Transcendence 1 : Realm of every ascendence with 1 set
Transcendence n : Realm of every ascendence with n sets
Transcendence ω : Realm of ascendence with infinite sets
Paradox
: Each paradox has its own rules | Paradoxical class or higher
Paradoxes have their own symbols to represent them ( let's say there are infinite letters ) :
Paradox A : Infinite space of every structure
Paradox n : Infinite space^n of every structure
Paradox AA : Infinite space^space of every structure
Paradox nn : Infinite space^space^n of every structure
This list goes on for an eternity
Zenithal
: The architects who have created every entity who has created every wiki who has created every entity who has created every wiki.... and this goes on
It is not known how the architects were created but what is known is that they have created everything , un-everything , in-everything , omni-everything , nothing , un-nothing , in-nothing , omni-nothing... and even this goes on.
