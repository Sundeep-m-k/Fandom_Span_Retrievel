The Big Suck is a doomsday scenario in which a
Wheel
spontaneously loses all of its gravity or whatever force that keeps it together. It is essentially the Big Rip, but it deals with things that are many orders of magnitude bigger than a single universe.

Phase 1: Wheel Destabilization
[
]
This phase takes the longest to run its course. Once a Wheel loses all of its binding force, it will take awhile for anything important to happen, since even the supremums pale compared to the sheer size of the Wheel. What I’m trying to say is that things will move differently, but they’ll never cover enough ground to “escape” the wheel. Eventually, over countless eons, a black hole comprised on the mass of many, many supremums will form, due to the absence of Wheel gravity that would normally prevent black holes that radiate faster than the speed of light from forming. By this point, it is spinning so inanely fast that it enters the territory of [infinite ordinal] revolutions/second. This black hole will still be small compared to the total mass of the Wheel, but it will start to spin so absurdly fast that it doesn’t just cause space time ripples, it RIPS IT APART.
Phase 2: Destruction of Space-Time

This creates a death wave that destroys the black hole and envelops the entire Wheel in seconds before being effectively halted by extreme distance. 99.999999999999999% of The Wheel will survive this initial death wave, but those -verses that reside outside of a supremum will be obliterated. Now that The Wheel is inside of the death wave, the rules change. Space-Time was ripped apart and now it was put back together and this allows -verses and supremums to travel at insane speeds, enough to escape The Wheel.
Phase 3: Hyperspeed Dispersement and Space Time Anomalies (Great Reapings)
[
]
After a few quadrillion years in the death wave, ~1% of all of the Wheel’s mass has been ejected. Nothing has been destroyed yet, but that will change soon. After ~2.26805% of all Wheel mass has been ejected, the newly-cobbled together space-time fabric will become unstable and the first great reaping occurs.
During the first great reaping, everything bigger than a Box will lose its gravity. This makes supremums impossible after a few nanosconds and reality starts to change radically. The Wheel loses its color as its biggest structures just go poof.
After ~34.57625% of all Wheel mass has been ejected a few billion years later, the second great reaping occurs. This affects anything bigger than an Archverse and makes forming Boxes impossible. Now that the main constituent of The Wheel and the gateway to the -verses has been broken, it is now impossible for anything outside of The Wheel to access anything in it. The distances are too great to travel.
After 76.67367% of all Wheel mass has been ejected a few thousand years later, the third and final great reaping happens. This is the worst reaping on this list, as it only spares things that are a universe’s size or smaller. Normally, this would be fine, but now that universes, the most fragile -verse of all, have no protection from the weird entropic and physical laws of outside, they start to die off rapidly. A decade or so later, any universe left in The Wheel will either be chilled to absolute zero, have reached its maximum entropic value or will have been consumed by a false vacuum. The Wheel is dead.
Phase 4: What About the Stuff That Got Ejected?
[
]
Since supremums still exist in a small portion of the ejected Wheel stuff, order and chaos will continue to exist in some parts. There will also be Boxes present in a good portion of the ejected stuff, so it is accessible. The things that fare the worst in this scenario are anything that has neither a supremum nor a box, since it is effectively barred from travelling any significant distance due to the finite space that it inhabits. Other than that, all that remains of The Wheel are a bunch of bloated and dead universes that will eventually become so large that they will become supremums and eventually an entirely new Wheel.
