The Deep Blue
Natural Position
Contained by
Upper Spaces
Contains
Relative Spaces
This is the container of our
Relative Space
and all possible others. The reason for its blue color is unknown, but it is what gives our
Megaloverse
its blue color.
The spaces contained in the Deep Blue are spaced unevenly and the whole area is known to be quite chaotic in nature. Our own space is located in a void of the Deep Blue, so the risk of it colliding with another space is slim.
