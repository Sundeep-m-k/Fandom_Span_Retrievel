Berry-verse
Some blueberries harvested from planets in the Berry-verse.
Scale
Size
Each layer compared to the last is around 754 billion ly (comparatively) compared to ~481.92 μm
The largest layer is infinitely big, and the smallest infinitely small, so the Berry-verse as a whole is infinitely big.

A few strawberries harvested from the Berry-verse, cut in half. Berry-verses can be seen within.
The
Berry-verse
is a
Berryverse
. The Berry-verse contains berries (both botanical and culinary berries), with each berry containing several copies of the Berry-verse inside itself. These Berry-verse copies contain berries which contain other Berry-verses, and so on, fulfilling the Berry Paradox, and therefore, the requirements to be a Berryverse.
It is uncommonly considered to be a
Dualverse
because the Berry-verse contains berries which contain Berry-verses, not the Berry-verse directly containing other Berry-verses. However, this position is disputed because most people think that the berries don't count as verses.

Galactic level

An iteration of the Berry-verse will often contain galaxies, star systems and clusters, black holes, etc. as a normal
Universe
does, although there are occasionally huge swaths of juice or other berry innards coming from the berry insides bypassing the verse barrier.
However, star systems never consist of more than two or three planets, with all of the planet(s) in the solar system being in the habitable zone of the star. These planets have no moons, and are never tidally locked. There are also no rogue planets or planets orbiting non-stars (brown dwarves, black holes, neutron stars, etc.)
Planetary level
[
]
On an individual planet in the Berry-verse, there are a lot of trees, usually covering almost 70% of the surface of the planet (the 30% is almost always ocean). These trees are fruit trees, growing edible berries that normally occur on trees from
UNI-1
. There are a lot of bushes too, with all of them growing edible berries that also normally occur on bushes from
UNI-1
.

A berry, when growing in the Berry-verse, undergoes an as-of-yet unknown mechanism that causes Berry-verses to manifest inside, or very rarely, outside the berry. This includes berries from the Berry-verse, and berries imported from outside sources.
Consumption of a Berry-verse berry has no ill effects, as the Berry-verses permanently and spontaneously disappear upon the berry being ingested by any living organism.
It is thought that when Berry-verses inside a berry manifest, they manifest with galaxies, planets, stars, etc. within. This hypothesis has sparked many c̸̹͆ǒ̴̠n̵̛̳s̵͖͑ṗ̶̜i̶̟̕ŕ̷͜a̷͙͊c̸̦̓i̶̹͒é̵̱ŝ̸̝

about the creation of the Berry-verse. Berries with Berry-verses are able to be sliced and other maneuvers without the Berry-verses dematerializing. One could even very meticulously 'pluck out' a Berry-verse, despite their comparative small size.
Though, during these procedures, one must be careful, as it is very easy to accidentally puncture a Berry-verse, leading to a
Ruptureverse
, as well as strange effects occurring throughout the entirety of the berry and the rest of the Berry-verses, and sometimes beyond if the Berry-verse in question is especially exposed to open space.

In addition, if you were to not go through to the next layer of Berry-verses, you would end up at atoms, subatomic particles,
Uqraek fiber
, and so on, with the structure being the about the same as an average Universe.
