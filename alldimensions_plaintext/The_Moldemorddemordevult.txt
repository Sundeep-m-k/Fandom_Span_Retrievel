Moldemorddemordevult bricks
The Moldemorddemordevult is a verse that contains Moldemorddemordevult bricks, which are super hard materials capable of speeding up and slowing down time. Inside The Moldemorddemordevult, time doesn't quite work. In fact, time is gone and doesn't exist inside this verse, due to it being filled with Moldemorddemordevult bricks which of course can change the speed of time. Anything that enters the verse can only be inside for 20 minutes before turning into a Moldemorddemordevult brick.
What this thing does
[
]
The Moldemordemordevult constantly seeks other verses to consume, when it finds one, it will instantly "eat" the verse and convert it to Moldemorddemordevult bricks. Once it gathers enough mass, it will split and continue the cycle. Basically, eat, split, repeat. The Moldemorddemordevult is also powerful enough to convert gods into Moldemorddemordevult bricks, but it takes 10

years to do that. Higher level beings may take even longer to be converted.
