This is a list of Omnisecurity protocols. Omnisecurity protocols are, simply put, protocols that are set in place to prevent some “Meta-Servers” from being exploited.
As the list expands, the security protocols become newer.
OmniSecurity
OmniSecurity+
Omni2Security
Omni2Security+
OmniSecurityX
OmniSecurityY
OmniSecurityZ
OmniHyperSecurity
OmniHyperSecurity+
OmniHyperSecurity++
OmniHyperSecurity+++
As of now, OmniHyperSecurity+++ is the most modern and safe security protocol.
It is unlikely we will have a new protocol anytime soon, as the more secure the protocol is, the harder and more complex it is to build. It is said that the next new protocol,
OmniHyperSecurityX
, won’t be released until about ~10^10^100 more OYC. But at the same time, a server using OmniHyperSecurity+++ won’t be getting hacked anytime soon, either.
