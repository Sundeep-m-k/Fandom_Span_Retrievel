Darkcosmos
is an universe made entirely of
Dark Matter
. It is invisible to normal technology, and anything that is not dark matter that attempts to enter Darkcosmos is immediately turned into dark matter. The only way to observe events inside Darkcosmos is to use a gravitational wave detector from outside of it.
