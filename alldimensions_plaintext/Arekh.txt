Arekh
is a massive sentient -verse situated near
The Factor
. It is is able to dispose of -verses created by The Factor which are deemed too dangerous or "low-quality". It can also "fix" -verses which it has either disposed of or known about, or transport them to a shadow-realm where the -verses are rebuilt or destroyed, depending on its characteristics.
Sentience and Poor Reputation
[
]
Arekh
appears to be sentient. It is unknown when it became sentient, as the original construction plans for Arekh did not mention Arekh being planned to have sentience. Arekh's sentience is limited, although it is at least intelligent enough to communicate with creatures via sending packets of information to them, albeit just barely. This has given Arekh a relatively bad reputation as unreliable and unhelpful in getting rid of -verses.
Arekh has been reported to frequently say these few lines:
"Alright, moved."
"Going to revamp [-verse name]."
"Will expand this [-verse] later."
History
[
]
Arekh was first constructed in 428
OYC
. At first, it was not sentient, and was run by a group of powerful cosmic entities. Arekh continued to be used for many more OYC, although they started to be used less and less. During this period, Arekh gained sentience, although nobody realized it for a very long time. 2018 OYC later, Arekh was raided by a large group of rogue, sentient
Utilibots
due to Arekh gaining sentience and growing too powerful.
Arekh was almost destroyed, until in 2521 OYC, when it was rebuilt by an unnamed Omniversal civilization. After that, Arekh was used extensively by the civilization, mainly to dispose of -verses. After the civilization collapsed in 2651 OYC, Arekh started to do things by itself. This was also when it began to develop a bad reputation.
