Allomniverses
Omniverseplexes
are "clusters" of
Omniverses
, while also containing their other variations such as
Pseudo-Omniverses
and
Generic Omniverses
, and sometimes even
Allomniverses
.
They're pretty similar to the Allomniverses, with the principal differences being:
Their size
: Omniverseplexes are larger than Allomniverses, and in fact they're so large their scale even exceeds the one of a
Box
, which are known for containing Allomniverses.
AllOmniverses cant hold Generic Omniverses within them due to their scale.
Omniverseplexes' density can greatly vary, ranging from low (omniverses being separated around ω
ω
LY from eachother) to extremly high (something similar to the infobox's image). Of course more density can cause omniverses to attract and destroy eachother, but if the density is low then they can be created more easily, so an Omniverseplex's density changes quite frequently.
Due to the sheer amount of Omniverses and variants located in an Omniverseplex,
Omniversal Waves
are found pretty much everywhere and the higher the density of an Omniverseplex, the higher the amount of Omniversal Waves within them.
Conquered Omniverseplexes
[
]
Omniverseplexes that have been properly taken by a civilization can be modified so they have a more stable density. This is done via manipulating the Omniversal Waves within them so they can give orders to their local Omniverseplex to know when to generate more verses or stop that task.
