Blueprint Particles
are the
nigh-
ultimate building blocks of an
Archreality
, at an indescribable
Composition Tier
.  They construct existence states, energy, matter, light, sound, mind, and more. The only things more basic are

see

page for explanation).  The inferior Archrealities within a Blueprint Particle define that Blueprint Particle's properties, so the Blueprint Particle is not self-containing, despite it being the "ultimate" building blocks.
We can't see something as small as a Blueprint Particle even with the best technology. Even if we could, light waves at the Blueprint Particle's scale don't exist, as Blueprint Particles compose light, thus it is invisible. If something isn't composed of Blueprint Particles (not including
·
and
⬤
) from our Reality, then they're simply on a Subreality.
If you try to split a Blueprint Particle, it'll put itself back together, similarly to other  Archrealities; a lonely group of properties leads to undefined gaps, causing unintended chaos.
Since they are the ultimate building blocks, you can re-arrange them into entirely different things. If you have for example some
Primordium Alpha
, and you want to turn it into
Primordium Delta
, you can decompose it into
Chaos Fabric
then look at the Blueprint Particles, then re-arrange the Blueprint Particles into the Chaos Fabrics that compose Primordium Delta.
Another example is, if you have a whole ton of
Dentists
and you want to compose them into a
Heck
, you can look at the Blueprint Particles of the Dentists, then re-arrange them into the arrangement of Blueprint Particles in a Heck, then you have a Heck. Anything at most the size of Chaos Fabric is most likely composed purely of Blueprint Particles.

Holding Them Together
[
]
They, unlike
Primordium Delta
,
Primordium Alpha
, or any Primordium Particle, don't need anything to hold them together. They pack themselves together and are arranged to form different things, while with Primordial Particles on the other hand, need Primordial String to be held together.
This can't be force, since Blueprint Particles already compose force. They somehow just do this.
Relation with
The Core of Everything
[
]
These particles have a relation with
The Core of Everything
, as TCoE projects the Blueprint Particles into the Everything based on the information inside TCoE.
Types
[
]
There are many different kinds of Blueprint Particles that compose different things.
Wave
[
]
Wave Blueprint Particles are Blueprint Particles that compose waves like light, sound, and more.
Existence
[
]
Existence Blueprint Particles are Blueprint Particles that compose existence states. They're spread across webs of Blueprint Particles and there are 2 kinds.
They can be found anywhere, although sub-existence rank properties are required to make this type of Blueprint Particles in
subrealites
that are 4 - 5 levels below our
Reality
. Anything isn't composed of them is simply a pre-• object, like ￼
Subexistions
.
Existence-1
[
]
An Existence-1 Blueprint Particle is an Existence Blueprint Particle that adds a fraction of 1 to the object's existence state. The "whiter" it is, the more it adds and the "greener" it is, the less it adds.
Existence-0
[
]
An Existence-0 Blueprint Particle is an Existence Blueprint Particle that subtracts a fraction of 1 from the object's existence state. The "blacker" it is, the more it subtracts and the "greener" it is, the less it subtracts.
Property
[
]
Property Blueprint Particles basically program the properties of a structure of Blueprint Particles through a complex way. Property Blueprint Particles take up most of the structure of a construction of Blueprint Particles.
They are the only type that are computed from subrealities, not realities.
Dimensional
[
]
Dimensional Blueprint Particles have the largest structure, which covers the entire Reality. It was discovered by an unintended experiment led by unknown entities.
They have a pattern from a single cluster that forms Dimensions, which contains any amount of Blueprint Particles from Microdimensions, which are Dimensions, but determine the quantity of Dimensions by  Subrealities. Everything that form spacetime dimensions is called Primordial Foam, which can be read in a different
page
.
The cluster has a special property called "Distortion," which is currently the only observed property that is exclusive to Blueprint Particles. It determines its own range of the number of dimensions.
After a lot of distorsing (around 2 or beyond), there is a 10% chance that the spatial area may become non-euclidean.
Function
[
]
Function Blueprint Particles are often grouped up to form Function Structures, which program functions and concepts for our Reality. They weren't used to program properties. There are 5 types of Function Structures, which can be mixed up:
Conceptualize the properties for post-Blueprint Particle objects.
Conceptualize the other kinds of Blueprint Particles.
Take the actions and reactions by rearranging.
Program the changes for objects with different quantities of the same property.
Program new Function Structures, whether
which subject they took.
They were the first Blueprint Particles appeared from our reality but remain hidden from us. When they appeared, there are an indefinite amount of unique Function Structures, which make up everything.  Without them, Blueprint Particles would be stuck as
·s
forever, not even the
⬤
ones.
Force
[
]
Force Blueprint Particles are injected into constructs of Blueprint Particles to make the constructs move and die out unless Force Blueprint Particles are constantly being injected to continue the force.
An undeterminable number of Force Blueprint Particles can be grouped to form the defensive force for the border of a single Verse.
Fabric
[
]
Fabric Blueprint Particles are somehow smaller than usual and make up something called
Chaos Fabric
(or Blueprint Fabric), a foam that makes up the shells of everything except other Blueprint Particles.
