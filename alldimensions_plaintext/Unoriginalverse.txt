The Unoriginalverse is an indescribable amalgamation of stolen and unoriginal concepts from every other verse accidentally created by
Bean Man
.
Technically, it’s a new concept, being a combination of all non-new concepts, so it’s not all unoriginal, so it causes a paradox. These paradoxes are also an unoriginal concept, you know what, let’s just not talk about the paradox.
OOOH I’M GONNA REMOVE ALL THE INFO AND LEAVE ON-
QUIT IT! YOU GUYS DON’T CONTROL THE PAGE!
BUT I WANIT BE NICE AND SHORT-
HOW WILL THEY KNOW WHAT THE VERSE IS IF THEY ONLY HAVE AN INFOBOX?!
Sorry, these people of the concepts always think they’re in charge.
These concepts include it’s the biggest verse. It is the smallest verse. It is the most powerful verse. There are many more than those 3, however. It also has Finality Index NaN, and EUSI NaN. If a verse has a concept that the Unoriginalverse doesn't have, the Unoriginalverse will give itself that concept.
