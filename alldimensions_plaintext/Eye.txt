The Eye is a cosmic entity that rules over the
Seeverse
, with its 4 brothers. It hates being made fun of and shoots lasers at entities who do. The Eye's lasers are made of gamma rays.
The Primordial
created him 10^10^10^10^3067
OYC
after he spawned in. He was put in
Inane
a few times by
Bongus
, but he hated it and used his lasers to bust out. He is now on the loose. No one has found him yet, and people think he's hiding in
The Outside
.
Not to be confused with
The Eye
, a way stronger entity.
