Strange Matter
is a type of
matter
that is a soup of normally unstable
quarks
that, when put together, becomes extremely stable. It is extremely difficult to transform it into any other type or state. This matter is indestructible and has the notable property that when nearly all other types of matter interact with it, the matter is quickly transformed into strange matter. When one particle of strange matter, known as a
strangelet
, interacts with a proton or a neutron, the particle is transformed into another strangelet after approximately 12 picoseconds.
