Helpp
[
]
Helpp is the creature who rules over FreeEdit. It is extremely protective of FreeEdit, and has been seen to violently kill whoever comes inside of it.
Powers
[
]
Helpp has total control of everything inside of FreeEdit, and can do anything it wants inside of it, such as create matter out of nothing, change and manipulate fundamental forces, and grow to an absurd size. However, Helpp cannot manipulate or have control over objects outside of FreeEdit, whether Helpp is inside of FreeEdit or not.
Origins of Helpp
[
]
It is thought that Helpp was a
The Hugghiguyughiyuguhian
victim of
The Filter
that managed to escape, albeit with severe wounds. Helpp would later die from their injuries. After around 5551
OYC
, Helpp's corpse was found drifting around the
Omniverse
, floating aimlessly. Helpp's corpse was then brought back to life through still unknown means and put in FreeEdit and given omnipotence in it. No one knows who did this or their motives behind it.
Structure
[
]
FreeEdit can have whatever structure it wants, since Helpp can manipulate it freely. Usually, the main verses inside of FreeEdit are small, "bubble-verses", copies of regular
Archverses
, or gigantic cubes of some sort.
Bubble-verses
[
]
Bubble-verses are the primary type of verse inside of FreeEdit. These verses are usually quite small, at only 1 LY, and can "pop" very easily when coming into contact with other matter.
Helpp has been seen to use Bubble-verses to satisfy its never-ending boredom, and also to get rid of outside life trying to get inside of FreeEdit.
Archverse Copies
[
]
Helpp has also been seen to create small copies of Archverses. These Archverses do not include the
Omniverse
, which is slightly strange.
Helpp can also grow each Archverse to their regular size.
Massive Cubes
[
]
Many massive cubes can also been seen inside of FreeEdit. These cubes are routinely used by Helpp to build massive structures, such as cube towers, cube buildings, or simply bigger cubes.
These cubes are usually 4~10 LY wide, depending on the intended usage by Helpp.
