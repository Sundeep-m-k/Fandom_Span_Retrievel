The Atomverse is mainly a theory but purposes that in every
Atom
in the
Universe
has a universe inside of it. They all follow every rule of the
Universe
but did not have a big bang, and have random clutters of; Planets, Stars, Galaxies, etc. The theory is quite new and most of these Atomverses are unknown. What is known is that at the center of each one, is an exact replica of our solar system, we do not know how this is possible but it is widely believed that these are older concepts of our origin
Universe
.
History
[
]
The Atomverse was originally thought of during the 19th century, but it is unknown who came up with the original theory. The Atomverse was originally named the Miniverse, until we figured out that they aren't actually "mini".  Many Organizations including; NASA,
AERO
, and others, have worked hard to learn more about the origins of the Atomverses and the many cosmic entities inside of them.
