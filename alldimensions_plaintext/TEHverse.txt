INTRODUCTION TO THE VERSE
[

TEHverse
is a
very weird and interesting verse
. It contains many civilizations and weird structures. It is very weird.
STRUCTURE OF THE VERSE
[
]
STRUCTURE OF THE VERSE
[
]
The TEHverse has potentially the most boring structure in existence, as noted by most travelers of the realms. It is composed of exactly 5 undulating rings made up of a completely unknown substance. Everything about this -verse is completely unknown and very interesting and very weird.
The TEHverse, contrary to popular belief, is not composed of rings.
LIFE
[
]
The TEHverse has just one intelligent species, known as the
HDFfdfkgyj
. The HDFfdfkgyj were forced into seclusion by an unknown species around 50,000 OYC ago, and as of now are bound onto a single planet. They have not been able to develop space travel.
The HDFfdfkgyj is a very cool species, it eat space rocks floating in the space, it is the only intelligent species on the cosmos but others didnt think so and they got absolutely screwed so they teleported to a prison in the center of the verse, and all but one died there and then the HDFfdfkgyj disappeared and never came back, it is thought that they might exist somewhere in the Tehverse but noone knows where.

Weird and Interesting Verse
[

"Of course, everything above is completely stupid. None of it is remotely true; the TEHverse is in no way weird or interesting. Instead, it is considered by nearly all intelligent lifeforms to be the most boring thing to have ever graced the post-post-post hierarchy." ~ Hdfjfhejsfh
The TEHverse is suspected to be the origin of the so-called "weird and interesting -verses". Over the OYC, its properties and essential information allowing for its existence have been chipped away by advanced civilizations, resulting in a peculiar lack of information in some of its spatial/temporal regions, or complete nonsense in others. This has resulted in numerous contradictions and logical paradoxes which make entering the -verse dangerous. Although the TEHverse has been damaged beyond repair, its clones, most of which were created by
The Ripoff
, have barely been targeted. For much of recorded history, these clones or near-clones had not been discovered by civilizations, and it was thought that their locations were only known to the divine.
In 93 OYC, it was discovered that the TEHverse is a
Chained Verse
. This prompted more attacks on the -verse, in an attempt to destroy the TEHverse's copies or near-copies. Whether these attempts at annihilation only damaged the TEHverse or damaged the -verse's copies is still unknown, as no creature or civilization has determined what type of Chained Verse the TEHverse is.
In 600 OYC, a mysterious deity of extreme power transported the TEHverse into an unkonwn region of the First Realm. After this event, the amount of TEHverse copies dramatically increased, many of which were successively nested within each other. It is believed that this cataclysmic event was the result of god-like entities interacting with the TEHverse. These -verses began to take up space and corrupt other important -verses and structure within the First Realm. This gradually increasing hierarchy of -verses continued to grow until an attempt was made to cap it off by connecting it with indescribably larger cosmic structures.
