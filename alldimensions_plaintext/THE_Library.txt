, hence their quite straightforward name.

Main components

These libraries contain the
Trees of Order
(which organize most verses/
voids
in a tree-like structure that defines size and containment based on position), the
Hallways of Dimensionality
(which define what each dimension is and what dimensions are included in which verses), and the
Hypercomputers
(which simulate
artificial
verses). The latter, despite possessing infinite computing power, become slower the more verses there are, which explains why they don't execute everything, but rather, a lot of the functions are achieved by other objects.
Local lifeforms
[
]
Projectors
[
]
Beings
known as the
Projectors
project their Libraries, and all the
matter
in them. They can even control the size of matter projected from them, allowing their local Library to change size based on the biggest thing without metasize. This makes the Projectors achieve a
godlike
status. This is why a Library containing more than one Projector is almost never seen.
More about metasize
[
]
THE Libraries aren't contained by the Trees of Order, because they have metasize. An object's position in their local Tree of Order is based on the latter's size, and the Trees are made in such a way that they block duplicated verses and verses with an uncountable infinity of positions on their Tree.
The objects in THE Libraries all have uncountable infinity (in quantity) of sizes as they have metasize, thus preventing them from being contained within their Tree of Order.
THE Woodants
[
]
THE Woodants
are organisms known to feed on Trees of Order. This harms the verses within them, explaining why some verses in the Trees "get deleted"; they no longer contain anything or are contained by anything, which causes them to get erased from existance. However, some isolated dimensions or -verses can avoid this, since they were meant to be isolated by Projectors.
