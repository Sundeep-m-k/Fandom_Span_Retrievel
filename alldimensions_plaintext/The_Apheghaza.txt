The Apheghaza, discovered inside of a quaternion dimension
The Apheghaza
(
penultimate hell, in Kaymizian
), is a type of hell, where the information making up a specific entity gets
affected
. The
deeper
one goes, the more
compressed
the being gets.
One can only be brought down here by the powers of deities above this reality, powers unconcieveable by anyone.
