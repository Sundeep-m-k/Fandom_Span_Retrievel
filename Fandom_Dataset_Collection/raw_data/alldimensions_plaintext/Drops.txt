About
[
]
Drops
are
universe
vatiants that are very weird and stupid. They just float around in
voids
of nothingness, while absorbing every kind of
matter
in their way.
Layers
[
]
The Drops have three layers of liquid in them. The first one consists of oil, the second one is made out of water, and mercury is the
substance
found in the third one.
These layers have no
verses
inside of them at all, but the thing is that they are rich in the aforementioned
materials
, which is why every greedy
creature
goes to collect resources from the Drops nonetheless.
Composition
[
]
The Drops are actually made out of
matot
particles
. But let's ignore that, shall we?
