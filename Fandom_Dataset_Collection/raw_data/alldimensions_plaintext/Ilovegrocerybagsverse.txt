Well look at that. We have found an object verse with an actual purpose.
This verse is used to store all the food you need. Many living things use this verse to store food that they can't find the space for.
This verse is also divided into sections, so each section can be used for a different verse to help you stay organized. This is because some of the stars exploded, but because of all the food inside at the time, it exploded in a 2D formula. Now it is divided into sections.
The problem with the verses getting more useful now is that they are now starting to lose their interestingness because of the fact that they aren't interestingly useless. However, even though we have lost one good aspect, we can still have other good aspects.
