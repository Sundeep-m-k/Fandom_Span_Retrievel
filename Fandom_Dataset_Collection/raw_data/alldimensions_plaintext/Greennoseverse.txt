The Green Void
The Greennoseverse is a verse similar to the
Bignoseverse
. However, it is green.
The Greennoseverse has only two guardians instead of 3 like the Bignoseverse has,
The first one is responsible for the core. It keeps it in shape and prevents the Greennoseverse from collapsing.
The second one is responsible for the crust. It keeps it smooth and nice to look at, and also makes it easy for the first one to do its job.
it's a pity that because of the properties of this nose, the time dimensions of the green void have become smeared and turned into porridge
Effects
[
]
This verse can make anything inside it green. That is why
The Green Void
is green. However, another barrier would stop these effects, since the rays only have two lives. Going through a barrier makes them lose a life, so only the green void is green and not
The Wall of the Black Void
.
