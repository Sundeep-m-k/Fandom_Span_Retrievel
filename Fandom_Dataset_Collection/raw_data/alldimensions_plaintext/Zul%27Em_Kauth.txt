Zul'Em Kauth (From Zul-Em-Kuuc,
Puffish
), is an odd being which when consuming matter, will transform it into cells to make it larger, starting off as an amoeba like singular eyed creature, a thin small humanoid creature, a powerful demon, and eventually a destroyer of planets, and beyond. This creature is what is known as a 'Demon', and they are mostly made of Demon Matter, with some amount of Zul'Em Matter (refer to
this page
) mixed in with it, and a little bit of
Primordium Delta
in each one of its cells. This creature can only be shrunken by being attacked by a god-level being using an energy blast, however, some amount of its being will seemingly always remain, even just 1 cell. It was a creation by
The Forgotten God
to help 'order' out the universe.
By its third stage, it will become nearly unstoppable, being able to use a variety of exotic forms of magic, including, but not limited to:
Disassembling and reassembling of body
Creating a
Primordium Sigma
barrier for short time
Powerful energy creation
Extension of limbs long distances
Short-Distanced teleportation
When in its fourth stage, it will be at demigod level power, able to have magic control much more powerful than
The Higher Ones
. From this point onward, it will only become more bigger and powerful, and no higher of a form.
