The
Nightmare Universe
is made up of
Hardcore Zyorons
, due to difference in size, entities inside
Nightmare Universe
will perceive
Hardcore Zyorons
as we perceive
Atoms
.
As name suggests, it is a living nightmare. The reason these verses have this name is because:
They have a pitch black color.
The creatures inside them which can cause
Daymares
(this phenomenon also exist inside the
Cherries
) take shape of the observer's worst nightmare.
The observer will slowly become trapped inside a
transcendium
liquid like substance, forcing them to face their worst nightmares
forever.
Do not enter these verses (or get outside of a
Hardcore Zyoron
in them) without a transcendium-repellent titanium suit with an endless supply of oxygen

(the gravity would crush you in 0.0000000000001 nanoseconds if you were not wearing a suit, and, of course, there is no oxygen). When covered with the transcendium substance, a person will slowly forget about their past life (The transcendium tends to go for the happy childhood memories first, then slowly progress through the memories until you can't remember who you are or what you are)

These universes are composed of literally nothing except
nightmarium
outside of their local Hardcore Zyorons, and will not show the person mercy until they can overcome their fears and learn that they are just fears, and then the
Transcendent Guardians
will let them go further. But
who knows
what's further...

Unless, of course, you are not oxygen-based, in that case either do not use any element if you can survive in a vacuum easily or just use an equivalent for other chemical based lifeforms.

May also only leave you with your worst memories such as traumatic experiences.
