About
[
]
The
Zertaverse rule
r is the
ruler
of many
Zertaverse
s, giving him the aforementioned (and very straightforward) name status.
Behavior
[
]
He's commonly seen destroying other
verses
, obviously avoiding the ones he rules over. Zertaverses inhabitants consider him a stupid tyrant that is focused on conquering more Zertaverses with the only purpose to gain status and power over his local
Barrel
.
He's so focused in that task he doesnt even bother to change his name to anything more original than the one he currently has.
Interesting Facts (Trivia)
[
]
His favorite food consists of a mix of 407
omniverses
, 2 peanut butter and tuna sandwiches that expired 13 centuries ago, with a side of 7up that you eat instead of drink. He calls it the 7omnipeunawich.
He considers that even a slight increase / decrease in the amount of omniverses used in the 7omnipeunawiches are going to ruin their flavor.
He considers the peanut butter and tuna sandwiches are extremly important despite those being infinitelly small compared to the omniverses used. He has even killed entities that disagreed with him over this. Or he just makes a version of the sandwiches and 7up the same size as the omniverses.
His voice is similar to BetterSam's text to speech
His
Interuniversal IP
is 57( Ôºõ¬¥–îÔΩÄ)d8.zerta.RRT).
He has the weird goal of being able to rule over a Zertaverse of, quote-unquote, "around (
Œ®
(
Œ©
œâ
)
(
100
465782
)
{\displaystyle \Psi (\Omega \omega )(100^{465782})}
Barckmann-howard ordinals and 45 mahlo cardinals{{;;;;;;}} (some googology thing)) LY in diameter". It doesn't make much sense when you realize that such a Zertaverse would be far larger than a Barrel, a
Box
or even beyond.
