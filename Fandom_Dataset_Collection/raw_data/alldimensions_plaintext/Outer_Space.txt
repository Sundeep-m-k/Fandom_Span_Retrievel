Introduction
[
]
The
Outer Space
is the area that can be found anywhere outside of
planets
,
stars
,
galaxies
and more, thus
we
are not living in Outer Space due to instead existing on
Earth
. You can find better things with using Telescope. If you go to outer space, you need an space clothing.
Location
[
]
Outer space is broadly defined as anywhere that's not within an atmosphere or any other solid
matter
. Officially, it begins at exactly 100
kilometres
above the
Earth
's sea level, though the exact boundary varies depending on which celestial body you are on. This is not yet an issue, due to humanity's lack of planetary colonisation.
Types
[
]
There are various different types of outer space, distinguished by how "outer" they are:
Thermosphere
[
]
The
thermosphere
is the part of the upper atmosphere that in in outer space. Nonetheless, it is still dense enough to provide significant drag on orbiting satellites necessitating their occasional boosting or eventual deorbiting. Since the lunar landings, no humans have left
Earth
's thermosphere.
Exosphere
[
]
The
exosphere
is the outer space containing gas molecules that are still gravitationally bound to their planet. Most celestial bodies have exospheres of some sort. Humans have never passed outside
Earth
's exosphere in the history of space exploration.
Interplanetary Medium
[
]
The
interplanetary medium
is the outer space between
planets
. It has about 10
7
particles per cubic metre, but this can increase to 10
9
during periods of high solar activity.
Interstellar Medium
[
]
The interstellar medium is the outer space between
stars
. It contains aboutÂ 10
6
particles per cubic metre.
Intergalactic Medium
[
]
The intergalactic medium is the outer space between
galaxies
. It is very tenuous, with about 10 to 100 particles per cubic metre depending on the precise location.
Voids
[
]
Voids
are the least dense region of outer space. They are absent of almost all matter, with less than one particle per cubic metre.
