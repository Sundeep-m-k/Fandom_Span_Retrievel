Ychievquurtixchra
, or
Yxchra
for short, is a god that rules over every verse below class 9. He is friends with
Chunky Cheese
since he helped him protect the
Xochaverse
, because when he first created the verse he was literally 4x as powerful as a
Guardian
. He currently lives inside a vast, dark dimension, where he creates and plans on verses. A notable example of one of his creations is the
Xochaverse
, which he currently thinks is the biggest verse he created.
