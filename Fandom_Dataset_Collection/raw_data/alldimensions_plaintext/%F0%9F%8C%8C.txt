ğŸŒŒ AKA
ChÃ³rosfinity
is the most mountrous pseudonumeroid that is way above not only this wiki, not only internet, but literally all, that is defined as:
A = every number or value from the entire existence and beyond it through all real, nonreal, positive or negative time summed and tetrated to itself infinitely. Includes fiction, metafiction, nonfiction, reality, superreality, etc. etc. etc.
A^^^16*((A^^^8)^A)^^2 = ğŸŒŒ (same formula as
ğŸ¦ 
but bigger basically)
Trivia
[
]
ğŸŒŒ shares the same properties as
ğŸ¦ 
and
ğŸ¦Ÿ
to not make it self destruct.
If more numbers or values in general are created in the entire existence, it WONT change ğŸŒŒ's value, since ğŸŒŒ is so powerful it already knows all the numbers that will ever be added in it before they even exist.
Any logic countering the absorption is countered by ğŸŒŒ back, meaning no number resists it.
Negative numbers / values get turned into positive for the calculation of ğŸŒŒ. Decimals get turned into numbers AT LEAST above 1. Example: 0,2 gets turned into 2, 0,13412134 gets turned into 1,3412134, etc.
Each value in general gets tetrated by the one bigger than it. Example: 1
7
213
1000
In fact,ğŸŒŒ is basically a buffed

and
ğŸ¦Ÿ
