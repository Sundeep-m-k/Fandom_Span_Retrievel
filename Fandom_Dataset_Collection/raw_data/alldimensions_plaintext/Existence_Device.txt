Description
[
]
An
Existence Device
is, like its name indicates, a device made by thousands of interversal organizations for the purpose of connecting
verses
with different
Existence Ranks
together for better transportation.
How to make one
[
]
1.Collect a few rare
materials
from multiple verses with different Existence Ranks. Note: Some of the best verses for this purpose are ones that transcend dimensionality, since it gives the materials in that verse many unique properties! For example,
Outerverses
.
2.Program an AI and teach it what an Existence Rank is and how to manipulate it. Note: Make sure the AI has a minimum IQ of 10^70!
3.Design a device with the materials and the AI.
4.Test the device 5-12 times.
5.Done.
How it works
[
]
1.Attach 2 or more versions of the device to random locations of the verses you want to connect.
2.Give all the versions of the device enough energy and computing power to handle all possible hazards such as
cosmic entities
trying to break it.
3.Done.
