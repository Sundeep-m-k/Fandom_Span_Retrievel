a god ( we are talking about the real God) is usually a divine being who creates their
universe
or
multiverse
if they have immense power, they're usually omniscient and omnipotent however there are gods who are elementary and are different elements(this is usually a common theme in polytheism but there are expections), and these beings are created by
the true creator
and also gods usually call themselves the alpha and the Omega but we all know they're just lying, gods are typically depicted as good, they also have their own domain outside of their universe(heaven) and they punish the wicked in a bad place(hell) these 2 realms usually make the afterlife.
