Most universes have a repulsive field around them, but if said universes are less than 42,000,000,000 light years in diameter, they're vulnerable to them.

Types of Sproyongs
[
]
Magnitude 1
[
]
These types are the most common at only 3 meters wide, however, they can damage any
verse
they collide with. These types will normally make breaks in space dust or even sometimes destroy small
planets
, but the damage is usually minimal.
Magnitude 2
[
]
These ones are less common than magnitude 1 ones, but they are more dangerous in exchange. They normally are 4 meters in diameter. These ones have a deadlier virus, so any star that it collides with will automatically go supernova due to the infection it gives. These ones also tend to last longer because they are more dense.
Magnitude 3
[
]
These are the ones where the damage is colossal. They are an average of 7 meters wide, but they can infect entire
galaxies
if they manage to touch them, and other galaxies in the
cluster
would almost certainly get infected as well. When a galaxy is infected, the temperature goes to a scorching hot temperature at about 70,000,000,000,000,000,000,000°C, so nothing in that galaxy could survive.
Magnitude 4
[
]
These are very rare with only one per 10^1,000,000,000 ly, and they are about 20 meters wide, however, any time it collides with an universe, the entire universe gets infected. This means the universe could completely be destroyed within 24 days. These Sproyongs are very feared, but collisions with universes are extraordinarily rare.
Magnitude 5
[
]
There are only 10,052 recorded magnitude 5 Sproyongs in history. These ones can get up to 50 meters in diameter, but when colliding with an universe, it not only infects the universe, but it makes it instantly let out a massive amount of energy which can infect nearby universes as well. These are catastrophic, normally claiming the lives of over 10,000,000,000,000,000
beings
. The minimum diameter of an universe for a collision like this happening is now 67 billion ly instead of 42 billion, making more universes vulnerable to them.
Magnitude 6
[
]
While a magnitude 6 Sproyong has only been recorded once at universe T16118, owned by
Terabithia
, it was 150m in diameter and had big crystals of green rock poking out of it. When a Magnitude 6 Sproyong hits an universe, the entire
multiverse cluster
gets infected and explodes, spewing out at least one new magnitude 6 Sproyong and lots of others smaller magnitude sproyongs.
Hypothetical Magnitude ω Sproyong
[
]
A magnitude ω Sproyong is the concept of the theorical limit an Sproyong can reach. Not even entire
Boxes
could be safe from a single magnitude ω Sproyong. It could start infecting all the Boxes' interiors, to a point they totally become corrupted and unstable, finally ending with said Boxes exploding. If they exist, they could create
Bxoes
which would promptly explode. These Sproyongs could only be controlled by entities above
Cetaverses
.
Appearance
[
]
A Sproyong simply looks like an
asteroid
that is flat-faced, with an average of 16 faces per Sproyong. These are grey in colour. The higher the magnitude, the denser the asteroid is, so higher magnitudes tend to be darker grey than lower ones, which are lighter grey.
The real "virus" parts of the Sproyong are the small parts around it, which let toxin out of them when colliding with a verse. These, in tiny amounts, are very powerful. They are green in colour and are mainly used as a murder weapon.
Origin of Sproyongs
[
]
Sproyongs first happened when a random
Inferno
universe suddenly got to an extremely hot temperature. No one knows why this suddenly happened, but all life in that universe suddenly died. When this happened, tiny chunks of rock came falling out of this universe, most of them only being a few meters wide.
These went out into different multiverses, each of them eventually causing drastic damage to these universes, all due to a sudden overheat from a random universe without a name.
Possible explanations for the heat
[
]
Here are some possible reasons for why this universe got to a sudden temperature.
Another extremely hot universe collided with it, which caused the universe to overheat.
A giant
star
suddenly exploded within it, filling the universe with heat.
The universe had a sudden increase in density.
A
black hole
caused space-time to slow down, making the universe hotter.
Many universes around this universe increased the heat.
The universe got close to the core of its local multiverse, which gave a lot of pressure to this verse, causing it to heat up.
There was a sudden outburst of antimatter, which collided with the matter in the verse, letting out a huge amount of energy and heat.
There were a ton of supernovas at once, which made all the heat from the supernovas multiply eachother, making the universe overheat due to the extremely high amount of supernovas there.
Some even suspect the
Devil
itself did this, but there is no proof.
First Ten Sproyongs

Sproyong
Magnitude
Description
EST-1
1
The first Sproyong ever recorded. This one was not very destructive, which smashed into the side of a universe and left a mark in a nebula.
EST-2
1
This one wasn't very destructive either, but it went through a black hole before it hit another nebula, which eliminated it.
TOAB-1
1
This one was not very destructive, but it actually went through two universes before getting destroyed. It left the cosmic web of one without doing damage, but then smashed into a galaxy on the other side.
MORYO-1
1
MORYO type Sproyongs are ones that go faster than the speed of sound. This one was the first MORYO type Sproyong that was recorded. It was not very destructive however, but it did destroy one small planet that didn't even have life.
EST-3
2
This was the first magnitude 2 Sproyong that was ever recorded, which made 4 stars in a universe go supernova. This destroyed a planet with single-cell life on it, and infected some other stars as well.
EST-4
1
Another Sproyong that didn't do much damage besides leave some infection marks on some nebulae.
MORYO-2
1
The second recorded MORYO type Sproyong, this one destroyed a planet with no life, but strangely did not infect anything else.
EST-5
1
This one smashed into the cosmic web of another universe which did nothing but leave minor infection marks on two nebulae.
EST-6
1
This one destroyed two planets in the same
solar system
and left some marks on a galaxy arm.
ZOJ-1
1
This one destroyed a planet in a solar system, but strangely left the core of it floating in space.
