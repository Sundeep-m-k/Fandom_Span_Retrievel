Second Realm Creature
A Lmnicopti is a strange amalgamation present only in the
Second Realm
.
Appearance
[
]
Lmnicopti will usually assume the look of a white-colored, non-Euclidean triangle. Attempting to shine light onto a Lmnicopti will only result in the light being directed in every direction, making taking an image of a Lmnicopti very hard. Creatures have used other ways to take an "image" of a Lmnicopti, although they are extremely advanced.
Contents/Structure
[
]
As no creature has physically touched a Lmnicopti (it might even be impossible), no creature from the First Realm knows what a Lmnicopti contains or what it is made out of.
Abilities

Lmnicopti are weirdly intelligent, although it cannot be understood very well. Lmnicopti have engaged in conversations with First Realm creatures before, although very little information was recovered due to supposed language being indecipherable. Almost all audio logs of a Lmnicopti "talking" to a First Realm creature have classified, although a handful have been leaked.
Here is an audio log leaked in 1425

, with the text translated into English. The Lmnicopti's speaking has been roughly transliterated into English.
First Realm Creature
"Wait! I see it! It's that... triangle-shaped thing!

On very rare occasions, Lmnicopti have engaged in fights with First Realm creatures. In all recorded cases, the Lmnicopti trapped its attackers in a bubble-like structure and "popped" it, making the bubble and all things inside of it disappear. It is unknown where the bubble or its contents go to.
