The
Bins
are
verses
even larger than
the Coins
and the
Wallet
, and they can do anything. They're like the
Boxes
, since they pretty much the equivalents of those for the Coins, but since they're not inside them, they don't even have stable
time
, so sometimes they will randomly lose or gain a Coin or go back in time.
The Bins
are just containers full of all of these different Coins with different time schedules. The Bins themselves cannot control time, but their Coins can. If a Bin runs out of Coins due to its properties it will freeze in time, but this also means they simply can't stop existing as their lifetime gets paused, unless new Coins are put inside them. Though, this also means a Bin with too much Coins can randomly start aging really fast, to the point it gets erased way faster than it normally would.
