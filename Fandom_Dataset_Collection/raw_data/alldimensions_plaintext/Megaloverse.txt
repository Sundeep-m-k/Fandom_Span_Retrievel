Potentially a googolduplexth of Structures, however, this is unknown, as most sizes of verses beyond this are.
The
Megaloverse
is a type of verse that contains an unimaginable amount of
Structures Of Everything
, all set up in different ways. Our own
Ampliusverse
resides in this type of verse as well.
The idea that other Structures are cubes is unknown, so the depiction is just the best guess of those who have researched the topic. It is likely that with the number of Structures in the Megaloverse, one of them is identical to ours, but when you realize that the structures may not be limited to our known dimensions, the idea becomes much less likely.
