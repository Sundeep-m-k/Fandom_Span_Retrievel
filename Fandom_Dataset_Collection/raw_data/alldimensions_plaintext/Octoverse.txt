About the Octoverse
[
]
Basic
[
]
The Octoverse is a verse located in the
Yottaverse
. The verse itself has three main lifeforms: squids, octopuses, and octosquids, those are making the verse pretty alive and cool looking, the squids and octopuses are pretty much like earth squids and octopuses, but there's an octosquid, by the name you know it's a squid and octopus merged together, that we call the "octosquid".
Creatures

Ruler of the Octoverse

Lord Octo, is the ruler of the octoverse, is actually instead of a rude and remorsless god, a very nice god! He happily accepts anyone that comes to his verse if they do not break the rules.
Superclusters
[
]
There are 4 main superclusters: Ocus, Squtter, haiju and yipjeil, when you enter the verse, you are located in the ocus supercluster; this is one of the biggest ones there are.

[
]
The Yipjeil super cluster is the smallest of them all, with a size of just 43 quadrillion and is located in south north. (wait what)
Systems
[
]
There are two systems, you might be asking, "wtf, this verse is huge how only two" those systems are huge, the orbit of the longest star for comparision, Iptulucotus takes 89 Quintillion light years, and the verse is just 8 nonillion light years, a half of the verse is that orbit, now you can see why.
Octoplex system
[
]
Octoplex
[
]
The octoplex star, is the 2nd smallest star in the verse, and Lord octo lives here and creates here most things, this star has most life than any other star, and 4 different panets orbit it (like our solar system), its yellowish bluish.
Octoplex planets
[
]
Octas
[
]
The Octas star is the biggest of all the planets, some octopuses and octosquids live there, its kinda greenish purplish like manta.
Squidiporius
[
]
Squidiporius is the 3rd smallest planet and actually some squids live there, squids are friends with octopuses but they also dont believe in lord octo and stuff, its the brightest planet in there, but squids dont see a difference between light and dark.
Oscasserfilouptis
[
]
Oscasserfilouptis is the smallest planet in the octoplex system, and is the most dead, some squids and octosquids (rarely octopuses) come there and explore it like mars, they can also live there, unlike on our planet mars, also it is the longest planet name in the whole verse, its reddish colored.
Iptulucotus
[
]
iptulucotus is the 2nd biggest planet and most octosquids live there, they are friends too and some believe in octopuses religion, the planet is very big and massive, it is purplush bluish like colored.
Tracupurtus system
[
]
The tracupurtus system has 3 planets only, and is far from being like octoplex system, there are a little octopuses doing research there, but not much.
Tracupurtus
[
]
This is the largest star in the verse, its also yellowish and is very very cold, infact that octopuses didnt even still found a way to test there.
Yackcaccs
[
]
Yackcaccs, is the smallest planet from all of the 3, and is completely dead, its a bright planet but not the brightest.
Tripolosaé
[
]
tripolosaé, is a planet that is 2nd smallest, and is very dead too, that planet colored like reddish salmon, its the most colorful planet in the verse also.
Urcutürus
[
]
Urcuturüs, is the biggest planet of all of the planets in the verse, also its not so colorful; black and yellow to compare, there are little life there that is still unknown, but octopuses and squids (also octosquids) are researching those little creatures, so they will find what are those creatures soon!

Octoauripax
[
]
The galaxy is named "octoauripax", and is very big, infact the biggest in whole universes!!! it contains all the systems, stars, and planets, its named after lord octo father "Octoauripax", the galaxy is very old and big, its so big infact two of those can break the octoverse, the verse doesnt die anyways, so its just for fun.
Laws and reality
[
]
The laws in that verse are pretty simple:
Law 1: Gravity is so low so you can only space swim and cannot walk or jump.
Law 2: Reality can be whatever Lord Octo decides it be.
Law 3: Another verse like that cant be copied through a
verse copying machine
simply because its too big.
Law 4: Everyone who enters knows that they cant come back.
all laws were written in the
Octo bible
by Lord Octo.
Creature-made Things
[
]
Religions
[
]
Relligions are in this verse too, like squids believe in squidopors and more..
Octoism
[
]
Octoism is a relligion that is believee by most life in theOoctoverse, mostly octopuses believe in that religion, but more do, they believe in "Lord octo",whicht is actually a real thin. Those, who believe in him can see hi; those, who dn'tt dont,Llord octo is known for creating the whole verse and creating the system "
Octoplex
", he is the strongest god of all of them in the religions and is actually very nice and grateful.
Squidaism
[
]
Squidaism is a religion believed by most squids and it actually has a god too; his name is squidopors, and he's actually real and he is nice for squids but not for other., he is known for creating the system"tracupurtus"
tracupurtu
and is sometimes not that bad of a god; he's actually nice sometimes to others if they don't give any threat to the verse.
Octosicoism
[
]
Octosicoism is a relligion believed by all octosquid., if they believe in other religions, its said in the "
Octo bible
" this "nor you sin anyone or sin yourself, but you can sin to the death of a person betraying your sin"
ℵ
{\displaystyle \aleph}
, that means you can believe in other religions, but if someone betrays your religion, he should DIE. original letters: "the sinner of the betrayer of the sin is not the betrayer himself; it's the path", you can believe in other religions as an octosquid, but dont betray your religion.
Noanaism
[
]
Nonaism is a relligion believed by some octopuse.,Its has no god inthe religion; in,fact,t they believe in na object called "the octo traniyzi." It'ts not n octopus- made object nora naturall object, they believe "outaps" created it and they say everyone who touches it salld die, this is true for some and some say its absolutely nothing, they sa,y "if you do it you dont stupid", do you believe in a side or not even in any side?
Atheist
[
]
This is actually a real relligion, its just means you dont believe in anything, 0.27683322% of the verse population believes in this religion (makes no sense they believe in something while they dont believe in anything).
Language
[
]
In the octoverse, they speak one language, its called "octoish" its a ultra easy to learn language, ;ou can also learn it yourself.

Events
[
]
The Octo war for freedom
[
]
The octo war for freedom started because of squids making octopuses not free, you may ask "but theyre friends arent they? :(" and i dont blame you, they are friends, but they werent always, the squids always attacked octopuses and made them locked, the octopuses wanted revenge and freedom, then a war has been started, the octopuses at end won, but they became quickly after.
Anti-Racism For octosquids
[
]
There have been lately racism gangs about octosquids, they said that octosquids are idiots, trashes, and stupids, those were obvisously the squids, as they wanted revenge for the octopuses winning the war, the octopuses said that if they are being racist to their friends, they will be racist to them too, Lord octo liked this idea and gave them one of his angels "Ooc" he boostened their confidence and they talked trash to the squids, this war of racism for octosquids isnt over yet, and wont be anytime soon.
Great Gift From lord octo :)
[
]
Lord octo hated racist squids, he gave them a "gift", it were a giant ultra meteor, a lot of squids panicked, and then one old octopus said: "Stop, STOP, please, ugh WHY CANT WE JUST BE FRIENDS? DO YOU WANNA BE ENEMIES?" everyone agreed with him, even Lord octo, so he stopped the meteor attack, and thats a over for the racism for octosquids, still there are a few gangs that are racist, lord octo decided and writen it in the
octo bible
: "the gangs of the racisters, are the horrible sinners of destruction, they should burn in HELL.
History
[
]
The Big Bangocto

]
After 6.2 Quattuordecillion yrs, a small object that lord octo saw, begon to spread across all the verse, apparently it was called "life", then soon enough planets and stars were created, Soon life were created!

]
Soon the life developed languages, relligions, and even mutations! the life began to grow and create new stuff, soon enough the verse was full of life!
Today
