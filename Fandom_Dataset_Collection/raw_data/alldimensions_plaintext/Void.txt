Voids
are regions of space that contain either very little or no matter whatsoever. Sometimes, voids contain no matter that is deemed as important or elementary enough, whilst containing many other things. In this case, if generally agreed, the region of space will still be called a void, but only in a specific aspect. For example, the interstellar void of our
Universe
is devoid of matter, but filled with energy, photons, neutrinos, dark matter, virtual particles and more, yet it is universally accepted as being a void.

Pseudo-voids
[
]
Pseudo-voids aren't what would usually fall under the definition of a void. They are regions of space completely devoid of at least one particle natural to their parent verse(such as
Universes
,
Multiverses
, etc). Particle, in this sense, refers to any naturally constructed element that arises from the laws that govern the specific region space.
Under this defintion, the vast majority of all regions of space are pseudo-voids, which is why they aren't usually even called voids.
Normal voids
[
]
A normal void is a pseudo-void for multiple large-encompassing categories of particles. It is also custom for a general consensus that an area be a void, for it to be a normal void. In this scenario, intergalactic space of our Universe is a normal void, or just a void, as it lacks atoms, molecules and generally just large solid structures.
Le Jorino Areas
[
]
Le Jorino areas are spaces inbetween verses. In most cases, a good fraction of the area is a true void with an ever-shifting shape, then becoming a normal void as one hits the border of the verse. If the containing body that the area belongs to is one with a higher amount of matter than empty space, the area will be at most a pseudo-void.
The Outside
[
]
The Outside is mostly completely empty, only filled with certain
non-existent
objects and wandering verses. Aside from those, there are basically no forces and no matter, making it a very fine and pure true void.
True voids
[
]
True voids are voids completely devoid of any matter. These voids are still susceptible to being affected by fields, forces, laws and many others. These voids usually occur either on extremely microscopic levels or in infinitely sized regions inbetween verses.
Types of true voids include:
Supertrue voids - true voids that aren't affected by fields of forces. The regions appear side-by-side with normal true voids.
Hypertrue voids - supertrue voids that aren't susceptible to being affected in any future finite time, asuming that the enclosed containing body bounded by the sphere of influence of its
laws
is not affected by anything outside of it. These voids are extremely rare and usually only occur in extremely tiny empty verses.
Absolute voids
[
]
Absolute voids are a theoretical type of void that aren't a part of anything whatsoever. Not influenced by any laws, not susceptible to any alterations, not affected by any
Realm
, they are completely and utterly seperate from everything, located in itself
The Absolute void is where someone manages to escape everything and if the person who escaped everything tries to escape the void he will keep travelling infinitely and even if god himself tries to escape the void he too will keep travelling forever also if the void had humanoid form and used his true potential everything will just cease to exist and when i say everything nothing itself will somehow cease to exist and nonexistent things also somehow manage to cease to exist by the voids true potential yes u read that right nonexistent things and I mean completely nonexistent things somehow cease to exist by the voids inner presence also remember this is most likely just the potential he can use. But theres a sad part the voids full potential can never be reached as his full potential is so large that  no one not even the void himself can describe something close to that number yes an all knowing being cant even describe anything close to that number / his own potential and despite the void being able to do whatever he wants there is one thing he cannot do which is to somehow describe a fraction of his potential or even come close to comprehending a fraction of his own potential and just so u know whatever i said will never be close to the smallest fraction of the voids potential as even the smallest fraction of his potential is just too large for anyone to ever describe including the void himself (the voids potential is beyond anything and everything)
No such voids have ever been found.
Semi-absolute voids
[
]
Semi-absolute voids are voids that have most of the conditions to be an absolute void met, but are not exactly an absolute void. (e.g. being contained by something, having size). These are surprisingly common and have been found in
cetaverses.
