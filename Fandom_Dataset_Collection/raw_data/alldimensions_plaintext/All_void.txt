An
All void
, also known as omni-voids or omega voids is a type of void where regular particles can only exist for roughly a single
voidsecond
. They're sometimes considered their own separate plane of existence and non-existence.

voidal Ripples
[
]
Their presence can be detected in the form of voidal ripples, which are not mere distortions, but glimpses of energy being sucked in and released as
voidionized particles
. This presence can be even detected at the edges of a
wikiverse
, and possibly
even beyond that
.
Entering an All void
[
]
Entering an
All void
is extremely hard despite them being Nigh-Omnipresent. Escaping them is even harder, though.
Method 1
[
]
open a rift to an
All void
by bubiling up
Voidionized particles
.
Method 2
[
]
Destroy all of their local existence and non-existence. Thats cruel.
Structures in an All void
[
]
Despite nothing being in the
All voids
, they also contain a few things at the same time which exist in a state similar to a superposition. These structures are only found in denser pockets of
VoidIonized particles
, though.
Some of these things are:
Voidionized particles
(most common)
Voidal pockets
(Even denser pockets of voidIonized particles to the point that they can be considered their own structures.)
Rogue archverses
(voidionized) (rarest)
The imaginary edges
[
]
While the
All voids
don't really have an edge or barriers, they do at the same time, as these exist in a lower and higher dimension at the same time which is really confusing.
The covoidal reset
[
]
The covoidal reset is an event that will happen if an
All void
has consumed all of existence and non-existence. This event is extremely unlikely to ever happen even with infinite time or beyond infinite time.
Phases of an covoidal reset are:
Phase 1 (equalization)
[
]
First, all mater in that
All void
will expand by 28.00985%, because it has entered a new equalization phase.
Phase 2 (evaporation and Harmonization)
[
]
If all matter has expanded by a certain point which is possibly 28.00985%, all matter will start to evaporate and harmonize with that
All void
's properties.
Phase 3 (de-existence age)
[
]
Now all matter has evaporated in
Voidionized particles
.
Phase 4 (healing process)
[
]
After 4750^1800000000000000000
OYC
everything in that
All void
starts to heal again, slowly separating from it to repeat the process.
