The Poorly Misplaced Junkverse (PMJ) is the same as the
Junkverse
, but poorly misplaced. It was misplaced as the result of an accident that happened during the time when someone came and jacked an axe at it to try to grab some of the junk, but it resulted in the Poorly Misplaced Junkverse becoming poorly misplaced, hence its name.
