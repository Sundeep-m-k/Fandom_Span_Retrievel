The
Unnamed Hierarchy
is a hierarchy that spans a total of 81 verses. Each verse holds exactly 1,000,000 of the previous verses and are named after a roman numeral. They have various effects as seen below. They are also part of the larger
Official Hierarchy

Properties
Explanation
I
[
]
I is by far the most important part of the hierarchy: it constantly creates
Yoolith
in its core. It is the only way for expansion to occur. I shares the property with all unnamed hierarchy verses of splitting into two when completely full.
II-LXXXI
[
]
The rest of the verses follow this same pattern. When an LXXXI is completely full, it will deposit all of it's LXXXs into the local
Unnamedverse
and fade away, leaving a True I behind. This pattern repeats until the
Unnamedverse
is full.
Every verse in the hierarchy (Other than LXXXI) has two types: A normal and a “True” verse. Normal verses have the splitting property, while “True” verses will turn into the next type of verse, while also creating a copy. A single LXXXI can only have one “True” verse at a time, and that will be of the highest reached verse.
