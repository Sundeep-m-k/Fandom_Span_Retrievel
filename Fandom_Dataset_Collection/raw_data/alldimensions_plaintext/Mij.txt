Mij was a Lower Jimmid who was noted as the most influential of their kind before the first purge of life committed by Jim. Although Mij had attempted to create their own life and chain of verses at some point, they failed at this spectacularly (both the life itself and Mij). Eventually, Mij went through a long period of violence due to her frustration with the verses' failures at producing life, killing thousands of Lower Jimmids in her rage.
Soon though, Mij was exiled by Jim and a league of other Jimmids in cahoots with them. Soon after, Mij had disappeared and was unable to be seen anywhere near Jim's little bubble. The tale of the battle leading up to Mij's defeat is reportedly quite plain, as it was, in simple words, and absolute stomp due to numbers and Jim's accumulated skill as a general and fighter.

Mij was described as a sibling-like rival, who had a personality similar to Jim's before her bout of rage.
