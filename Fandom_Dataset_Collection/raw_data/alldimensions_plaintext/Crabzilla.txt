About
[
]
Crabzilla
is a Crab-like
cosmic entity
that is known to have destroyed entire
planets
and
solar systems
. It has also ruled over entire
civilizations
and is worshiped as their
god
.
It is surprisingly young for its role, though, being only 8 billion years old, which makes it quite younger than some
Universes
.
It is so strong that it can jump and propel itself in order to reach speeds that allow it to travel through several solar systems within seconds. Still, usually it just teleports instead, which enables it to travel between
universes
with ease.
It can also shoot powerful, destructive
toxicium
lasers from its claws as a direct combat ability. He can make shockwaves with his screams if he wants to. He can also trample absolutely anything to death, but the ability is limited by the small feet it has. It is also practically resistant to everything and anything used to try and destroy it, such as
corruptite
blasters.
Origin
[
]
Crabzilla originated from
quantum foam
. We don't know why such a thing happened, but it was most likely an event that took place just by random chance.
He isn't made out of
atoms
, instead being composed by nuclei arranged in a
cube
order, with a soup of
electrons
around them, just like
black dwarfs
. We know this because, like all crabs, he has to moult his exoskeleton, which is strong even before such process is executed.
Other names
[
]
Because of his role, he has been known by many names, such as:
The Destroyer of Worlds
The Crab Terror
The Tyrannical Crab
Etc.
Greater Crabs
[
]
There are also Greater Crabs, which are manually generated by
Crabzilla
(by coming out of his mouth like he is vomiting for some reason) and seem to act as his minions. They look just like ordinary crabs(except for their unscrupulous size) and act like them too. These range from slightly larger than average crabs to ones the size of an average
Earth
's tree.
Greater Crab powers
[
]
The stronger ones are capable of terraforming entire
planets
and
stars
by ripping them to pieces and reassembling them with their claws. This means they can also resist extreme temperatures, needing several tens of millions of degrees Celsius to be affected. This means that not even the core of most stars is enough to burn them.
