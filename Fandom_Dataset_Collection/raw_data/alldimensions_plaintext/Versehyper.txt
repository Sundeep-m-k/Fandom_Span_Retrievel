Versehypers
are a type of simulated objects found inside
Versexenos
, so they can be thought of as the opposite of the
Hyperverses
. They're pretty much caves made of
Glitchonicite
and not much else. They contain very small simulated entities known as
Another Doggies
, which can generate up to 3 or 4
Repyhpuppies
each that are VERY ANNOYING.
Structure
[
]
The Versehypers are mostly just a bath of
Verseomnis
,
Glitchonicite
, and styrofoam. However, they are arranged in a perfect Sierpinski triangle packing. Reality extrudes into a Versehyper, and you could easily exit the local
Versemeta
if you're not careful (as Verseomnis reconnects the real negative verses with the fictional ones).
