Le Jorino
areas are the areas where there are almost no verses. These areas are formed by gravity of verses. Le Jorino areas are some kind of "verse" counterpart to the void between
galaxies
and
higher levels
in our universe.
Levels
[
]
There are various levels of Le Jorino areas. The level of a Le Jorino area is calculated by the
EUSI
of the biggest verse/object inside the verse/object where the Le Jorino area is contained, where a universe, or a verse that directly contains galaxies, has 1 on the EUSI scale. Example, a Le Jorino area in a
Multiverse
would be a level 1 Le Jorino area, and the void between galaxies would, on some definitions, be a level 0 Le Jorino area.
