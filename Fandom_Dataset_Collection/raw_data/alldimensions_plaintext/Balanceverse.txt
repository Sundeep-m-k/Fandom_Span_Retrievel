we know this because something is odd.. but its not hd'ed so we cant see exactly what is it.
well, we saw something in the camera and we think its more than just "nothing" straight up, so please be patient we are working on this to see whats the other thing.
well, WE didnt create it,
HIM
created it of course, so we still wondering what is it.
we dk, HIM created him of course.
we saw a odd, red, shaped like object, we still developing better stuff to see what is it, someday we could!

it been a long day.. when theia didnt even hit earth, when THE UNIVERSE wasnt even created.. light passed by dark, light hitted him by accident, dark tought it was not a accident and he did it to annoy him, light started then conquering the universes, but dark knew it would destroy the entire space and started attacking light, light was very confused, then light attacked back, it was a harsh fight, at the end dark won, and saved the world.
explained
The dark won, saving the universe.
short answer: yes, dark was still before stronger than light, but now dark is chillin' in tv doin' nothin' (ok ill stop the slang) while Light is developing to be stronger, yes, he is stronger but hes still getting stronger and stronger while training!
Before was: dark Nowadays: light.
explained
Dark saved the universe by conquering it: if light would won it will destroy
yin and yang
and that will destroy life, you, and me. while when dark won, he conquered MOST of the universe (MOST, Not all.) and by that he saved the universe.
