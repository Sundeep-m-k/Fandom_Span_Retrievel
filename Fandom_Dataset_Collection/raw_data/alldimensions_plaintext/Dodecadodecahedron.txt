A
dodecadodecahedron
is one of the uniform polyhedra. It may be considered to exist either in Euclidean space, with pentagonal and pentagrammatic faces, or in a 2-D hyperbolic space with purely pentagonal faces. Due to the nature of the dodecadodecahedron, both interpretations are topologically the same.
