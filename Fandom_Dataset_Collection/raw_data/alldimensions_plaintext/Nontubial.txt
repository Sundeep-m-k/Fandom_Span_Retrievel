In question: is it really a tube, or not? Tubular topology here, is alienated at this scale. The mystery of infinitary negativity.
Nontubial
("nontubular") are metaphysical fields which the topology is sometimes polar for the majority. As unknown, the polar is actually nonpolar, as dimensions are distorted by infinitary subabstraction.

Trijective Signs
[
]
Trijective signs, or a ternary sequence of -s, +s, and 0s; are considered operators. By infinite abstraction, these operators combine and cancel each other for predicates, sometimes infinitary, binary, or something else. At high presence of 0s, they define "values."
Centers
[
]
There are actually many centers in a Nontubial, describing "signless values" in a random sub-abstraction logic. Due to this way, integers and
supercontainments
are considered impossible here. As it gets closer, the topology starts to be more polar. These integers are expressed with really long equations with bijective signs cancelling each other.
Centers are the places which particles abject the most, hence they hold values. Due to polar topology, regions nearest the center are nontubodynamic voids, which signs are absent. There's a technique that equations could change the signs and be transmitted into another center; which is why sequences inbetween work together for bijective signs.
Nontubodynamics
[
]
Equations are already found in nontubodynamics, which hold topological loops to all dimensions and their extents. The smallest examples, only hold bijective signs as operators, and are concentrated to form their topologies. There are infinite sets of bijective signs, but they are random at place.
There are other equations which defining unknown topologies, such that periodic values jump to others. However, they are infinitely chaotic, so they jump in a random way outside of polar centers. Abstract signs, are known to build Nontubial entirely, and hold non-tubodynamic equations defining themselves and direction. These are factorized with other signs being as operators. Bijective signs define topology.
Some studies managed to create advanced patternic loops with some signs being used as operators, along with abstracted multiplication and factorization. Some examples are things that seem to loop that is also moving in a loop. This is mandatory, as looping is already distorted; and has a high chance of getting interacted. As suggested, they hold simplest predicates.
Particles
[
]
Particles in Nontubials are metastable if they hold non-random equations in nontubodynamics, and we'll only describe some of them.
Zerons
[
]
Zerons
are the smallest-possible Xi particles found in the Nontubials. They hold the true value of "zero," as signless and their extents. They can self-merge with zeroic energy, emitting another energy out as "net-zero."
Hyperzerons are another particle found in a Nontubial, in which hold bijective signs in entanglement; that represent signless and hyperzeroes. Zeroic energy can barely interact with Hyperzerons in place.
