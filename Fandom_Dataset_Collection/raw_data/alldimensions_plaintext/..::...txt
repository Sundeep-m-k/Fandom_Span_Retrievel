About
[
]
This verse is a container of many different verses, that mostly look the same because they are all copies of each other, in which something else happened, even on subatomic scales, making this verse absolutely huge, not to mention that it is throughout all different times.
Life
[
]
There is virtually no life in ..::.. . All of the extremely rare and isolated life either hides in the spaces between the Structural Defiers, or live all the way at the edge of ..::.. . They are quite advanced and get their energy from Structural Defiers. Most of the time, they don't take a lot of energy, due to fear of being discovered by other creatures and being destroyed.
Structure
[
]
Each one of the triangles in the picture holds one Structural Defier. The entire ..::.. is actually a huge fractal made up of triangular shapes. The center holds... nothing that special. It just holds another Structural Defier.
