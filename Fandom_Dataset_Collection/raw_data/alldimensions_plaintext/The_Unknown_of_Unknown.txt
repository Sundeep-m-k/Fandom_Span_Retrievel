The
Unknown of Unknown
is a verse that we know almost nothing about, and is the last of the Unknowns. All next verses do not have the properties of the Unknown of Unknown that make it so difficult to know information about. We know so little about it that we only really know what it contains, have some educated guesses of what it looks like, and one fact:
Literally all things will loop back to the unknown of unknown if they try to leave, even using extending reversed quantum tunneling. The only (known) way to escape is to increase your
Existence Rank
enough to surpass.
It is contained by
The Infinite Colors
, and is made up of
the absolute infinity of unknown
. It looks like a completely black void, and if an object moves more than
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
meters away it will be completely impossible to see (although some other types of communication signals can still communicate with it).
Neighborverses
[
]
Sometimes people have come across the
Neighborverse
while traveling or attempting to leave the Unknown of Unknown. It is impossible to leave the area once the Neighborverse is in detectable range and the Neighborverse must be entered first to be able to leave (although leaving transports you to the
Neighborhood
and not the Unknown of Unknown).
