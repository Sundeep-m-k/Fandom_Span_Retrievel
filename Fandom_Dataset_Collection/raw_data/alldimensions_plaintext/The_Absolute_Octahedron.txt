The
Absolute Octahedron
is an extremely large octahedron that keeps
The Absolute Cube
stable. It has a gap between it and The Absolute Cube, which is filled with
Absolute Darks
.
The Absolute Octahedron contains many
Absolute Balances
inside it, creating a balanced color, but because of the Absolute Darks, its surface does not have just a single, solid color.
Properties
[

Other than holding up Absolute Cubes and containing Absolute Balances, The Absolute Octahedron does not have many interesting properties. Coincidentally, its surface is also partly made of
Shrekium
, although the reason why is unknown.
