The
Moon
, also known as Luna, is a
moon
of
Earth
. It is the 5th largest one in the
solar system
, and the 2nd largest relative to its
planet
(only behind
Charon
and
Pluto
).
It is tidally locked to Earth, which means that it's only possible to see one side of the Moon from Earth. The Moon is very cratered due to meteor impacts since it doesn't have an atmosphere

Human arrival

humans
