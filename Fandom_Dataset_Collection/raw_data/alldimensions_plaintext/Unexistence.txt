Unexistence
is the extremely strange thing that lies beyond
The Far
.
Unexistence is at a strange point in the hierarchy, containing a verse
with an ill-defined size
, and being contained by a ridiculously huge complex. That has caused existence and reality at this point
to begin to break down.
That makes the Unexistence "not exist", hence the name. The picture only shows a wormhole to Unexistence, because an actual image of Unexistence
would be impossible.
Only a few creatures have ever been to Unexistence. All
never came back,
most likely due to the space inside Unexistence having no "existence coordinates" , which basically tell where, when, why, and how a place exists within the cosmos. Since Unexistence doesn't have any existence coordinates, it can basically erase any creatures out of existence
if they enter it
.
It is unknown what lies inside of
Unexistence
except for at least one
Far
.
Other than our Local Unexistence, there are many more such anomalies scattered everywhere throughout the hierarchy.
