The Hexagonal Void
If you somehow manage to find an exit from
The Hexagonal Void
, static will (WON'T) appear in your vision, along with text on your screen that will randomize every split second. It can say between "DON'T GO BACK", "YOU SHALL PASS", "THIS IS FINITE", "WE WILL HELP YOU ESCAPE THIS REALITY". If you finally get through the exit, text will change in order: "NICE JOB", "I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE", "IT IS... NOT ALL YOUR FAULT", "NOW YOU WILL ESCAPE FOREVER". After the last text fades away, you will be flung home where you truly can back in here. This is the main habit of
He
. So if you manage to enter this bend of reality,
He
will find and help you get out of here.
APPEARANCE
[
]
Pollution
, despite being infinite, appears to be a glitchy (or incubated) realm that changes every less than 25 miliseconds. If you try to move, you will almost instantaneously be teleported to where you last been before you moved. The teleportation delay is less than 1e-1000 miliseconds.
RECORDED FOOTAGE

This is recorded footage of Alex and Sim entering Pollution:
Alex: Wait... We found an exit!
Sim: Let's go! We're out of here!
(10^20 light years away from the exit)
Sim: Why am I (NOT) seeing static and text on my screen?
Alex: You are not (ALWAYS) the only one Sim.
Sim: Let's not bother it.
(110 light years away from the exit)
Alex: We are almost there!
Sim: Keep going!
(at the exit, where Alex and Sim are both at the end of Pollution)
Alex and Sim: OHH MY GOD!
Sim: What just happened?
Alex: I don't know but let's keep going.
Sim: Uh?
Alex: Were home. We can- wait... WHAT IS THAT?
Sim: IT'S OUR HOME! FINALLY!
