An infinite amount of, philosophical, logical, illogical, possible, impossible, mathematical, endless, end-able, meta-physical, ontological, cosmological, meta-logical, frameworks of sets of everything. It essentially contains every single verse and any future verses that’s ever conceived, imagined, thought of, spoken of, drawn, and so on. Each one of them with infinitely changing possibilities. The

The Allsphere is the collection of every single universe, multiverse, megaverse, dimension (alternate or pocket), and realm. This includes not only Marvel Comics, but also DC Comics, Image, Dark Horse, Wildstorm, Archie, Harvey, Shueisha, Boom Studios, Rebellion, Dynamite, IDW, Graphic India, Derby Pop, Vertigo, Oni Press, Udon, Valiant, Kodansha, Shogakukan, and every universe ever mentioned or seen (and an infinite amount never mentioned or seen) including our
own world
. Everything is in the Allsphere, and there is only “one” Allsphere. It includes every single literary work, television show, movie, urban legend, universe, realm, etc. ever. It includes everyone from Popeye to Rocky Balboa to Ronald Reagan to Romeo and Juliet to Luke Skywalker to Snoopy to Jay and Silent Bob, etc. This also includes universes outside of American and European western comics, such as Dragon Ball, Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Ghost in the Shell, My Hero Academia, Sailor Moon, and etc. The Allsphere is EVERY reality, including those published by all other companies. Even fan-fictions, cancelled works, mere fantasies, wishes of thoughts created by people, future comic book publishing companies, non-fictional things, real-world entities, and fictional universes yet to be published are considered part of the Allsphere; simply put, the Allsphere is every version of reality and existence imaginable and unimaginable. Even
existence
and
non-existence
.
Picture everything you know, then everything you do not know, then everything you cannot even conceive of. This is the Allsphere. It is the totality of everything, yet it defies being just “everything” because even the concept of everything is contained within it.
Beyond the hierarchies and Trees lies the concept of "other things." But what does "other" mean in the context of the Allsphere? It’s not just the inclusion of everything you can imagine, it’s the inclusion of everything you can’t. Every cancelled dream, every forgotten idea, every unwritten story, every thought. it’s all there. Fiction and reality blur together, becoming indistinguishable. What you think of as imaginary is no less real than the ground beneath your feet. Even the idea of "real" itself folds into the Allsphere.  It isn’t merely “everything” because “everything” is far too small of a concept to describe it. It’s not a collection, not an amalgamation, not a whole, because all of those imply something finite, something that could one day be measured or understood. The Allsphere is the thing that holds these ideas.
Now, consider the spaces between these hierarchies. The “gaps” between realities are not empty. They are teeming with potential, with non-existence that vibrates with the energy of what could be. And then there is
time
. In the Allsphere, time is not a river or a line or even a looping cycle. Time in the Allsphere is a field, a shifting, breathing entity that exists all at once and never at all. Every timeline, every possibility, every fragment of what could be considered “before” or “after” exists together in a way so intricate it becomes chaos. There are timelines that flow backward, timelines that split into countless others, timelines that collapse into singularities only to explode outward into infinite strands. And all of these timelines are tied together, not by causality, but by something deeper. Far, far deeper.
Snoopy dreams atop his doghouse in the same Allsphere where cosmic titans wage war for control of existence. Jay and Silent Bob crack jokes in universes where Thanos and Darkseid scheme their next move.
It is the singular, absolute construct that binds all possible and impossible realities. There are no copies. No imitations. The Allsphere is all. And beyond that? There is nothing.
The Allsphere doesn’t stop at what can be imagined. It extends far beyond imagination into the realms of the unthinkable, the impossible, and the undefined. It contains every story ever told, every story that could never be told, and every story that will never be thought of. It is the library of existence, but it is also the fire that burns the library down, the ash that remains, and the memory of a book that was never written. The most terrifying concept of the Allsphere is that non-existence itself is accounted for. Even the absence of something is still a part of the Allsphere because it
exists
as a concept. Paradoxes, deleted realities, corrupted timelines, and even realms that should not exist are all encapsulated within the Allsphere.
The Allsphere includes realms beyond
THE
and even the
Final Fractalism
. It encompasses concepts so vast that even labeling them as 'higher' realities is insufficient. Realms where narrative laws crumble and only raw thought remains. Where existence itself is an anomaly and non-existence is a constant threat. Even the beyond is within the Allsphere. Beyond beyond. Beyond logic. Beyond perception. Beyond the boundaries of thought itself. Even thoughts that died before they were formed. Even futures that collapsed before they began. Even fragments of forgotten gods whose names were never spoken. They all breathe within the Allsphere. The Allsphere does not care about logic, nor does it obey the boundaries imposed by mortal comprehension.
Even the very notion of the Allsphere as “one” entity is a limitation imposed by thought. It isn’t one thing or many things. It simply is, in the way that existence itself simply is. To try to define it is to misunderstand it, because definition implies boundaries, and the Allsphere has none. It doesn’t expand because it has nowhere to expand to. It doesn’t exist “outside” or “inside” because it encompasses the concept of inside and outside.
On a more “physical” scale, The Allsphere encompasses an incomprehensibly vast structure of nested realities, known as
hierarchies
. Each hierarchy represents a chain of containment, starting with the smallest scale, a universe. Universes are contained within multiverses, which in turn are contained within megaverses, and so on, culminating in omniverses.
There are hierarchies of hierarchies, hierarchies of hierarchies of hierarchies, and so on. Infact, this branches off infinitely. There are trillions of hierarchy chains. And multiply that by all the hierarchies of hierarchies everywhere. Trillions of trillions of trillions of new hierarchies branching off each each one. And the same number again branching off of each of those. An absolutely uncountably infinite amount of hierarchies forming "
trees
" in a very metaphysical way. Then an incomprehensible amount of these trees branching off each other, which is all contained within the Allsphere, as well as an infinite amount of other things, ranging from the
Final Fractalism
,
THE
, and the
Imagination Box
.
In the Allsphere, time itself doesn’t move the way it does in lower dimensions. It exists all at once and at no time at all. Different timelines and timelines within timelines coexist, but none are locked into any singular flow of past, present, and future. You can find entire timelines that have already happened and will never happen again, but they exist simultaneously with those that are just beginning and those that have yet to be formed. Nothing "contains" it, because that's simply not possible. There is nothing. There is nothingness. There is no past, present, or future. There is no "now" or "here". There is not even a "there" for there to be, since there's nothing. There is a complete lack concepts of space, time, existence, and reality. Past this point, everything is simply gone. All concepts, all existence, all possibility is missing. There is nothing that can be done, since every possible action, and any trace of the concept of "
action
" has been removed entirely, and thusly doesn't exist.
On a deeper level, you may find
our own world
, making it
far, far
beyond concepts. It contains everything yet is defined by nothing. It is infinite but goes beyond
what infinite could ever mean.
It is the dream of a dreamer who has never existed, the thought of a thinker who will never be, the story of a storyteller whose pen will never touch the page. It is the answer to every question, but it doesn’t care for questions. It doesn’t need to.
