The
buttfrickverse
is a Verse that contains

. It contains a very interesting species called buttfrickers. It appears as though buttfrickers are future humans, as they look very similar and have similar technology (just more advanced).

Also, a group of Buttfrickers once tried to get to a smaller place in the hierarchy, but interestingly, once they passed
The Box
, they were 🅱️eleted until measures against said 🅱️eletion were developed.
