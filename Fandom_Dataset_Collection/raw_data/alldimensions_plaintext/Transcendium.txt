Transcendium
is one of the main elements that the
Trascendent universes
have. Its also dispersed in very small quantity in almost all 'verses contained by the
Trascendent universe
. Weirdly, you can eat it. It makes you stronger the more you eat it. Its average temperature is 20°, but when you are consuming Trascendium its temperature goes a lot higher, from 5000° to 1000000°, so an average human can't eat Transcendium.
Only 4 transcendium are capable of creating entities. Using 8, 30, 50, 1,000 or even more could create bigger and stronger entities.
