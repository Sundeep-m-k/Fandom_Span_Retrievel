The
Frontrooms
is a
realm
very similar to the
Backrooms
, but to gain access to them, you have to no-clip INSIDE of reality.
The Frontrooms is like a reverse version of the
planet
Earth
. In the Frontrooms, several totally destroyed buildings and cities can be found everywhere, being similar to the ones made on Earth. This is something that causes fear to researchers, because it could be a probable alternate timeline of Earth with some concerning probabilities of happening. If this is proven, your idea of ​​being "the Frontrooms" will be discarded.
The Frontrooms has 6 levels, starting off in the surface, then ending in the underworld, but strangely it gets brighter and brighter the lower you go.
Each floor of the front room gets more peaceful and quiet, meaning less
monsters
per floor,
Levels

Level 0 - The Surface
[
]
This is the most terrifying and infamous level. Monsters here are very common, buildings are collapsing everywhere, along with destroyed bridges. Fire can be seen everywhere, and the sky is pitch black. Most victims die here,  either because a monster kills them, they get burned, crushed by a structure or one of the neon blue floating orbs electrocutes them.
When you first no-clip here, you spawn inside a retail store called “Bob’s soup and stuff”, everything here is perfectly in shape as if no monster ever came there.
Monsters in Level 0.
[
]
There are eight different types of monsters you can find in Level 0, all of them are deadly in some way, if you see one the only solution is to run away.
The Room
[
]
The Room, aka the Cursed Room, this creature is the least deadly because it’s the easiest to avoid, these types of monsters are everywhere in the surface. To find on of these you have to enter a glowing building, once you enter you will start to notice that the walls are closing and that flesh is covering the door, so it’s best to stay in Bob’s soup shop.
Nuclear Blob
[
]
Nuclear Blob, what a strange name. The Nuclear blob, is a block that’s radioactive hence its name. You can find this type of creature in a nuclear wasteland, once you reach there you will see some sort of melting green, glowing blob with a strange face. This creature is extremely radioactive and can intoxicate anyone in a 30 meter radius, this creature rarely moves but if you see one in a city, then you’re doomed.
The Forgotten Human
[
]
The Forgotten Human is the shape of a regular human, but they have no facial features, and the whole body is complete darkness. It normally wields a Fire-fighter axe or a 3 meter long blade. It is very hostile and will kill you thinking that you have the key, the reason why it has no facial features or are completely dark because it has been possessed by Multavix so it can kill any survivors.
Phantom King
[
]
The Phantom King, or the king of the ghosts, pretty weird since there are no ghosts In the surface. This monster isn’t anything extraordinary, his appearance is a transparent 3 meter tall, green, monster with red eyes. But he is kind of like an enderman, if you look at his eye, he hunts you.
Social Guy
[
]
The most boring creature, this specimen isn’t hostile or anything, but he is considered the most deadly due to his extremely boring stories. This guy is a regular human, but if he finds you he will start telling boring stories about his dog, cat, grandma, his journey to the park, how he escaped the Temple of King Midas, and many boring stories. He will follow you anywhere you go and he will even die with you. The problem with this guy is the more you ignore him, the more hostile he gets, so you better have the time to listen to all of his stories.
Dirt Man
[
]
The most mysterious creature due to what is he made out of, dirt. You can find this entity anywhere that is filled with mud, so this type of creature mostly reside in swamps. His appearance is blocky, like a fusion between minecraft Steve and a roblox character, except they are made out of dirt. This creature wields a Khopesh made out of dirt, it may sound weird but one slice is enough to knock you out.
Multavix
[
]
Finally, the most deadly creature in the surface - Multavix, the god of the dragons. It is a 500 foot tall, 3 headed dragon. It is the guardian of the gate where you are supposed to go, it Is the one who holds the key, so you better be armed. It can sense any creature coming towards it from a kilometer radius, once it senses a creature, it goes to attack. It’s attacks are, toxic breathe, fire breathe, and stomp, where the dragon jumps 10 kilometers high and when it crashes it causes a shockwave, the only way to survive is... idk. Be lucky, I guess.

Trivia
[
]
In the actual Backrooms canon, the Frontrooms
is
the Earth and the
opposite
of the Backrooms. And I have not a goddamn clue on how you would no-clip
inside
of reality.
If you want to, you
can
say that this version (the one that is this page) is canon I guess, but it is not generally canon to the Backrooms' lore. And yes, the Backrooms are now very popular, if you're somehow wondering why,
