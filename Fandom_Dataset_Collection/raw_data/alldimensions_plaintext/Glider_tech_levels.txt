The
glider tech levels
are the levels of advancement that glider-using multiversal civilisations tend to travel through. Not all civilisations pass through every level, and not always in the same order, not to mention civilisations that don't even use gliders at all, but on average they represent a typical trajectory.

Nudge Tech Levels
[
]
Before gliders are developed, civilisations tend to use nudge-style drives for interuniversal travel. These are covered in more detail in the
nudge tech levels
article.
Early Glider Tech Levels
[

Heavy Nudge
[
]
Heavy nudge
technology isn’t a “true”
glider
, but remains an expensive way for early
glider-era civilisations
to begin sending complex payloads all at once to different universes. A heavy nudge is exactly what it sounds like – a
nudge drive
using a truly enormous amount of energy, collimated using advanced
infomatter
techniques, to send the equivalent of a glider without actually being a stable structure.
Resonant
[
]
Resonant
technology is the creation of
gliders
using naturally occurring nearby
universes
, by using copious amounts of
infomatter
to slowly construct a glider suspended between the two. This is much more expensive energetically per than creating a glider in a recently split universe, but has lower setup costs because no cosmic splitting has to occur.
Branching Tech Levels
[

Search-style drives are more complicated, requiring truly high-dimensional construction techniques. Essentially, search-drives construct a high-dimensional "glider" embedded on their surface of the multiverse, which travels in a straight geodesic until it hits a universe and deposits its informational payload. Because the interuniversal void is outside of time, this allows for, in theory, arbitarily distant universes to be contacted instantly.
In practise, the construction of the glider is a difficult task, since it requires projection from a low-dimensional spacetime into a high-dimensional one. The simplest ones exploit the natural splitting of a universe; when seeded properly with infomatter (on the scale of billions of light years), and then forced into a state change (say, a false vacuum collapse), the universe splits in two along a high-dimensional surface and the close proximity of alternate versions of the infomatter array at the moment of splitting allows them to interact well enough to assemble the glider. This technique is known as branching.
Defect Branching
[
]
Defect branching
technology uses
cosmic defects
to create two recently split
universes
- for example, creating a
glider
by expanding a
domain wall
along the third, fourth and fifth dimensions. This creates a small gap in which gliders can be generated, but their payloads are very limited compared to more advanced branching technologies.
State-change Branching
[
]
State-change branching
what one thinks of when they imagine a
branch-era civilisation
. A state-change branching civilisation induces a
cosmic state change
in the vacuum of their
universe
, which causes the separation between the universes' splits to be great enough to create a universe-sized
glider
in between.
External split Branching
[
]
External split branching
works by the same fundamental principles as state-change branching, but with the split induced by firing a nudge or
glider
projectile from a neighbouring universe. This allows for greater expressiveness in the design of gliders, because they no longer have to also be able to induce a split from inside the universe where they're built.
Looping Tech Levels
[
]
The number of state-changes available to a universe before it stops being capable of hosting infomatter, however, is limited; only a finite number can be performed before the universe becomes mangled. This can be avoided by setting up a "rake" on the surface of the multiverse which continally returns to the same state, releasing a glider each time; this is difficult, and requires a great many universes to be expended by branching, as well as a constant stream of universes as fuel, but when performed can continue producing gliders indefinitely. Being outside of time, the only limit is how fast universes can be fed into it. The production of a repeating rake is known as looping.
