Abstract:
In a high dimensionality verse that's higher then
Transillud Omnistructure
is the principle that will apply. {This principle only applies to
Hexaprobability orbital
] and induviduals affected by it are equal to, or lower then this existance rank.
In a system with high dimensionality,  you can observe a inferior verse more accuratly but you'd lose accuracy over what's around this verse. Same if you observed the verses around you more accuratly,  which means you'd lose accuracy over the singular verse and it is no longer in sight. Since, the verse had suddenly vanished due to the uncertainty principle. Since the dimensionality is so high that is literally disrupts the functions of the observer to see things properly.
Elaboration...
This uncertainty is because a singular verse that's observed would disappear from sight by "blurring away" once the surrounding verses are observed with high enough accuracy.  To elaborate,  it's going away from you faster while being blurred.  So if you re-focus back without completly blowing the focus off , then it would have appeared to change position. It could be any distance depending on how much you've focused on one particular thing and it could be either the verse or the surroundings.
This doesn't mean you can never see a verse again. It means that you will unlikely find it again as it acts like an electron in some way,  it pops out somewhere else if you observe it. However, that means your surroundings will become "More blurry/Scattered." as if it went out of focus. If you focus back at your surroundings,  it would appear as if the surrounding verses had moved.  Think of "Green light" "Red light." in how this operates but it relies on your focus.
The principle has 2 ways of focus:

{\displaystyle \Delta \amalg}
and

I
{\displaystyle \Delta I}
(Use a graphing calculator please!)
Let's give your imagination a try! Please read the following instructions! I'm going to give you the appourtunity to visually experiment!
Remember the equation? Put this into desmos! I'll show you an example for those who are curious! This shows the accuracy factor of the "Singular point." vs "The enviroment." If you have read this,  you understand the singular point is the inferior verse this article spoke of.  The enviroment being the verses around inferior verse you are observing right now in your mind. Our symbols are here to be concise.

{\displaystyle \Delta \amalg}

Put the equation into any graphing calculator. I recommend Desmos for this!
Define a

a

{\displaystyle -10\geq a\leq10}
You should see a spiky graph.  Please understand that the more "spikier it is." the more accurate you will be able to visually see your surrounding verses.
Center yourself to (0,0) in Desmos or anything similar and have the right zoom so you can see the entire spike.
Remember again:  Spikier means accurate! If you're unsure,  refer to the instructions.
Explaining:
If a = 0 then there will be a straight line through the graph,  then you are in the uncertain region of your focus, so imagine a mix of
Δ
⨿
{\displaystyle \Delta \amalg}
and
Δ
I
{\displaystyle \Delta I}
being equally blurry at once. It's where don't you have enough focus for an object to go away from you but your object will be equally as inaccurate as your surroundings.
If a > 0 then the graph will be spikier and this means
Δ
⨿
{\displaystyle \Delta \amalg}
will be more visually accurate and
Δ
I
{\displaystyle \Delta I}
will be significantly inaccurate. It means,  the object is so blurry that it appears to go away from you.
If a=10 then you can accuratly see the other verses surrounding you,  but not the verse you just looked at! It's now gone!  Now... up to you to find your home! Chop chop!
Remember! Delta 2 means the enviroment! The surrounding verses that you see now!
But hold on! What happens if a<0?  If a is less then 0,  you are about to lose complete visual accuracy of your verse and think of it as this: The more screwed up the graph, the faster the verse goes away from you,  WITH visual loss of it. Play around with it! At this point the graph will be screwed up, and that's fine! Revert a to 0 and start over the experiment!
For understanding: (Delta 1)
Δ
I
{\displaystyle \Delta I}
Do the exact same thing as
Δ
⨿
{\displaystyle \Delta \amalg}
[
]
Explaining: If a=0,   then it's the same thing as before.
Δ
I
{\displaystyle \Delta I}
Δ
⨿
{\displaystyle \Delta \amalg}
are both equally inaccurate.  If a>0 then
Δ
I
{\displaystyle \Delta I}
will significantly be focused and easier to see while your enviroment seems to blurr out of existance. If a=10 then everything is completly black in the background and you can see the verse ahead of you clear as day!  That's how you can visualise the entire principle! Isn't it fun?
Fun fact,  if you focus back to
Δ
⨿
{\displaystyle \Delta \amalg}
then the enviroment has completly changed! It appears that the "Green light/"Red light" mechanism applies when you gain back focus of the enviroment when you lose enough visual accuracy over
Δ
⨿
{\displaystyle \Delta \amalg}
. Same happened with
Δ
I
{\displaystyle \Delta I}

Dimensional uncertainty principle:
Multidimensional complex principle:  If there is too much dimensions contained  in a medium, then everything below the existance rank of
Hexaprobability orbital
will not be able to accuratly observe more then two dimensions. You can shift your focus from for example(3d and 4d) to (5d and 6d). You can't brute force the rule unless if you are a higher existance rank.  The uncertainty principle will still apply unless if you're a higher existance rank, but being equal to it does not work.
This principle has the same equation, same instructions to visuallise but if you're familiar then you don't need to. You cannot observe more then 2 dimensionalities at once. It's so screwed up to the point of dimensionalities coliding in paradoxical ways. It's a result of something screwing up very badly.
Superposition uncertainty:
In existance rank standards and size,  "a" MUST be 10 to 1 IF me or anybody else wants to use it!  It is a superposition of 10 numbers. If you think a number between 10-1,  then that's what variable "a" will be. You cannot accuratly measure all the numbers at once because x also changes between 1-10,  only one of them applies! That's what makes it uncertain if the equation has a true answer,  it has all the answers at once! Just, if you observe it then that "a" would become the number you'd think of.
