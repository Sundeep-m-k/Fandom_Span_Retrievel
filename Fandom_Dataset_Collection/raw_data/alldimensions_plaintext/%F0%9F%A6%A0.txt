ðŸ¦ 
AKA AiÃ³vakfinity is the most insane number ever. To only reach a minimal part of it, you must take ALL the recorded numbers of
AD
,
AFE
,
Googology
and
Fictional Googology
wiki numbers
[

and make each one of them get exponentiated by the one bigger than them

(the result will be represented as R) then do R^R^R^R^R^R^R^R^R... up to R times. Then repeat all the process with the new obtained number (representated with S) up to S times more. Then again. Again. AGAIN. The next numbers can be representated in alphabetical order (T, U, V, etc.) up to Z. Redo all this mentioned progress AGAIN using Z as R, and only then you'll reach about a Z

th of a Z
R

times part of ðŸ¦ .
An easier way to express this number is taking the R and doing this calculation: R^^^16*((R^^^8)^R)^^2
This number is the smallest of these value-absorbing type of numbers, the next ones being

â†‘
If more numbers are created in these wikis, this WONT change ðŸ¦ 's value, since ðŸ¦  is so powerful it already knows all the numbers that will ever be added in those four wikis, before they even exist.
â†‘
Any logic countering the absorption is countered by ðŸ¦  back, meaning no number resists it.
â†‘
Negative numbers get turned into positive for the calculation of ðŸ¦ . Decimals get turned into numbers AT LEAST above 1. Example: 0,2 gets turned into 2, 0,13412134 gets turned into 1,3412134, etc.
â†‘
In AD and AFE wikis you also must include the size of the verses / power of the entities, etc.
