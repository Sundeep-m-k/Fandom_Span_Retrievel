Frames
[
]
Frames "frame" the structure of things. There is a frame for every possible structure and they may represent concepts such as math or emotion. Structures may consist of containments, like how the real numbers contain all integers in a math frame, or more abstract things such as consciousness, recursion and infinities.
The rest of the page focusses on a possible structure that contains humanity. This frame has two hierarchies, the consciousness hierarchy and the spacetime hierarchy. It is important to note that not all frames have this structure, and most other pages on this wiki can be categorized to be in a frame which has a different or added structure(s).
Spacetime hierarchy
[
]
State space - Time web - Time tree - Timeline - State
States
[
]
At the bottom of the spacetime hierarchy are states. A state is a configuration that space can be in.
State spaces
[
]
At the top of the spacetime hierarchy are state spaces. These are multi-dimensional spaces containing every possible state. There are an infinite amount of state spaces, not all of which are as complex or stable as ours.
Every point in a space state is a state and moving that point will continuously transition it to another state. The amount of dimensions a state space depends on how many variables there are. If a state is made out of 10 points in a 4d space (and absolutely nothing else) then the state space will have 40 dimensions, each controlling where in 4d space each of the points are.
Our state space
[
]
Our state space could be one of three types.
Singular state space
[
]
The simplest type. Everything is what it seems. Singular state spaces are finite and do not posses true randomness.
Recursive state space
[
]
If you zoom into the big bang or out from the big bang with both scale and time, you will find another universe just like ours. There is no "before" the big bang because you can only get closer to the big bang but never pass it.
Fractal state space
[
]
If you zoom into any spot you will find another universe just like ours. If you zoom out you will find that our universe is part of a greater universe. Our universe is infinite because it loops in on itself and outside of this loop you will find another universe. Fractal state spaces are infinite and have true randomness.
Time Hierarchy
[
]
The time hierarchy is made up of ways the states, with time, move through the state space. All states in a state space are connected through time, though not necessarily all with eachother.
Time webs
[
]
A time web is the manifestation of time within a space state and a space state can support multiple time webs. Time webs can be thought of as "time spaces" made by laws of physics.
Time trees
[
]
Time trees are the result of some sorts of time travel, like the ones shown in science fiction. Time trees can also be the result of randomness, branching off and creating a "multiverse" or "parallel timelines". If everything has a chance of happening (like in the case of a fractal state space), a time web becomes one big time tree. If true randomness does not exist (like in the case of a singular state space), there wont be any time trees.
Timelines
[
]
In the absence of time trees, timelines are directly below time webs in the hierarchy. They are the simplest form of time, a 1 dimensional line through which a state moves in a state space
Consciousness Hierarchy
[
]
Experience area - Experience path - Consciousness
Consciousness
[
]
Consciousnesses do not inherently follow the same timelines as states do and are not constrained to one frame. While timelines may be finite, consciousness do not end and are infinite (even if that means going in a loop). You are the experience of a consciousness. Time does not move at the same speed for all consciousnesses, as it depends on how fast they can process information.
For a consciousness to be in several frames, the structure its a part of in both frames must be the same. No information is transferred.
Experience area
[
]
An experience area contains every experience a consciousness can have. An experience area can span over several state spaces and frames. Several experience areas can "intersect" and since experience areas can have many dimensions (like space states), the intersection is an area with fewer but nonetheless many dimensions.
Experience path
[
]
The path that consciousnesses take on their experience area is called an experience path. An individual may take several experience paths and meet themselves as a result of time travel. Experience paths tend to run very closely to timelines, although artifacts such as immortality may appear.
Comparisons

Different experience path: The version of you that became as famous as elon musk (assuming youre not as famous as elon musk) exists on a different experience path.
Different experience area: Your mother is on a different experience area that "intersects" with your experience area.
Different timeline: As long as there is even the tiniest chance that earth instantly disappears, there is a branch on the time tree containing a timeline where earth no longer exists
Different time tree: A different time tree would contain a universe whose starting conditions are different
Different time web: Incomprehensible. Physics is different so stars could be cube shaped and earth could be inhabited by british metal spheres.
Different state space: Even more incomprehensible. Every system of things ever possible.
Different frame: Visit any page on this wiki and you will probably find yourself reading the structure of other frames.
