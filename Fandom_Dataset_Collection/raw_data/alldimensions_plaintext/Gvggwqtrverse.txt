Structure
[
]
The Gvggwqtrverse is divided into 5 parts. These 5 parts are each a different color, but it is pretty easy to see that before they were all white-colored.
The Red Part
[
]
The red part is the biggest part, centered right in the middle of the Gvggwqtrverse. This section is filled with all sorts of red-colored things, such as ketchup, hot sauce, red peppers, human blood, red tomatoes, red apples, raspberries, and a lot more. This section, while being the most messed up, has the most life.
There is a tiny fragment of the Red Part which broke off when Bean Man slapped the Red Part very, very, very, very, very, very lightly.
Life
[
]
The life in the Red Part are very oddly shaped creatures which can deform at will and turn into a soup of
Primordium Particles
. This life is relatively basic, but do have a rudimentary government (which is a dictatorship) and language. The language is very strange, with it sounding like random, loud noises. Due to this, the creatures who speak this language are known as the Siren Heads (which coincidentally is also a creepypasta).
The Blue Part
[
]
The blue part is one of the most empty parts. There are a lot of blue things in this verse, such as blue water, Smurfs, and pure blue blueberries. Due to the lack of naturally blue things, this part is very empty. This area also has no life (if you don't count the Smurfs).
The Yellow Part
[
]
The yellow part is the most solid part. There is no part in it which isn't solid. Just like the previous verses, there are a lot of yellow things in here, such as bananas, egg yolks, yellow dwarf stars, AD links, and dried grass.
Life
[
]
The life in the Yellow Part do not have a physical form due to The Yellow Part being entirely solid. Even though they do not have collision physics, they can still interact with the Yellow Part. This life has a 2 word language, with the words being "gwtd (yes)" and "juhr (no)".
The Pink Part
[
]
The pink part is the most watery part, with no part in it being solid or gaseous. There are a lot of pink things in this verse, such as pigs, lotuses, pink roses, pink tulips, and American flamingos.
Life
[
]
The life here are pigs. These pigs swim in the Pink Part and can breathe in water. These pigs are the most advanced civilization in the Gvggwqtrverse, with their civilization being a democracy and having many high tech inventions and gadgets.
The Greenish Part
[
]
The Greenish Part is the smallest part, and is entirely gas. This is the only part to not have things inside of it that share its color, instead housing many shrines dedicated to
Dave
. There is no life in the Greenish Part.
