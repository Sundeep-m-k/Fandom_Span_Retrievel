Escaping from the Box, you may expect that you landed in a
void
... Actually, you are in another
verse
made with that.
A
Cetaverse
is the first metaboxial
Archverse
layer, consisting with infinite
Boxes
,
Bxoes
and
Broxes
, because the dimensionalities of those are also infinite.
These verses are unstable, as they contain the river streams as
Le Jorino Areas
, containing with objects with existence states outside the Boxial range, which is the range of 0 to 1. There is a really heavy force which pushes objects with "the Boxial" existence ranks into one of the Boxes and the Broxes, but pulls other objects out to the Le Jorino streams.
Like those smaller Boxes, no physical things could escape these verses.

The Matrix
[
]
The Matrix in which these Boxes and Broxes are suspended in, cause the light duplicate, but in a way that causes the magnitude to converge and not diverge. The product is a faint glow. However, the Cetaverse has a strange shape which has multiple centers and the closer to the center, the more structure is present. Thus, the higher concentrations of Boxes and Broxes cause visibly glowing points.
Each center of the Cetaverse is a "white" singularity, where the matrix gets compressed further and further, until it collapses into a Le Jorino Area.
The Center
[
]
Near the center, the density and/or the concentration of Boxes and Broxes is so much that they glow whiter. Those Boxes and Broxes are clustered separately, although some Boxes survive within the Brox's shield. For one portion from the order of magnitude, 99% of the portion is made of either Boxes or Broxes, but 1% is made of the opposing type. However, there is a phenomenon for this location.
As you get close to the center, the space gets more compressed until you reach the Singularity, which is a massive Le Jorino area, with a radius of 0.2x times the size of a Box. This is only the area where the objects stay here, whether you change your existence rank or not. The only way to escape is to have infinite speeds, which is almost impossible. The cause of this phenomenon is discovered at the Formation section.
In the other side, as you go further, you might see less Boxes and Broxes and more Le Jorino streams.
Formation of a Cetaverse
[
]
Back when a Cetaverse is formed, they consist of a chaos of objects with random
existence ranks
. Later, objects that can exist or not are often getting clustered by the forces of existence-(4, 5) structures consisting with 13% of
Primordium Delta
particles and others. Those forces push the
Dimensional Blueprint Particles
of those objects to a really high "distorsion" level, causing the topology to be a fractal temporarily. Then suddenly, those forces suddenly push objects outside of physical existence ranks out. The compression by those forces turn the location to a center with the singularity.
This lead to the Cetaverses being populated with various existence states from 0 to 1. Each point of the collision with existence-(4, 5) objects marks a separate center in the Cetaverse, explaining the Cetaverse's "odd shape" that contains multiple centers.
The expansion seems to be never end, as the outside of these verses contain existence-(0, 1) and existence-(4, 5) objects, and so much more. Most Cetaverses are 10
30
times bigger than a Box!

Trivia
[
]
This is not a "Box" of smaller Boxes, due to this type of verse following the
axiom
of Archverses.
This is the last normal verse in the
Official
Hierarchy
before the chain of weird verses begin.
Be careful, because some things are either extremly weird or feel like a generic verse!
The first one of this chain are the
Mandelbrotverses
.
Be careful of
Roe
.
