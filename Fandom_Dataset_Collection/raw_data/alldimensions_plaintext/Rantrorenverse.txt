A
Rantrorenverse
is an extremely small type of
universe
, and even if the photo on the infobox is taken from the world's best telescope, it still is a small bright
circle
. The one in the photo has a
moon
designated as "Rantro 1". Both of them are also
voids
.
These
verses
are so small, that their actual size is unknown.

These
verses
are so small, that their actual size is unknown, though there are many estimations for the size of their kind, the most accepted one saying that they might have an average size of -ε
0
ly (and the moon of the one in the infobox is -ε
1
ly). The (possibly) most accurate one says that they have a size of
−

ly and

ly respectively, though.

There's no confirmed
life
which lives and rules over the Rantrorenverses and even Rantro 1. However, there's some lifeforms speculated, called
the Rantrorenversians
, and there's some changes that appear life must be there. Although Rantro 1 has less void than it's universe, it has about as half as the Rantrorenverse.
