Translated to literally just "people" in
Chochachw
, the Chocha, as mentioned in their empire article
Chochachfchfchy
, are very kind naturally and seem to have many features shared with the shells and exoskeleton bearing Arthropods, including on/off compound eyes and a hard shell, like mentioned. However, what they
also
have is a set of mandibles beneath their smiles, most similar to the inner mouth/tongue of a Hymenoptera, as well as very small "hairs" on their inside parts of the hands to increase grip, although they can only be seen up close.
Personality wise, although they are kind to each other and every sapient species they've met so far, keep in mind sapient. Anything that can't solve 2+2 by the age of 5 is most likely on the menu (unless it is of course a special needs Chocha). And they don't discriminate, with hunting being a rather large industry, heavily regulated of course, but as they expanded they brought more game with them to the planets they ruthlessly wiped to original (unintelligent) life off of so more of this cheesemeat collection would roll in. Some empires have even said that they're kinder to plants than animals. They of course have livestock, but only half a dozen species. This craze
is
beginning to fade, although it will take roughly 0.65 OYC to change these habits, according to the Several Secret Seeing Services of Chochachfchfchy.
Hunting out of the way, they practice a religion known as... Chfrchy, religion in Chochachw. The religion, in short is one that praises some sort of many-armed deity who's main feature is kindness, and sin is gluttony. The religion is focused around how everything, even the highest of gods, has a sin and redeeming quality. With their isolation and time to develop their faiths, it's much more complicated than that. Just one last note, they worship a milk bottle that isn't cheesed. How they were able to comprehend such a thing before meeting non-cheese life, we may never know.
