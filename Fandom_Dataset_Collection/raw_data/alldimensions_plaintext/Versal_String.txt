Versal Strings
are
structures
of
Divergent Containers
coming together in a spiral and helical structure. Because Divergent Containers can stack, they make extremely long strands and attract each other, although if you zoom out enough, you will see that they wrap around each other.
Although not very interesting by themselves, Versal Strings form
Versal Fibers
, which are extremely strong. Also, lots of Versal Fibers form
Dropoffs
.

Although Versal Fibers are stronger than Versal Strings, the latters are still extremely strong, with an amazing

, they become unstable and scatter, eventually forming into another Versal String. The only time when this doesn't happen is when they form into Versal Fibers.
