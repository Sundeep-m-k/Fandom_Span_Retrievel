The Fuel
is a large space enveloping
The Process
. It
has a lot of energy in it
.
The Fuel
does not have anything other than energy
. Although this might make the verse seem useless, it is vital to the generator in The Process, and constantly supplies it with energy which leaks into The Process via its holes in its barrier.
The energy in The Fuel
comes in all forms
, including solid, liquid, gas, plasma, and everything else. These forms of energy
are mixed with Lanatanium (134,421,523th element) to be able to have states of matter
.
Solid energy is especially hard to traverse/use and makes up over 52% of The Fuel's energy. If used correctly and efficiently, it can be an extremely good source of energy.
Liquid energy is best used as a source of energy for natural beings.
Gaseous energy is the hardest form of energy to use, and is also used the rarest.
Plasma energy is very hard to contain/use, but it is the most efficient out of all of the other forms of energy.
The Fuel, other than leaking energy into The Process,
also leaks energy outside of it
(mainly in liquid form).
