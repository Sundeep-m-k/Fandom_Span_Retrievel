The
Pictographverse
, or
UNI-571991
, is a
Verse
contained by a nearby
Multiverse
to ours. Whenever the Pictographverse is written about in any capacity or form, certain words written in relation to the Pictographverse are spontaneously turned into a corresponding pictograph. Certain ambiguities are caused by this. It is otherwise a normal
Universe
. The native and most advanced creatures are creatures that somehow speak in pictographs, despite pictographs being entirely visual.
