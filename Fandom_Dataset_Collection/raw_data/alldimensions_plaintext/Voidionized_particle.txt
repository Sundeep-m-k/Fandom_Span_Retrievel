Voidionized particles
also known as void particles are particles that have been exposed to the All void or other omega-voids for too long.
These particles are usually slightly glitchy.
Voidionized particles
don't exist but they somehow do exist. This is because
Voidionized particles
are fully empty and have a type of effect on other particles making them act differently. because normal particles act differently if a
Voidionized particle
collides with them, u can get a picture of what a void particle looks like and this is the only known way to do so. They are slightly similar to virtual particles, but this is not even close in similarity but it is the most similar type of particle.

What proto or particles can be voidionized?
spacial distortion
[
]
If
Voidionized particles
are clumped together they will distort the nearby particles and space. Until they are pulled apart again.
fluctuating attraction and repulsion
[
]
These particles keep fluctuating. One moment they act as an attracting force and the other a repulsion force. The more
Voidionized particles
are clumped together the stronger the fluctuating force is. If the clump and mass is big enough about 10X the size of an average galaxy. Then the fluctuating force becomes more powerful than its own gravity that's pulling it together. And it falls apart.
normal VS Voidionized particles
[
]
Voidionized particles are useful for breaking through thick barriers of void as they distort space around them if clumped together.
voidionization
[
]
Not a lot is known about the voidionization process but it is possible that it can only happen in the
All void
or maybe even in any other omega class voids with similar properties to the
all void
.
