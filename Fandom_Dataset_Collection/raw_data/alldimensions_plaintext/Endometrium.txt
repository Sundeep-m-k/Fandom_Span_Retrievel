Endometrium
is the -1st
element
of the
periodic table
. This element is very weird, as it's atomic number is -1, but it is just made out of anti-
protons
, with the
electrons
being replaced by positrons.
The element is found only in the
Antiverses
or can be created using
true anti logic
and scientists think that this element will trigger the destruction of their local
black dwarves
in the far future.
It has no known uses outside research and the production of antimatter bombs.
