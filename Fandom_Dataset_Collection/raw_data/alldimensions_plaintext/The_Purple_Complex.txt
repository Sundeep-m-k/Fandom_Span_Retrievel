The Purple Complex
is a artificial structure located at the edge of the
Coolverse
built by the verse's inhabitance. and is meant to act as essentially a reboot card for whenever the
Coolverse
collapses from a major cosmic event, such as heat

death. The complex is approximately 2,048 km in each direction. Because even though the supercomputers in
The Purple Complex
are extremely advanced (which is why it's only a few thousand kilometers), they have to contain and evaluate the Quantum Entropy and the hundreds of billions of years of Thermodynamic events that take place in the
Coolverse
.
Procedures
Whenever the
Coolverse
is about to collapse, The entrance to the Complex will stay open for a few decades before temporarily sealing itself off from the
Coolverse
, this is the 1st Stage. Stage 2 is evaluating all the data that has been cataloged to replicate the clockwork of the
Coolverse
, this stage usually takes a few 100 years to complete.
In between Stage 2 and Stage 3, The Subspace Chrono-Drive is activated, which basically makes time in
The Purple Complex
Extremely slow to the rest of the verse. Making 100 trillion years in the
Coolverse
only last a few decades in
The Purple Complex
. This intermission occurs when the verse is collapsing, and will last until the verse inevitably fades to black.
Stage 3 is when the bomb that essentially creates an artificial big bang is prepared, it contains a
Subspace dimension
with a set amount of energy stored inside of it. When the bomb is detonated, the subspace will instantly decay and the energy will be released. The Final Stage is placing the bomb into Realspace and then detonating it, creating a big bang that will restart the cycle anew.
Trivia
• This structure was built approximately 20 billion years ago.
• The reason why this structure hasn't decayed at all is because it's constantly being 'Refreshed' using Quantum technology
• The supercomputers are
Uqraek fiber
-based, therefore allowing them to store unimaginable amounts of data and computing power
