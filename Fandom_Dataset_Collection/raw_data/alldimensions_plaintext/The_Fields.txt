Cosmi-ants
[
]
Cosmi-ants are blue colored beasts with lots of eyes and legs. They have a similar appearance to Earth's ants. They can show  aggressive behavior, and eat other Cosmi-animals.
Cosmi-snails
[
]
Cosmi-snails, like the cosmi-ants are very different to their earth-version, in this case being a snail with crab legs and teeth. They are 2 times bigger than the Cosmi-ants. Their behavior can vary from peacefull to a bit aggresive. They eat lots of Grassium.
Cosmi-mantis
[
]
Unlike the others, Cosmi-mantis really look like an
Earth
Mantis, but with different colors. They are 1.5 times bigger than a Cosmi-snail. They are the most dangerous and aggresive animals of the Fields. They eat even more things than the Cosmi-ants
Its confirmed that there are a lot of other non-finded Cosmi-animals waiting for us...
At least now we only know the existence of the cosmi-ants, snails and mantis. But, we can maybe find some Cosmi-cows!
