About
[
]
Skebob
, also known as
Скебоб
is a dreadfully powerful
entity
with enough strength and will to threaten the entirety of
fiction
.
This is because of their overpowered meme status, thus granting it
Memetic
levels of power and justifying their dominance in battles.
Lore
[
]
(This is based from a
spanish meme song
)
Skebob once was a being of fragility, a mere weakling, the bottom of the barrel in any situation you could think of. In fact, all they could do was to lose once, twice, thrice and repeat. An almost sisyphean task that each time it inevitably took place bringed Skebob even further down their eternal streak of loss.
That doesn't mean Skebob was an individual that you should feel pity for though, as they never cared about anything other than to win. Their lack of power was the only thing preventing them from becoming a relentless menace.
That at least WAS the case, until Skebob found the artifact that finally gave an end to their all-losing existence... a mango
[

.
What the fu
Skebob, without hesitation, ate it. The bird expected said meal to not do anything other than make their existence last for longer, but they were wrong. DEAD wrong, in fact.
That was the very moment their true power rose, thanks to the properties of the mango. It was a mere matter of time until Skebob knew about said abilities, so they began to use them for their own gain. This is when Skebob began to be simply known as "the winning bird".
Skebob got used to the success of the mango's effect pretty much instantly. Each victory only made their ego increase, to the point Skebob quickly became a full blown megalomaniac, which had the only goal to win over everything and be the strongest, even if that meant they should become the potential end of all existences in order to keep on with that goal of theirs.
Skebob's entire being had truly turned into a pyrrhic victory. An undeserved one.
T.B.A.
Appearance
[
]
At least in their base form, Skebob is a black crow-like being with a round body, a large beak ressembling a toucan's and a frizzy head of hair. It is also standing on a tree branch, which sometimes glues to Skebob's body.
Abilities
[

Win force
[
]
The mango's effect on Skebob made the latter turn into a being whose quirk is to win in any possible situation. Basically an insanely buffed combination of probability manipulation and reality warping.

Aura generation
[
]
Skebob can generate an aura surrounding their body which randomly changes color.Despite that, this does NOT count as some kind of Skebob's second phase, as it is still part of their first one instead, though specifically indicating a slighty higher use of its base form's powers.
Here's a list of some of Skebob's showcased aura color schemes:
Rainbow'ish, only applied to hair.
Orange, flame-like.
Purple, electric-like.
Ditto.
Ditto.
Black.
T.B.A.
Dynamic metamorphosis
[
]
Skebob's body can randomly change. For example, they can grow or lose wings, arms or teeth, have their proportions changed drastically, etc. The tree branch Skebob stands on can even glue/merge with theirfeet sometimes.
Unlike the next ability, though, this doesn't imply a power boost, but instead a mere visual change.
Winmaxxing
[
]
Skebob's winforce allows them to morph into stronger and/or more efficient forms in order to gain the upper hand in situations in which the winning bird is struggling.
Here are some of its transformations:
Gambler of Midas
Thunderous Wrath
Green Blaze
This transformation of Skebob's,
which can be activated by simply opening their beak
, the winning bird's body turns golden. Their luck greatly increases in this state (yes, EVEN MORE than before), though combat-wise there isn't much of an upgrade.
Without wings.
With wings.
Alternative design
.
This transformation, despite still being too weak to be considered as Skebob's true second phase, is extremly powerful nonetheless.
In this state, Skebob becomes slighty larger and a blue'ish, electric aura surrounds their body. Both their strength and speed increase, to the point Roblox_egor's base form is slighty overwhelmed by it.
It also has an alternative version, which makes Skebob shrink down to their normal size again and turns their plumage light blue, but makes them way faster. They were even capable of briefly speedblitzing base Roblox_egor.

Universes
(AKA a

).

The Green Blaze is the first transformation that is powerful enough to classify as Skebob's second phase combat-wise. Regarding the visual changes the Green Blaze makes to its user, it gives Skebob an extremly powerful green glowth, along with making their eyes glow white and lose their pupils.
When using the Green Blaze transformation, Skebob is so strong they can even give fight to Roblox_egor's
ultra form
, though still being slighty weaker than the latter. They can also morph into a more humanoid bird-like being (for some reason) when using this ability.
The Green Blaze is extremly related to the Albino Paragon transformation (which can be seen in the next section of the tabber (TBA)), as the latter is pretty much the "perfect form" of the Green Blaze.

The one "weakness" (more like a simple secondary effect) this transformation has is that it is extremly unstable. Said property is so extreme in fact, that it even makes the Green Blaze have an extra subphase, which is simply known as the second phase of it. Its only difference with the normal form is that it makes Skebob's body change its shape much quicker and in more bizarre ways, such as turning Skebob into a dodo-like behemoth, an eldritch snake-like being with a skin that has the properties of a gas and can randomly grow and degrow heads on any part of Skebob's body, etc.
Said alternative form doesn't represent a significative power increase for the winning bird's Green Blaze phase though, but more like an "enraged" version of it.

There is another cosmic entity that is similar to Skebob, known as
Skezombie

No, seriously, that's a main plot point of what the song I'm taking inspiration from says. The mango being such an important thing in it is because of said fruit being very related to brainrot memes, just like Skebob.
