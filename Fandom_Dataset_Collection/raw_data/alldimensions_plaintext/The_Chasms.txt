Strange amalgamations and entities
The Chasms are a series of holes in space present in a single verse. These holes, when entered, will bring you into a void-like space (also known as The Chasms) where strange entities roam. The Chasms do not seem to be contained within the verse which the holes are present in, due to The Chasms being much bigger than the verse.

Structure
[
]
The Chasms are a void, with occasional small objects which have fallen into the holes leading to The Chasms. Many strange creatures reside here, with some acting like a residence for smaller creatures. Many strange fleshy structures are in The Chasms, making the interior of The Chasms feel very surreal and alien.
The Creatures
[
]
The creatures inside of The Chasms are extremely strange and alien. None of them seem to be related to The
First Realm
. Here are a few notable ones.
|\|[]
[
]
|\|[] will usually be the first creature you will see when you enter the holes leading to The Chasms. This is due to it guarding and sometimes blocking the holes, preventing creatures from entering. |\|[] is very big, being over 12 LY across, and is extremely hard to kill due to its sheer size.
=/=
[
]
=/= is one of the most common creatures in The Chasms. If any information gets near it, it will start to corrupt the information and rapidly switch its
existence states
while also moving around in an unpredictable pattern. If =/= is hurt, it will slam into whatever hurt it and glitch it out of The Chasms. =/=s can be as small as 1 millimeter to over 7 kilometers wide.
+-*/
[
]
+-*/ is a strange entity, usually 10 feet long, which can manipulate matter according to the properties of basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). For example, +-*/ can take 2 groups of 3 and 9 particles, and then "divide" the two groups together to output 3 particles (9÷3=3). Due to this, +-*/
be considered a living version of the 4 basic
What Particles
. When attacked, +-*/ will move very quickly and try to fight back by firing What Particles at the attacker with extreme force. This usually does not deal much damage to the attacker, and is only to stun the enemy for a little bit to let +-*/ escape.
[[]]
[

[[]] is a giant creature

LY wide with similar looks to
The Ealer
. It cannot move, but has extremely powerful attacks which can obliterate even a |\|[] almost instantly. [[]] also can extensively alter its properties and attributes, such as its size, color, shape, collision physics, or even
Existence Rank
. [[]] is usually passive, but when provoked/attacked, it will become extremely aggressive.
[|][|]
[
]
[|][|] is the biggest creature in The Chasms. There is only 1 [|][|] in The Chasms due to its size, which is approximately

. [|][|]
can in fact move
, albeit at an extremely slow pace of about 1 meter per
OYC
. [|][|] cannot attack others or defend itself. This might be due to how [|][|] is very passive, with its mostly hollow interior acting as a safe space for other creatures in The Chasms.
___
[
]
___ is an entity which has only 3 properties: its
Existence Rank
, its size, and its collision physics. Due to this, ___ is basically invisible due to it having no colors, making it fully transparent. This has made finding ___ extremely hard. So far, ___ have been observed to be between 10 meters to over 1,000 miles.
{{}}
[
]
{{}} is a creature similar to [[]]. {{}} however, is very small and also very weak. It has little control over itself, and purposely lets other creatures manipulate it. {{}} cannot attack other creatures, but will excrete a very powerful acid if any creature tries to swallow {{}}.
