The Gods Realms
[
]
Any of these 8 gods' "homes" or "Realms" are actually their true forms, the ones you see are actually their mind creating the form they desire, this actually holds true for the
Primordial
as well, the Primordialverse being his "home" in that case, and whenever a god is 'sealed' it is actually just the Primordial cutting their link to the Primordialverse outside of their realm.
