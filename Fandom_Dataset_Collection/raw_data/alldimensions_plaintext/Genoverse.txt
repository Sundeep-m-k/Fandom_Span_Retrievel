The Genoverse - compared to most other verses - is relatively small. It contains a variety of sub-verses on its 6 dimensional surface. It is estimated to have 720 verses, very small compared to the amount of verses other ones do like the
Multiverse
. However, only a small amount of them have been well documented, due to it being located in a dangerous place.

Location

The Genoverse exists in a place known as
The Red Storm
, a 7 dimensional hyperbolic realm. Most parts of the red storm are to unstable and chaotic to even allow for the formation of 'verses', but the Genoverse happens to be in a fairly stable and calm region.
Sub-Verses
[
]
Verse α
[
]
The most simplest of all of the sub-verses, being 1-dimensional. Because of the properties of 1 dimensional space, a particle placed between these 2 other particles cannot move past either of them, and is stuck between them. This property makes it essentially impossible for complicated structures or life to develop here. Not much of interest happens here. It is approximately 15 billion years old.
Verse β
[
]
This universe possesses 2 dimensions, along with having very exaggerated hyperbolic space and time. This is due to the way matter behaves here, having little to no effect on gravity, giving strong negative (hyperbolic) curvature. This verse is approximately 5.228 billion years old
Due to the lack of gravity, there are no stars, planets or galaxies, most of the verse is made from floating gas, rocks, debris, or liquid.
Contrary to the previous verse, this verse has noticeable levels of life. Though, due to the 2-dimensionality, hyperbolicity, and lack of gravity, there are many difficulties that lifeforms present here have to face.
Verse γ
[
]
This verse is 3-dimensional, infinite in size, and has a similar matter density to our own
Universe
. There appear to be complex particle systems and dynamics going on in this verse, however there has not been a good chance to study them due to what have been called 'γ-Extreme Events'.
γ-Extreme Events are sudden very extreme periodic spikes in energy levels known only to exist inside the Verse γ that are so strong that nearly any known material is incinerated near-instantly when such an event occurs. After a γ-Extreme Event it appears that the Verse γ's particle physics changes and has a completely different system of fundamental particles after a γ-Extreme Event. These events have made studying Verse γ especially difficult, as γ-Extreme Events occur around once every 33 days (exact values have not yet been measured). Due to the nature of γ-Extreme events, this verse's age is unknowable.
Verse γ typically settles down into systems of spherical shapes after a γ-Extreme Event, which individually can be as large as our
galaxy
and as small as 30 mi in diameter. These spheres can act solid, liquid, gaseous, or a mix of all three. The former two tend to glow red, purple, or green for unknown reasons, and the amount of each color tends to change after γ-Extreme Events. No life has been found in Verse γ, likely due to the frequency of γ-Extreme Events in the verse.
