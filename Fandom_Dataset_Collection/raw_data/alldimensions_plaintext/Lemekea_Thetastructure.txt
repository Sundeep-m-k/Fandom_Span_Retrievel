Lemekea Thetastructure
What's in this sphere, hmmm?
Dimensionality
Theta-th(Theta) Mahlo Cardinal | M(Theta) (Inside of the sphere) but outside of the sphere it seems plainly three dimensional.

Containing
All verses that have the existance rank: Theta-th(Theta) Mahlo Cardinal and below.

The Wall of the Black Void
Summary: Lemekea Thetastructure is a humongous sphere with unexplainable anomalous effects that contains things that do not exist,  that super-exists and exists. This verse also contains things that seemingly non-exist then non-existance and beyond.  The sphere seems to have a 2D hypersurface,   but that's what it actually seems like because going inside the sphere entails a completly different story. "The shell" or rather the outside of the sphere is where wild things will start to become "ugly".
This extremly massives sphere contains existance ranks up to Theta-th mahlo cardinal and not over this existance rank,  this means that instead of using the first mahlo cardinal we jump up to Theta-th. That's where it got it's name from eccensially,  "Theta-structure."  Though it's bigger then Theta for sure but the main reason it is called so is because there are theta-ammount of layers.   It also contains existance ranks of Negative numbers,  anything that's over (Negative Theta Mahlo Cardinal) which is basically a negative number version out of the posetive transfinite number. However Its containment is actually inside of the sphere while it is surrounded by a hypersurface which is it's shell (obviously).  The sphere definently contains itself over and over again in layers and weirdly the layers overlapp eachother,  disappear or even re-appear in other locations within the sphere so it's easy to get lost,  there are
θ
{\displaystyle \theta}
layers that it contains itself with,  it has similar containment methods to "
The Box
" but it's slightly different,  or maybe even more.
Lemekea Thetastructure can be described as a semi-blackhole structure because it has a singularity in it's "core." so called which is constantly destroying the layers within it in extremely slow rates,  but the structure regenerates it as fast as it disappears so we can say it has acheived an equalibrium. Each layer contains different verses,  but the fun fact is that the hypersurfaces do not display anything from this massive structure but the problem is that this hypersurface is a event horizion and there is no light coming out of it.
What does it look like when you're going inside? Also what is it made of?

As the observer approaches the "invisible"sphere ,  nothing much really happens other then the observer getting closer to it.  Though when just at the brink of touching the hypersurface which is pure darkness by the way,  things begin to loop around as if the darkness begins to swollow one whole. The observer's velocity increases while seemingly entering the surface and the duration is just one yoktosecond. Under that time you would have been accelerated to Aleph_Theta speed.  The speed which one would "decend." increases so rapidly that the observer will not realise it.
In just a split of a yoctosecond they'd be inside darkness.  However,  as soon as one is inside it. It would have looked like a new they'd entered a fractal-like verse where objects that super - exist,  and non-exist and things that do exist are contained in it.  Before they had entered,  the observer would had seen  a line across their vision and that tiny sliver of light was the reflection of everything below existance ranks of the verse but then they'd be sent into seemingly an other dimension that is contained by the sphere.
They'd see weird fractal structures. Some of them are in superposition,  in a state of existance and non-existance at the same time. However,  some re-appear and disappear. These fractal structures are what the Thetastructure is made out of. "Neucloidic Matter."  no not Nuclic matter but Neucloid.
It's a type of matter that actually contains verses of what the Thetastructure could hold. However,  anything that higher then existance rank  (Theta-th mahlo cardinal.) can actually exit this sphere and can break it's containment,  but then you'd be in a higher plane of existance.  This acts as a container  for absoloutly every single thing below it's rank.  However,  the lowest limit of what it can contain is MINUS THETA-TH MAHLO CARDINAL. So it contains a WHOLE veriety of things and even "Sub-existant things.".  Even [

times over and over again which proves how increadibly dense this matter is,  but also how increadible it's usage is for storing massive objects of any size as long it matches it's existance rank. This sphere contains exotic matter that can contain the very fabric of existance itself(In the existance ranks Theta th-Mahlo cardinal and below.)  Now,  compare that to the sphere's actual size and try to multiply the entire volume compared to it's matter,  oh no you can't because it's way too huge and it's impossible to do that...Unless if you're some omnipotent god or some sorts.
Each layer is a copy of itself but with different locations,  configurations and literally everything you'd imagine,  because as it contains itself over and over again there is always new things to discover.
Understanding the singularity:
[
]
The closer you get to the singularity,  the faster you'd travel towards it,  matter gets denser around you until there is a point where you'd be compressed into a tiny point and obliterated. The only way to safely travel through the singularity is that you'd need to be a higher rank of existance to go through it without obliteration. (It needs to be higher then the Lemekea Thetastructure).
Explaining the equation:
(if I am correct...)
As X approaches Infinity,  so will 1/X approach 0 is what it means,  So the space is getting increasingly smaller,  and the observer would go faster as well until it reaches 0 (which is never as you'd be compressed so much that you'd be non-existant,   then you'd be more then that and yeaaah you'd never reach 0,  you can reach VERY close though and it definently can approach transfinite ordinals. (  LIM = Limit.)  What this is trying to say is that it approaches 0 forever without ever actually stopping.  It's a continous approach.
Or by other words,   the limit of 1/X is 0,   as X approaches infinity.  It's just a way of making things increasingly smaller and approach 0 at the same time!  But it will never become 0,  as I said it will approach it as close as possible (and that's pretty much forever.).
The singularity swollows everything,   you know the verses and so on.  Everything will meet it's demise,   but everything will also meet it's rebirth and that's why new matter is created as it is destroyed so it will pretty much never run out... I suppose that's the purpose of this verse. HOWEVER,  for everything to move 1 planck length to the singularity  it takes
θ
{\displaystyle \theta}
years to do so so that's how slow it is and it's probabaly safe enough to say...It's a very long time and you shouldn't think about it.  Also,  this is for the verses that are contained inside of the thetastructure.
Qoute:  "It will meet the singularity...In time..."
