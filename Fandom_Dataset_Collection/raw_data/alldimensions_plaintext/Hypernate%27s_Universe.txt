The Bots
[
]
In the past of this universe, the Bots were built by the universe's version of
Humans
, but humanity built shapes, a von neumann probe, then expanded out of their universe.
In the present, the Shapes have expanded to most of the universe,
and the bots are now volatile, and could explode when people talk about their past. (
Mee1234
), with the previous pilots of their universe more stable, and don't explode, and instead just walk it off.
The bots went extinct, now only being found in robotics sanctuary, faraway from this multiverse.
The bots, previously known as Hypernates, thought "Hypernate" was a cool name, until they learned the
Ultimate Truth
, so now they refer to eachother as bots.
Accidents
[

Typion Accident
[
]
A Reactor failure caused
Typions
to shoot out from the universe, but the bots were cautious, and placed a shield that protected the reactor from the
Interdimensional Void
, while also protecting the universe they live in.
Interdimensional War
[
]
They opened many portals to different universes to colonize them, but some already had life inside, They abandoned those bases.
One war had living tissue boxes attack with tissues made of antimatter, this devestated many colonies.
Another had anthropomorphic dogs, we will never get to this war, it was dark, but it caused this universe to be shielded and locked away forever.
The last war had most of the colonies wiped from existence, which caused the bots to evacuate from the surviving bases to their home universe in MGA-992.
Yeah baby! Mee1234 revamped!
