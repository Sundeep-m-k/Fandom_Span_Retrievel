Le Archverse
[
]
Le Archverse is the real version of the
Archverse,
which contains all of Tuop's creations, and everything smaller than itself. It is superseded by a higher level of quasicosmology that is being produced by higher iterations of Tuop. It also contains the Metaweb.

hevin and hel are good and bad places that things sometimes go 2 4 no reason at all.
this chain goes on for LONG. it is constantly growing so that nothing can be bigger than it.
