A tiling (or sometimes called as a "tessellation") is the covering of a plane using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. They can also be generalized into higher dimensions, just like polytopes.

Euclidean Tilings
[
]
Below are quick definitions of the 3 possible euclidean one-polygon 2-dimensional tilings.
Triangular Tiling
[
]
Triangular tiling
is a
plane
filled with
triangles
. It has the
Schläfli symbol
{3, 6} and is the
dual
of the hexagonal tiling.
Square Tiling
[
]
Square tiling
is a plane filled with squares. It has the Schläfli symbol {4, 4}.
Hexagonal Tiling
[
]
Hexagonal
tiling is one of the three regular tilings of the plane and consists of an infinite number of
hexagons
. It has a Schläfli symbol of {6, 3}, meaning that it has three
hexagons
located around each vertex.
Spherical Tilings
[
]
Regular spherical tilings are just the Platonic Solids.
Hyperbolic Tilings
[
]
There are an
infinite
amount of regular Hyperbolic Tilings, because these are the tilings that are not euclidean or spherical.
Order-5 square tiling
[
]
The Order-5 square tiling has a Schläfli symbol of {4, 5}. It can be thought of as a "hyperbolic cube".
Order-3 heptagonal tiling
[
]
The Order-3 heptagonal tiling has a Schäfli symbol of {7, 3}. It can be thought of as a "hyperbolic dodecahedron".
