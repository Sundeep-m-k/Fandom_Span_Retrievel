A 3D projection of The Final Omega-loop, i literally couldnt add it to the infobox
(I hope no one complains about this like if you complain just contribute) The Final Omega-loop is the last Omega-loop. Once it explodes, everything from
The Omega-loops Collection of all Omega-loops of all Omega-loops
to the
Universe
will explode. So sad i cant add images to the infobox, also i used the correct infobox but lets keep on.
It keeps expanding, but has a limit.
Again you can contribute, and add more info.
