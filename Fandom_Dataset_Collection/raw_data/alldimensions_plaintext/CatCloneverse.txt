The origin of the CatCloneverse
[
]
The origin starts in 1945, somewhere in August. There's a cat named "Meowzy", that will request pets (Meow) very often. Once, while the owner is sleeping, it meowed so much it split into two cats, completely identical. The day after, when the owner was sleeping, it became 12, than 45, than 250. The owner supposedly died when the cats became 250. At that point they were the size of a house. Around a week later, they became a almost perfect sphere, the size of a city in all dimensions. (At the time it was still 3 dimensions), and most people escaped. 3 weeks after, it was the size of the state. Almost nobody escaped. Only 4 days later, it was the size of a country. After a day, it was the size of the continent. After slightly under a day, it was the size of the planet. At this point, the cats were immortal. After a month, they were the size of the solar system. After a season, they were the size of the galaxy arm, and after a week, they were the size of the galaxy. I'm gonna stop cause this is getting boring.
