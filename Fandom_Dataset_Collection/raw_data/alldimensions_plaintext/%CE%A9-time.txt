Infinite layers of time
[
]
There are infinite temporal dimensions that you are experiencing all at once, requiring you to be more powerful than the previous to travel through, All of them have branches, and singular instance of each layer containing all instances of the previous.
first is X-time, or THE time, it is very common to travel through it.
then Y-time, then Z-time, then W-time, ect.
Y-time alone solves the grandfather’s paradox.
Ω-time

]
Ω-time is the only temporal dimension that you can’t travel through, it isn’t one of the layers, it CONTAINS them. You can only travel forward.
