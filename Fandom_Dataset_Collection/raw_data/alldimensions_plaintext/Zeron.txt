Zyorons
and
-s
aren't enough. What it actually does is what positivity cancels out with negativity and other non-binary signs. Extensions to nulls and signs are extensions to zeroes. Signless logic and hyperzeroes are what goes inbetween.

Zerons
are zero particles found in
Nontubials
. They both hold and look like the extents of zeroes like
nulls
and undefined. They're also the smallest-possible Xi particle, and are least restricted to propertyless.
Zero
[
]
Zero is a central state for values. As mostly signless, the trijective sign for it is 0. It represents the true center of a Nontubial's polar field, and uses abstraction of nullity to approach.
Nullology mathematics
designated it as high-level.
Combining with equal pairs of +s and -s or 0s will result in hyperzeroes. Hyperzeroes are found far away from zero, and hold alt-nulls. The abstract signs are also reducible to more signless ones, pushing into hyperzeroes. These signs are intertwinning, infinitary logic, and are operators themselves.
Nontubodynamics
[

Zerons can freely self-merge, along for the conversion of zeroic energy. Interacting with something else will dissipate like addition. The form of Zeroic Energy is that the value holds the Zeron's zero. Zeroic energy can't be created nor destroyed, and has a net of zero.
There's another kind called Decoy Zerons. By +/- pair equality, they rarely hold zeroic energy, and consists of
Kicsi
particles. Set of zeroes form the highest extents of hyperzeroes, as really abstract as undistinguishable to 0. It's a reason why Nontubial gives polarity. As they hold more hyperzeroes than zero, it is more common.
