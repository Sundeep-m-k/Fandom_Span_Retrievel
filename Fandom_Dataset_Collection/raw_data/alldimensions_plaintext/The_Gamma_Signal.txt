The Gamma Signal is a extremely powerful signal. The Gamma Signal gets its name from gamma ray burst, because of tremendous power of the signal. Only 34 confirmed Gamma Signals exist, but many others could have destroyed uncivilized planets. Gamma Signals also have odd patterns, and completely change direction in seconds.

First encounter
[
]
The first encounter of a Gamma Signal ended in destruction of many people in a large civilization, and created a
closeverse
, a verse that uses all materials to defend itself.
Using power
[
]
Only one civilization is using the power of the Gamma Signal. Anything and everything that was tested against the Gamma Signal was destroyed, including galaxies and black holes. Before testing, a new element, called
gammatine
, was discovered. It is still relatively unknown, since the civilization who discovered it has not tested much of the element.
Signals

This will list important signals, and what impact they had through a message created by a civilization nearby or destroyed by a Gamma Signal. (All of these letters where in different languages, translated to English)

(First Signal)
"A odd force is nearby. Star systems and planets are vanishing by the second, a force faster than time itself. We aim our tech to this ungodly thing and test it. We have confirmed it is a strong, invisible force, we think it could be a signal. It is also moving oddly, like it's... w-what? It... it completely turned around. It's pointing... at us!? No... no, that's... that's not possible... h-how? How close is it to us, can we see? How long do..." The page continues, but the rest is in atomic pieces, and has yet to be put together again. The horrified civilizations in the verse the came from assumed that a evil god sent a Gamma Signal to destroy them. In the fear and chaos, they closed the verse from access after the Gamma Signal silenced. They had created a
closeverse
, a verse that uses all materials harvested to protect itself from outside forces.

(Where it got its name)
"We were told by our overlords to prepare for "total annihilation." We didn't understand this message, since they never fearmonger, but we prepared nonetheless. We saw what they meant only a few [human] years later, when a message was written across the sky in a dark red, saying "ARMAGEDDON IS HERE." The dark sky grew darker, stars across the sky going black. "Did the degenerate era come early?" No, it hadn't. We aimed every one of our twenty seven thousand telescopes to random stars. A nearby town shouts loud enough to be heard light years away and still be deafening. One of the telescopes took a video at 2,000,000 frames per second, and caught this evil. We immediately rushed to our Universal Organisation Peoples[, the people who defend the civilization,] to warn them of this threat. "Ah, yes, we had foreseen something like this..." We concluded that it was a powerful signal, we call it a "Gamma Signal." This signal has been gone for 934 [Earth] years now. We hope to soon capture this power, and test it against several objects. Imagine the power of this signal, it may destroy all in its path..."

14 (First capture of the signal)
"We have encountered a "Gamma Burst," a first for us. It seems to be coming nearby, [REDACTED]. get the sphere, we need to catch it! I will come back to my writings soon, I don't... have much to say about this. Up and ready! Hold, hold... hold...... YES! We trapped it, it's ours! Now, let's see what's in this thing... Em... Huh... We don't have that one. Is this a new element? Oh, it is! We'll call it...
Gammatine
, [REDACTED], learn about this new element, we need to experiment!"

14.5 (Tests for power)
"We have gathered enough information about this element, and... we are afraid to publicly release this information. It's power... is to strong to trust other civilizations with. We tested it on galaxies, black holes, and even the strongest of metals, but it cuts through everything like a knife in a cake... We have added this to our tech, but we oath to never allow this tech to escape our verse, it's just to powerful... What would happen to everyone if this information got out? This secret shall be kept here 'till the end of time." This comes from the same civilization as seen above. None of this new technology has left the verse yet, they are still the only ones who know that this type of technology exists.
