About
[
]
Oni
is an
Omni
-
God
that tries to use and access the
Hierarchical Tunnels
and ascends even past them.
He was the wielder of the Creation and Destruction Gem, one of the
Primordial Shards
, though they don't seem to be important right now. This is not exactly great news to Oni; however,
he
is doing other things to keep himself busy, such as trying to contact and befriend the
Bat-GOD
, even though the latter doesn't show interest.
Oni is thus a lonely
entity
, trying to do whatever he can to befriend and meet other cosmic entities like him, that are on his power level or even higher above it. His quest to do so has him trying to understand, unsuccessfully meet and even try to be more powerful than
post
Alphasmic
level
beings
. This has caused him to create the
planet
Galifearthon
which travels across
Multiverses
on accident as a
rogue planet
.
Creation
[
]
Oni was created by
Bean Man
as a way to counteract the doings of the
End-Be-All Cult
and to restore order to the Official Hierarchy's
verses
. Oni was originally fully controlled by his creator, but soon gained sentience and started to become extremely powerful by himself, soon becoming as strong as a Supreme God.
Powers
[
]
Oni is an extremely powerful god, being capable of altering hierarchies to its own vision. It can also contact and interact with verses not part of any hierarchy. This lets him also escape most Alphasm's imaginations. Despite that, the average Alphasm is still physically stronger and more capable than Oni, so the latter could be risking their own life if he's unfortunate enough to stumble upon beings such as the
Rexagloxyverse
.
