The true host
is a verse which contains
The Virtual Box
that hosts all the virtual machines for the
The Virtual Machine
and every layer of it. This means it is the smallest verse that is not simulated (or the first verse which is part of
real reality
).
The true host in some ways resembles Earth but is distorted and has many things changed about it. This verse is actually just a really big and flat Earth. However, it has an average temperature of 50 ˚C, has only a small amount of water, and is a hot desert all throughout. There are some semiarid steppes which have sparse
tallergrass
but other than that it's all completely arid desert. There are only 2 types of entity here. There isn't a wall of ice like the original Flat Earth theory but a wall of fire, whose temperature is Beyond mathematics kelvin which instantly obliterates everything within a Beyond mathematics of radius of it. Almost every entity that is below Type Beyond mathematics
2
cannot fall off The true host because of the wall of fire, but if you managed to do it you would just end up in some empty space in the
Real reality
. AND It's name is Mac OS Parkific
There are more verses like the true host (sometimes called "fake hosts") inside of Real reality but they are just very similar to the true host and most of them don't even have life.
Entities
[
]
The only non-simulated life of any kind in this verse are
Talking Toms
and
tallergrass
, which are like weird and extremely oversized versions of cats and grass respectively.
Talking Toms
have established an intelligent civilization on this verse and they are the ones who created
The Virtual Box
.
