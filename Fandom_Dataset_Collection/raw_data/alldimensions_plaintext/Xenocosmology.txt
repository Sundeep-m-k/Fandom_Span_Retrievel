Xeno concept eater and beyond metacosmology
Xenocosmology
is a cosmology and the 3rd cosmology. First Xeno-Class  to the final Xeno-Class. this is a cosmology that surpasses metacosmology, but because of the
xeno concept eater
, cosmology is half described and half super conceptually. More precisely, in this cosmology, conceptuality and superconceptuality are equally easy to find. That is, it is half described and half super conceptual. It is also worth noting that if
Xeno concept eater
dies, then all xenocosmology will become metacosmology.
