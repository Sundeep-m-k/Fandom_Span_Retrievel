The
Final Ultraverse
is a verse that contains The Final Ultraverse and other verses of similar properties to the
Ultraverses
. Just like how The Final Multiverse looks very similar to a normal
Multiverse
, for each
Ultraverse
there is a verse extremely similar to it, in fact an infinite number of each (including the
Omniverse
). The actual structure of The Final Ultraverse does not actually resemble the same appearance of any known
Ultraverse
, almost looking like a random bundle of different verses.
Structure
[
]
The structure of The Final Ultraverse is not
all
, however. When observed closer, the smaller verses are usually split into 3 portions:
Combination: Many of the Final Ultraverses'
Ultraverses
are packed tightly together, forming a dense combination of these verses.
Fractal: These portions form a fern fractal sort of shape of specific verses, all interlinked together to form strange and interesting structures. All of them almost form a network of Internet-like complexity of these verses.
Negative capacity: Here is a structure similar to the packing structure,
however
, it mostly has many long void-like holes interweaving through the centre of The Final Ultraverse, making up most of it's black hole-like appearance.
