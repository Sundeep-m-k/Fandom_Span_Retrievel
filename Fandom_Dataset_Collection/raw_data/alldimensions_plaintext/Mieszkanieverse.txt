Mieszkanieverse
(originally Mieszkaniewiat) and abbreviated Mieszverse, is the smallest 2D
universe
in the
multiverse
. It was discovered by a polish astronomer called Waslè Kwanłastę in 2139, but the name "Mieszkaniewiat" comes from the junction of the polish words "Mieszkanie" (flat) and "Wiat" (verse).
Sadly, its size is decreasing 17.61 kLY per 1 billion years. And it has 32.55 billion years, but its decreasing period came 4.1 billion years after its formation. So, Mieszverse lost 501 kLY in total.
Also, its galaxies have weird shapes.
