Classica
[
]
Classica is a large land mass covering ~13% of Dubworld. It is the continent that the first dubbians came from and is also the largest. The residents live in cottage style architecture and ride around in steam powered ornithopters. People here can be extremely gifted musically but can also be stuck up. They have been known to colonize other countries in Dubworld and berate the music there, targeting Poppia in particular.
Poppia
[
]
Poppia is a more recent civilization whose residents live in large domes and silos for homes. Cities are made out of hundreds of different gemstones and there is color beyond color here. Everyone has a device like a radio which plays a new song everytime they wake up so they won't listen to the same song over and over and have things get boring. Poppia lacks the more erudite sophistication of Classica but is the best fashion-wise.
Dubland
[
]
Dubland is a rocky land full of caverns and rocks perched at the edge of cliffs. When these rocks drop they fall over natural hollows in the Earth which ring out like a bell in tones of 0.2 to 40 Hz. These reach over 130 dB and are called "bass drops." The residents live in single-story buildings due to quakes and are hunter gatherer nomads. Dubland is famous for
basshunters
, which are wolves that live off pure sound energy.
Ambiville

Ambiville is a foggy country about 5,000,000 km

filled with gently chiming wind bells, aimless flutes, and constant drones emitted by the
stellar drone
. This is a bird that is known to do nothing but hum for hours a day. It takes it's power from the stars, each bird siphons energy from the core of its star. They are near immortal. Few people live here.
