EK-X (Egg Kings)
[
]
EK-X is a term used to describe any given tier of Egg King, robot like beings who avenge (or attempt to avenge) the destruction of cosmoeggs. For example, one of these beings are called the EK-2. EK-2, while the third weakest class of Egg King, is already very powerful compared to other cosmic entities. Additionally, every advancement of Egg King is a plane of existence or more (depending on how broad that plane is) higher than the previous. So if a certain EK-4 was on a multiversal level, an EK-3 in the same hierachy would be on a universe level. This page will be expanded soon.

EK--1
[
]
EK--1 is the only EK-X that is visible to humans. They are roughly the size of a large star, and look like a cosmoegg, except considerably bigger of course. There are many trillions appearing in the multiverse and immediately being killed by the anti-mladics. They are summoned by the destruction of cosmoeggs, which is an event with multiple occurences each planck time.
EK-0 (or mini EK-1)
[
]
EK-0 are created by the destruction of anything smaller than a multiverse that produces eggs. The EK-0 characteristically has 3 "cannons" on the top of its body, which fire cosmoeggs with properties slightly different to standard ones. These cosmoeggs contain a void that is too unstable to exist for more than 1 day OYC. This causes them to detonate upon touching any stable matter, or after 1 day OYC. These detonations are powerful enough to shake universes, hence the EK-0 are avoided by most multiversal beings, and worshipped as a god in many universes.
