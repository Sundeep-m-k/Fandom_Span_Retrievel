The Geraldson 9-21 System is a trinary
star system
that consists of two
ronnagiants
(Geraldson 9-21 A and B) and a
purple quettagiant
(Geraldson 9-21 C). Geraldson 9-21 A and B are in a binary system orbiting Geraldson 9-21 C. Orbiting Geraldson 9-21 C are over 118,000 objects, 100,000 of them being
planets
and 10,000 being
stars
with 8,000 other planets orbiting them. The system is in the
Local Universe Group
, just outside the Universal Neighborhood. It is located right above Barnard's Loop in Orion. It has an apparent magnitude of 43 so it is way too faint to be seen even with the JWST. It is being gravitationally lensed by GL-1.

Objects Orbiting the System
[
]
Not only are there over 100,000 planets orbiting the Geraldson 9-21 system directly, but there are also around 10,000 stars orbiting the system too. Some of these stars also have 2-3 planets orbiting them
[

]
, bringing the total of planets up to ~108,000 planets in this system.
Stars / Stellar Objects
[
]
The stars orbiting the Geraldson System range from red dwarves (the most likely, at 20,000) up to green
kilogiants
(Only 3 found, being Geraldson 9-21 K1 to K3). There are also some
neutron stars
and even
quark stars
in the system. Suprisingly, there are also 10
black holes
.
Planets
[
]
The ~108K planets are also very varied in their own right. There are 40,000 rocky planets and 58,000 gas giants. It is expected that these numbers rise in the future because the furthest
asteroid belt
(B-256) was destabilized since the
hypergiant
keeping it from collapsing into thousands of new planets went supernova. The closest object is the planet
Uilorke
at only 1 lightyear from Geraldson 9-21 C, being over 2,000,000,000ºC (2 billion). The farthest object was the hypergiant
Quagmirus
, at 2,240,412 lightyears from G9-21C until it went supernova. The largest planet is
Yuonis
, at 770 Mm in size.
Notable Planets:
Uilorke, the closest planet at 1 light-year
Yuonis, the largest planet, compared to Jupiter
Monyui
, the home of the species that constructed
Akalor
243 million years ago
Asteroid Belts
