The Quarkverse is a verse full of quarks of various sizes. It was created when a
Universe
collided with the
The Spaghetti Bridge
, transforming matter into quarks and scattering quarks throughout size and structure.
This verse's matter is 99% quarks, 0.09% gluons, and 0.01% leptons. The chunks that have leptons typically have long polymers, like some plastics and proteins, allowing life to form. Also, there are more than 6 color forces here, with there being over 10
100
color forces in this -verse. Each of them has unique interactions with the other over 9.9999... duotrigintillion color forces.
Some life has managed to harvest various flavors of quarks in order to make a "physics gun".  This works by shooting certain types of gluons/quarks at an object to attract/repel it. The quarks/gluons are usually the size of a egg, so they can attract/repel pretty far.
A really giant quark/gluon has been found in the Quarkverse, and it has been used by Quarkversians to propel themselves out of the Quarkverse into the
Teraverse
.
