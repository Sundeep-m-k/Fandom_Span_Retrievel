Ejected particles come from the
smallverse
. These particles being very small can clump together to form bigger particles. If enough particles merge, they become clusters. One cluster is 1.5 inches long.
Creation

Ejected particles form in the center of the vortex and are pushed out byÂ ???? these particles only live for a 10^73 years until they fizzle out into space. In their lifetimes they also consumer matter in space (matter that is smaller than them.) they matter makes them grow by 0.1 nanometers
