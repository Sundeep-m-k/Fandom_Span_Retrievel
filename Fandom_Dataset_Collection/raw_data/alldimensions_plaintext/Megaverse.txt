Megaverses
are the fourth unofficial layer of
Archverses
, following
Universes
,
Multiverses
and
Kiloverses
. While our Megaverse is about 6.81 sextillion ly, which is actually quite small, some Megaverses can be bigger than
Xenoverses
!
Megaverses contain fragments of the
Inforiumverse
, which contains mainly
Inforium
. Inforium is similar to
Lawium
in that it can prevent chaos, but differs in that it is also one of the main forces holding spirals and densely packed verses together, which include many
Extended Divergent Archverses
.
Inforium
may also retain some information from its previous verse, the
Inforiumverse
, and so Multiverses have been known to take on the physical laws of the
Inforium
that covers it.
Another thing that megaverses contain extremely rarely is
Cuanday
- a
cuandaic
element - where 1 atom of it appears every 492,124,000 cubed lightyears.
One thing that is able to destroy Megaverses is
Red holes
, which one atom sized one can destroy the amount of atoms in the Megaverse, making it impossible to exist.
Megaverses are fractal structures, which is described below.

Structure
[
]
Megaverses contain fractal structures, each consisting of 10 identical structures, but with a bit smaller, but different sizes. 3 children form a spiral with 2 lines while 7 other children can be found anywhere that is further away. However, those 7 children were formed 5 iterations later than those other 3 children. With a Megaversal-scale gravitational force, all of those 10 structures seem to swirl clockwise from the center.
Megaverses commonly have 70 - 90 iterations in common, although rare Megaverses have up to 120 iterations. At the center, it is a chaotic place, so most children are replaced with
Multiverses
, but on the outside, it repeatedly nests until it is the size of a Multiverse. Unlike other verses, there is no space-bending to allow more matter to fit in less. The repeating spirals just get smaller.
In a spiral, there's alot of
Inforium
at the center, forming force fields that affect all children of that spiral. Those fields then give laws and executions to them, differing on the size of that spiral. Inforium is actually a huge cluster of
Source particles
, consisting of pseudo-random clusters of
Primordium Sigma
and
Primordium Omega
(depending on the original
Inforiumverse
), with a lot of chaos particles.
Formation
[
]
During the formation of the
Gigaverse
, the
Gigaverse
is so hot that chaos particles can easily pass through the
Inforiumverse
. However, those particles will bounce off when they reach the surface again, making Lawium expand permanently. Eventually, chaos particles will accelerate a lot.
12 billion years later, when some chaos particles reached the speed limit for a
Gigaverse
, which is 1 quintillion light years per second, enough to split the
Inforiumverse
into portions. One portion will become some
Inforium
, giving a Inforium Cloud to a lot of chaos particles. Then, 99% of chaos particles will be sent into smaller
Inforiumverse
substaces while 1% escapes. Every 216 million years, this process repeats for lower iterations.
At the formation of the highest layer, a Megaverse has been formed as a
Absolute Verse
. Around 1 - 2 billion years later, the centers and
Inforium
will become
Multiverses
and higher-level
Archverses
, which ends the complete formation of a Megaverse.
In other media
[

In "The Elementals", the Megaverse is a 6-8 dimensional construct containing an infinite number of Multiverses. ??? had stated that even he's not powerful enough to have control over the Megaverse, despite his insane strength. This is because he is only 5 dimensional. However, he can travel through the Megaverse via 6th-dimensional portals, if only to bridge Multiverses together along a 6th-dimensional axis. A Cosmic traveler has journeyed to another Megaverse, which is named the Altan Megaverse.
