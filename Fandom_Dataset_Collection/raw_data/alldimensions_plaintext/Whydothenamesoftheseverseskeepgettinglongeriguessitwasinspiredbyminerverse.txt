I really don't know why the names in these verses get longer and longer. Maybe it was inspired by a certain other chain. That chain had stuff like Timemachineissupercoolsoiamgoingtogetoneverse, and the names kept getting longer.
I feel like these verses kept getting longer and longer because it was inspired by that. But who made those verses?
It was
MinersHavenM43
. It definitely was. He was the one who decided to make the Timemachineissupercoolsoiamgoingtogetoneverse. He definitely inspired the creator to make this verse. Even though these verses have very long names, it was still Miner who inspired those names, and he is pretty coolÂ :)
