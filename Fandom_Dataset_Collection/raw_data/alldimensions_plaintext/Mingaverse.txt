"Home to the
VERY
creatively-named Sesrevagnim. Wow, I wonder where they got the name for that?"
! WARNING 2 !
Even with a UNTC or even ULTC, if you try and spend any time in the Goo you will immediately die.
A Mingaverse is a cluster of
Nenaverses
. A very large one, at that. The Mingaverse is about 10
2400
times larger than the
Nenaverse
, which is INSANE. While the
Sesrevagnim
may be considered a seperate EDA (Extended Divergent Archverse).
The Mingaverses are full of a substance called the GOO. The Goo is full of
Sesrevagnim
, and these
Sesrevagnim
swirl around at immense speeds. In fact, if a
Sesrevagnim
was scaled down to human speed, it would be travelling at 1,408 times the speed of light. This makes collisions very common, and so the
Sesrevagnim’s
walls are very strong. But we’ll get to that later. This also makes the Goo very high energy, and Goo Generators are usually how Mingaverse-controlling civilizations obtain their power. This also makes the Mingaverse an incredibly harsh place to live in.

These
Sesrevagnim
may actually be swirling for a good reason. Attempts to stabilize them have resulted in them breaking apart into their constituent
Nenaverses
. These
Nenaverses
are usually either absorbed by the Goo,
Sesrevagnim
or are further smashed to bits. This may just be because of their inertia, though, or it could be essentail to stabilize their gravity. We don’t know. However, sources say it’s probably both.
Due to this, there are seldom structures in the Mingaverse.
Sesrevagnim
[
]
Sesrevagnim are the plural of Esrevagnim. As you may or may not have guessed, Sesrevagnim is Nenaverses in reverse. A Sesrevagnim is like a
Nenaverse
, but unlike our
Universe
and the
Nenaverse
, there are particles similar to ‘preons’, a point particle that makes up all matter. As you may have guessed,
Nenaverses
are these preons, and their outer layer may be positively charged or negatively charged.
These
Nenaverses
then give the elementary particles their charge and their mass. The Esrevagnim is also alot like our
Universe
, similar laws of nature, similar everything. There are no black holes in the Esrevagnim though. However, there is Esrevagnite. This is generally just an incredibly energy dense particle, and is made when
Nenaverses
are mashed too close. Instead of a black hole forming, a chunk of Esrevagnite forms.
However, not all Sesrevagnim are like this, though. Some Sesrevagnim are incredibly stable, and some, are incredibly unstable. The laws of nature may be the same, but
Glitchonicite
and other stresses and errors may cause the Esrevagnim to become incredibly unstable. If the border of an Esrevagnim is broken, usually from the inside, the Goo may seep in and destroy whatever is left. These stray walls may be useful for Mingaverse controlling civilizations (as they are valuable, wholewalls are priced much higher) but are also a nuisance for civilizations attempting to cross between Sesrevagnim, as you will read in the next section.
How do you Colonise the Mingaverse?
[
]
So how do you escape or move in the Mingaverse? Well, once a civilization escapes their Nenaverse and goes into the Sesrevagnim and learn how to mine Nenaversite (not mingum, this is the border of the Nenaverse), they can build a
BMngTC
. The outer layer is made of ENRICHED NenaVERSITE. Enriched Nenaversite is usualy made with compressed Nenaversite, some Esrevagnite and some Mingum. Usually, you will have to have incredibly advanced technology to time and aim at a Sesrevagnim when it is close. In a BNTC, this is usually something like an ALT&PM. You could also use some tech to pull them together, like Gravitonium. Using the INSTANT WARP feature (first installed in
BMTCs
), through the boundary and get ready to be lonely for a while, as these patches are still very, very, very, very, very, very, large. Deaths do occur, often due to the target Sesrevagnim being too inhospitable. The image you see is a cross-section of the Sesrevagnim, but we can almost never know what’s inside. Even
Hyperphotons
are blocked.
