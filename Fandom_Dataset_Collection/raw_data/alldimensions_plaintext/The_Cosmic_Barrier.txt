The Cosmic Barrier
is a barrier that is approximately 1030 LY thick. The barrier stretches around the whole
Randomverse
and constantly changes shape and size to contain the Randomverse. The material that The Cosmic Barrier's made out of is a combination of TREEYUM, dark matter, and sponge matter from the
'thingy'
. It is currently unknown how the material got out so far. The Barrier is also very elastic. That might be the reason why the Randomverse hasn't ripped apart this barrier yet.
