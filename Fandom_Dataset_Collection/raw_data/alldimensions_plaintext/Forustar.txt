Forustars
are a type of star inside
Toriverses
. They are the primary emission of light within toriverses, and they emit different wavelengths of light depending on how they are formed.
Formation
[
]
Forustars are formed from multiple
Möbiverses
and
Kleinverses
crashing together randomly, creating a soup of small interacting Möbiverses, which create light.

Forustar giants
These stars are always in the middle of toriverses. Their formation is currently unknown. Forustar giants, although similar, are classified as different from normal forustars, and have a much larger maximum size, upwards of

km in diameter. It turns out thet they're large enough for
moquark
decay to occur, the main reason they are classified differently.
Foruholes
After a long enough time, forustars become foruholes, which are similar to black holes, except these are also in 4D, and also these are formed out of different forces. Two Möbiverses crashing together near one creates a Kleinverse.
Footnote 1: Because the light reaction isn't based on fusion, most Forustars aren't that hot.
