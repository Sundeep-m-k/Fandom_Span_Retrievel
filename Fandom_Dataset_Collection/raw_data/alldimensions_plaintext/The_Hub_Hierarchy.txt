The
Hub Hierarchy
(THH, not to be confused with the other
THH
) is an unofficial
hierarchy
ranking the objects equal to or greater than the TCHFAPOTW in size.
Due to the immense size of the objects in the
Meta-Hierarchy
, we need a new system of measuring objects, the Hub Class. Based on the Meta-Class system from previous hierarchies, the Hub Class is far bigger than any quantity of Meta-Classes. The difference between a leap from a Meta-Class to a bigger Meta-Class is vastly smaller than the leap from a Meta-Class to a bigger Hub Class.

The Hub Hierarchy is one of the most powerful voids, because it is only 0.00001% matter, and the 'matter' is just letters. Fill in the void by
