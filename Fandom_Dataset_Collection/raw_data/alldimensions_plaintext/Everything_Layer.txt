Everything Layers
are the name given to verses/dimensions/realms/areas which are the setting of very different parts of the AD cosmology. As a rule, Everything Layers also indirectly contain the one before them and are indirectly contained by the one after them.
An editor who adds a new Everything Layer must make sure that said Everything Layer is of significance to a unique section of the wiki and follows the rules above.
For ease of communication, the term
{
∞
}
x
{\displaystyle \{\infty\}_{x}}
can be used to indicate the (x+1)th Everything Layer, and
{
∞
}
x
,
y
{\displaystyle \{\infty\}_{x,y}}
to indicate a verse lower level in containment then
{
∞
}
x
,
y
+
1
{\displaystyle \{\infty\}_{x,y+1}}
, and higher level in containment then
{
∞
}
x
,
y
−
1
{\displaystyle \{\infty\}_{x,y-1}}
.
{
∞
}
x
,
0
{\displaystyle \{\infty\}_{x,0}}
is also equal to
{
∞
}
x
{\displaystyle \{\infty\}_{x}}
.
Nothing can reach
{
∞
}
ω
{\displaystyle \{\infty\}_{\omega}}
, due to the fact that the All-Dimensions Wiki can only hold a finite number of different parts of AD cosmology, even if there is way more out there. Therefore, we couldn't go beyond Everything Layers, as we couldn't make infinite pages in this wiki.
For the same reason, nothing can reach
{
∞
}
−
ω
{\displaystyle \{\infty\}_{-\omega}}
. However, non-real number numbered Everything Layers can be in the AD wiki if they use a concept differing from traditional containment, and they are finitely numbered.

Antitwentieth everything layer
[
]
True nothing
- The smallest known object in this wiki.
Anti nineteenth everything layer
[
]
Nothingest
- The smallest non-particle in -3 class.
Antieighteenth everything layer
[
]
Smalleston
- The smallest non-conceptual thing and container of all non-particles.
Antiseventeenth everything layer
[
]
Conceptual Gate
- The container of all non conceptual things and the biggest pre-nothing thing.
Antisixteenth everything layer
[
]
It's
nothing
.
Antififteenth Everything Layer
[
]
This is a
true axiom
. The most foundamental thing in post-nothing world.
Antifourteenth Everything Layer
[
]
-
, the smallest thing in this wiki to date,
but smaller
WIPs are
being created
as of now
.
Antithirteenth Everything Layer
[
]
Axions
, being the basic axioms of semi-abstract objects, and usually accepted as this layer.
Antitwelvth  Everything Layer
[
]
Null
is an axiom of the absence of anything.
Antieleventh Everything Layer (
Subexistions
)
[
]
Subexistions, are the building blocks of existence ranks, and also are the particles before
archrealities
come. It is a significant mark for this recently-declared Everything Layer, although this title could also belong to
The First Particles
.
Antitenth Everything Layer (
Blueprint Particle
)
[
]
Blueprint particles, a low-level form of information, are usually the -10
th
everything layer.
Anti 9.5th everything layer (
Negastring
)
[
]
The Negastring is the most fundamental block of negative verses.
Antininth everything layer
[
]
The
protoverse
is an important particle. Without them, we wouldn't have verses in our Omniverse.
Antieighth  Everything Layer
[
]
Strings
are the most basic building block of our Omniverse.
Antiseventh Everything Layer
[
]
The
molecule
is the main building block in our Universe.
Anti 6.5th Everything Layer
[
]
Everything humans can see, from the size of 1mm to the Earth.
Antisixth Everything Layer
[
]
The
Universe
is the most basic world. I hope there is no need to explain why it's included here in the list.
Antififth Everything Layer  (
Omniverse
)
[
]
The Omniverse, being an infinitely sized container of existence, is usually accepted as the -5nd everything layer.
Antifourth Everything Layer (
The Box
)
[
]
The Box, a self-containing container of non-existence and existence, is usually accepted as the -4st Everything Layer.
Antithird Everything Layer (
The Absolute Existence
)
[
]
It is here because for many creatures it is REALLY everything. The name speaks for itself.
Antisecond Everything Layer  (
The Last Void
)
[
]
In fact, this place is the repository of all ranks of existence. But this is inaccurate. in any case, it deserves to be here.
Antifirst Everything Layer (
Time and Reality
)
[
]
In fact, it contains time and reality, and it is also almost impossible to cross. Ironically, it used to be the biggest thing, but now it's the antifirst layer.
Nulth Everything Layer (
The Drum
)
[
]
The end of The Official Hierarchy deserves to be the Nulth Everything Layer.
0.5th Everything Layer (
The True Waterfall
)
[
]
This waterfall is literally a fiction and ends the Extended Hierarchy. It would be perfect for the last verse, but it's not even the first layer.
First Everything Layer (
Alphasm's Imagination
)
[
]
The first Everything Layer is widely accepted to be
Alphasm
's imagination. Every single verse located in Alphasm's imagination, along with an infinite amount of other things.
The Ruler of the 1st Everything Layer is simply
Alphasm
.
1.5th everything layer
[
]
Its
Fricksville
. Thats all.
Second Everything Layer (
Omnifrick
)
[
]
The second Everything Layer is a little unclear, as some say it is
Downtown Fricksville
while others say it is
The Gatus
. However, most creatures agree that the
Omnifrick
is the second Everything Layer.
The ruler of the 2nd Everything Layer used to be
BEAN MAN BUT AWSOME
, but now it's always
Melinda Ice
. Any entity that is even the tiniest bit stronger than her will be promoted into a Third Everything Layer entity. Conversely, if
Melinda Ice
becomes stronger than that entity, that entity will be demoted into a Second Everything Layer entity.
Third Everything Layer
[
]
The strongest entity in the 3rd Everything Layer is currently Eventual Chungus, and the 3rd Everything Layer itself is the
Cosmicialverse
along with many other verses. The reason why Joes are not counted is because Joes often kill eachother or dissipate.
Fourth Everything Layer
[
]
The fourth everything layer is agreed to be the end of
Plasmath
's chain* (currently the
Infinite Chain
) along many other verses. Due to the nature of chains going on long and usually taking long to complete, the fourth everything layer does not have a 100% concrete definition yet.
Due to the dynamic nature of Plasmath's chain as mentioned above, the "main verse" of this everything layer is changing, so there is no defined ruler yet.
*Contains the
Möbiverse Hyperchain
and its extension.
Fifth Everything Layer
[
]
The fifth Everything Layer is strongly agreed by many creatures to be a non-physical "collection" of all
Realms
which are numbered with one finite natural number.
As of now, no entity that we know of has attempted to rule such a massive collection of Realms, although that might change in the future.
Sixth Everything Layer
[
]
Many entities agree that the collection of realities known as the
Novachain
is the Sixth Everything layer.
This infinitely massive collection of infinite realities that dwarf everything before them was ruled by none other than the
Crab King
, until the destruction of his verse and the crab king himself.  (crab control everything xd)
Seventh Everything Layer
[
]
This layer is agreed to be the
Omnionion
, the large verse that affects the laws of containment.
Eighth Everything Layer
[
]
Currently is the collection of all
Hyperdimensions
, which are used to measure dimensions.
Ninth Everything Layer
[
]
Currently is
the Structure Of Everything
.
Tenth Everything Layer
[
]
Our
Unique Location
and its containments.
Eleventh Everything Layer
[
]
It is currently the
Pit
, the largest thing that is smaller than the Ice Cream hierarchy.
Twelfth Everything Layer
[
]
This layer is mysterious
, although it contains the
Ice Cream
and the
Cherry
. Ruled by
absolute gods
.
Thirteenth Everything Layer
[
]
Currently the
Nightmare Universe
(fits with the number 13). Ruled by extremely powerful, but unknown entities.
Fourteenth Everything Layer
[
]
This is the
last verse.
It has no property to be contained, so it deserves to be here. Moreover, everything that exists outside of it begins to contain it.
Fifteenth Everything Layer
[
]
This is an
anti-void
is all the unfilled space that exists. That is, it is a computer memory disk, but it is a world with a conceptual rank of 2.
Sixteenth Everything Layer
[
]
This consists of the
fake godity spaces
, illusions that trick civilizations into thinking the finally reached the end.
Seventeenth Everything Layer
[
]
This is
Blank
. a place where beyond godity can't make contradictions. This place has power breaks ALL concepts.
Eighteenth Everything Layer
[
]
This is the
Final Fractal
.
