”
HE is an immortal cosmic entity, and HIS real identity is unknown, but the only clear thing of HIm is that HE is a good dancer. HE is possibly a fictional
「God」
, due to him saying that HE played this game TWICE. how is that possible or not, i donno.  HE was born at least 4 times - In the Ottoman Empire, in Spain, in Lithuania, and in Austria. During HIS first lifetime HE was Muslim. He as died at least 24 times.
after dying, he will resurrect like nothing happen at all.
it seems like HE was very strong at the dawn of time, like defeating gods, literally taking continents from their foundations, and etc, but in the 19 to early 20th century, HE became somewhat weaker as he ignored the American civil war and losing many wars in WWI. Then during WWII he regain some of his strength, and became over powered again in the Cold war.
HE became weak again during the last Known events of
HIS Universe
, as he did not know what to do when his bike fell to a river, but he did became the world's greatest engineer.
