Dish wipes
[
]
There are a lot of dish wipes in this verse, and they are of all brands. There are two different types, the wet ones and the dry ones.
The wet ones are used to clean things and remove the dirt off of everything, with the help of Clorox Bleach to make sure there is absolutely no dirt left on an object. This is why this verse is often labelled as Clorox Cleaning, because it is cleaning and uses Clorox Bleach.
The dry ones are used to make things not wet anymore, since you need to make them wet to clean them, but nobody likes wet things so the dry ones help them become dry.
