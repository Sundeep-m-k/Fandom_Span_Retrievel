Versexenos
are negative-sized objects that populate the simulated
Versemetas
. The Versexenos resembles toxic
Glitchonicite
rivers, but they have a trash can in the center which can contain all lost data from their local Versemeta. In this way, they resemble negative versions of the
Xenoversse
.
Versehypers
can also be found randomly floating in the river.  They contain exactly 4
hecks
in the middle. There are primitive simulated entities inside some Versexenos, called
Scalenes
.
Location
[
]
Since they are rivers, the Versexenos are most common near the Start Screen river valley of a Versemeta. One of them is also in the exit bar, which contains exactly 2
Versehypers
(one leading to any location needed in their local
Verseuni
, and one back to their local
Versemega
).
