The Evolutionary imaginative limit(eil) is the strongest point where the naiveness of humans will be, which allows for avoiding utmost important disciplines and logical constructs. Which all turns out to be a fallacy, because all of the naiveness of humans (which allows for things beyond the omniverse, which shouldn't be possible) replies on fictional concepts.
The metaphysical truth
[

Nothing you experience or understand, whether it be philosophy, metaphysics, logic, science, fact, functionality, etc, are the truth(Which is a very paradoxical statement). The reality is, nothing close to what you understand, and the truth is, we don't know what the real reality is like, but the one you experience is different from the other person in an absolute way(everything you can conceive is different including conceiving, beatability, different, surpassing, experience, life, senses, etc) which means that this page appears differently for you, than it does for the writer. Making everything that happens through your "bubble" a fallacy in mine, so "surpassing" in your bubble, is different than mine"; And a scary thing is, that there is no way to disprove this, making it self-evidently true.
