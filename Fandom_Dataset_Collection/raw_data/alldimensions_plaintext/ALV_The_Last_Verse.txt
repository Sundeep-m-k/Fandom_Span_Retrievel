(Not to be confused with the
Last Verse
of the
2nd class
).
ALV The Last Verse
(ALVTLV) is the largest verse in
Absolutely Large Verses
. ALV The Last Verse is very colorful, and have every possible colors we could ever perceive of and not
[

]
(not a box of colors). Not just that, ALV-TLVs are alike the
last verses
, because if an
ALV Ultra-Box
is bigger, it ALV-TLV either gets bigger or make that box smaller. They also are in an infinite number of existence rank, and have colored dimensions where it appears as a color of the item's background.

Contains
ALV Ultra-Box
There are four types of ALVTLVs - positive, negative, neutral and null. They are different as the properties could go either of them. Positive (+) ones are those whose existence rank, temperature, etc. are positive. They are the ones we commonly find. Negative (-) verses aren't negative, as the colors would only appear opposites (red would be cyan, green would magenta, blue would be yellow and so on). They are in negative dimensions, so if you're in that verse, you'll see things that appear not where they are, more like as if they're mirrored. Neutral is both while null is none of them (glitchy due to being neither + nor -).
Colored dimensions
[
]
They are dimensions that every object inside has. An object's dimension is not the same anything else. They are the colors that appear outside that object (may produce some light). They're not visible normally, so they're like as if they keep their secret.
