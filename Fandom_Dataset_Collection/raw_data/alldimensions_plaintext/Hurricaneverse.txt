Hurricanes
[
]
It’s not called the Hurricaneverse for nothing! Every decade or two, raging,
devastating
cosmic storms sweep the Verse and cause huge damage to galaxies, which take years to clean up. No-one exactly knows why or how this happens, but some think it is because of mess-ups in the
Radioverse
. Another - (albeit very crazy) but still possible theory is that this is
div
ine
interven
tion
.
What Populates the Hurricaneverse?
[
]
Well, human-like creatures called Arranoids. They look very similar to humans, but there eyes look more like those of moths, and they have one more finger. There is also a rogue robot that’s basically just been going around annoying people with
[intense metal screeching noise].
Someone please stop this. (?)
Relationships with other Verses
[
]
- The Radioverse is a pocket-dimension invented by Arranoids that they use for radio purposes
- The Spinnychairverse is located in the center of the Hurricaneverse, but no-one can get inside
- Very recently, Arranoids received a transmission from a Verse north of their location. They sent a signal back, but have not gotten another reply.
Notable Technology
[
]
Storm-Away
[
]
This device appears as a simple box with a button on it. However, it is more. When pressing the button, a shield will appear in a small radius around the box, and this can drive away the cosmic hurricanes that ravage this Verse every now and then. Lately it has been discovered it can also drive away baby rats that are painted blue. (???)
Teleporter
[
]
This Verse’s iteration of this device comes in the form of an attachable chest piece that uses an unnamed material harvested from nebulae as fuel to teleport the wearer to a set location.
THIS SECTION IS THE ONE I REALLY NEED TO ADD MORE TO, I WILL DO SO WHEN I GET MORE IDEAS.
Types of Planets & Stars
[
]
Terrestrial Planet
[
]
Just your average planet, made of dirt and rocks. Usually some water too. The most easily terraformable type of planet.
Gas Planet
[
]
Not called a Gas Giant for some reason. Made of hot gas. What did you expect?
Oven Planet
Oven Planets are made of extremely, extremely hot solids and liquids that can be up to 55,555,555,555,555,544 degrees Celsius.
Star
[
]
Just a Star. Made of hot gas that the star constantly fuses in order to burn.
Wwww Star
[
]
Very unique. One in every 4627 stars are a wwww Star. Wwww stars appear as ultraviolet cubes that sometimes shift into diamonds. They constantly warp time and space around them and disable all electricity that is a certain radius around them. However, if you somehow get there, putting milk into the core of a wwww star will explode It.
