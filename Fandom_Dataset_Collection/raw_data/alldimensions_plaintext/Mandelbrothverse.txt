Mandelbrothverse
Scale

The lowest iteration is as large as
Cantor's Absolute Infinity
times larger than
Mandelbrothsoups
on average. Otherwise read the article, applied CAI levels up.

The
Mandelbrothverses
are cosmic structures with surprisingly high stability for their size and types of
verses
within them. They're home to almost all verses with any sort of
fractal
theme below their size, including themselves and
Mandelbrothsoups
. Another notable thing they contain are extremely large pools of a broth-like
substance
scattered around their space.
Self Containment
[
]
The Mandelbrothverses, although not fractal structures, are
self-containing
ones to match their name and nature of the Mandel- prefix. All layers of containment within them hold broth bubbles and fractally based structures, and of course many of the previous layer. They actually only grow a finite amount of the previous iteration's diameter. This
number
ranges anywhere from 100 - 200000x the size, but ALWAYS averages out at 4571x/iteration over all of the containers.
Broth
[
]
As its namesake, the Mandelbrothverses hold large amounts of broth-like substance in their
voids
, making up about 10% of the mass of the object in all iterations on average. It's been heavily studied and tested in multiple environments, and it seems to be a tasteless, light brown
liquid
with no negative or positive features. No use as fuel,
food
, or any other thing a liquid can serve as. It doesn't even have a texture we associate with matter, but is still mallable and existent.
