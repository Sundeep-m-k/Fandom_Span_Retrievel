The "Omniverse-Sized" Universe (aka Omniversal Universe, the infinite Universe, the endless universe, whole of reality, etc.) is an
Universe
that its size is equal to one of an
omniverse
(i.e it's size is countable infinitely large) it currently has no official name.
This
Verse
is one of the largest universes ever recorded. It can contain so many
verses
since it is infinitely large but cannot contain higher levelled verses, such as
Multiverses
and instead gets contained by a
Box
. Since it is infinite in size, it has an EUSI of φ(1), meaning that they contain everything that exists and nonexists. Other properties are also infinite, due to its size. This Universe is also self-contained for the same reason. That's why it's so much different from ordinary Universes, despite having content like them but more.
It is also nearly indestructible (even thougher than a
Box
itself, somehow) and sentient.

Formation
Formation
[
]
The "Omniverse-sized" Universe was created by
THE TRUE CREATOR
and was the first verse created in its local
Paper
, being formed 69 billion years ago in the void between omniverses after
Slightly Younger Tiny Tippy Tinkletrousers
was accidentally sent back 69 billion years ago with his thermonuclear bomb, and then the big bang started, forming the young universe, which initially was as big as 2 universes.

(note: this is NOT the captain underpants universe, even tough it has Tippy, it is not the same universe, this universe has lots of events from different universes and stuff, also the universe is the universe that
