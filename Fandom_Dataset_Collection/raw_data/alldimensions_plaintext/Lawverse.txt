The
Lawverse
, otherwise known as the Ruleverse, is a law-centric verse containing
the Outside
, with a vast variety of ordered systems that lay out many
archversal
concepts and objects (i.e. life).
Entropy
[
]
Despite the Lawverse being the reason life exists (indirectly), the Lawverse is too entropic to support ecosystems in itself, therefore any organisms that come across the Lawverse usually disintegrate into a "chaotic Verse spaghetti".
Inframassive Black Holes
[
]
Additionally, the presence of entropy also causes the presence of Inframassive black holes. Inframassive black holes are black holes on an
Omniverse
-destroying scale of magnitude, which can and have caused mass destruction in multiple
Sortaverse
collisions. These black holes have rarely destroyed a Lawverse or the
Outside
, but the Inframassive black holes still demonstrate massive destruction power.
Age
[
]
The Lawverse's order systems have a few implications. One of these, arising from the Lawverse's role in forming complex spacetime objects, is age. Specifally, the age is
Ï‰
5
{\displaystyle \omega^5}
OYC
, with the Lawverse's formation preceding many objects including the
Omniverse
itself.
