Puffgas
(
Bood-Zii-Vav
in
Puffish
) is the source of all mortal life within the
Primordialverse
, and was created 1 day before the other of
THE 8 DIVINE GODS
, excluding
BOOD-VOOD-VAV
, its opposite.
Its first 3 creations, Puffballs, Pufftals, and Puffians, represent its 3 qualities:
Puffballs - Its Innocence
Pufftals - Its Form
Puffians - Its Intelligence
It has since then, much improved its life creation skills, but is still very fond of those first 3. Any civilisation it has created which reaches a 'godlike' status, will be brought up into Puffgas's realm (AKA the
Primordialverse
's heaven),which is known as
Primordia
along with the souls of any other dead beings of said civilisation.
