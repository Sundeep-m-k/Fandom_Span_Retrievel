The Verse Trap (Yeb Prob Kryf'pay Prow in
The Pencil Language
) is a massive, hidden structure embedded within the
Omniverse
. If a verse comes into the vicinity of The Verse Trap, all sorts of bad things can happen to the verse, such as the verse being shredded, frozen and heated to extremes, or being locked into place and unable to move, forming an
Anchorverse
.
The Verse Trap usually traps 40 verses per
OYC
day, however there have been OYC days where it has trapped 0 verses and some where it has trapped 12,147 (the most ever recorded).
The Verse Trap is feared by many civilizations, as it has been proven to obliterate its victim verses in horrible ways.
Contrary to popular belief, the Verse Trap
does not cycle through things in a periodic or deterministic way to inflict to its target verse.
The Verse Trap has over 10

different ways of destroying a verse, as noted by a

The Verse Trap appears to move to a random location in the Omniverse every

Earth years. This, along with how it cannot be detected by even today's most advanced technology, has made The Verse Trap nigh impossible to find. Still, civilizations have tasked creatures and even hosted events with huge rewards to see who can find The Verse Trap. Some civilizations have hosted these events simply to use The Verse Trap as a weapon.
The Verse Trap's origins are mostly unknown, although many theories suggest that it was created because of a
Cosmic Zaaaaaaaap
.
One of The Verse Trap's most well-known victims is the
Trappedverse
, the only verse in history to have been trapped 5 times in about 3 minutes.
