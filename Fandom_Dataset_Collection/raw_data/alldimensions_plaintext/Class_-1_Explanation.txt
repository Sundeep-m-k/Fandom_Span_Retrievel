Primordium Particles
[
]
There are four types of Primordium Particles:
Primordium Alpha
,
Primordium Omega
,
Primordium Sigma
, and
Primordium Delta
.
Primordium Alpha is a bright particle that has positive effects on people, but when mixed with Primordium Omega and Primordium Delta it becomes extremely dangerous.
Primordium Omega is like the opposite of Primordium Alpha, being dark and chaotic, and is found in almost all voids. Things surrounded by Primordium Omega may be absorbed by it.
Primordium Sigma is a particle where any force applied to it is also applied to the origin of the force (e.g. punching it will punch you).
Primordium Delta is the rarest Primordium Particle, and in its purest form it glows many colors. If matter touches Primordium Delta, it will be converted to Primordium Delta.
Blueprint Particles
[
]
Blueprint Particles
are some of the first particles, constructing things like "existence states, energy, matter, light, sound, mind, and more." All Primordium Particles are made from Blueprint Particles, same with everything in Class 0. Blueprint Particles do contain lower
Archrealities
than itself. Blueprint Particles are the first particles to be so small they do not have a size, represented as ∅ (pronounced 'null').
Attempting to split a Blueprint Particle will result in it repairing itself, and are stable on their own. Their are multiple types of Blueprint Particles with some differences, but they are all mostly the same. Blueprint Particles evolved from
·s
to become a more complex particle.
⬤
[
]
⬤
is a particle that formed when ·s collided. It only has one property, and is used as the building block for the properties of other particles and verses. A closely related particle is ○, which is a sort of 'wrapper' around ·s that protect the normal world from paradoxes. Eventually Blueprint Particles could form because of ⬤s forming, although because of this they will become more and more rare over time.
·
[
]
·
is a particle that has zero properties, and is one of the most basic things to ever be created. It is nothing more than a point which its only capability is to be able to exist or not, but it never exists with any energy. The paradoxical nature of · is negated by the ○s seen above. There are also abstract properties that is cancelled out by a lower particle which we will talk about later. This adds up to 0 properties.
Protoparticle
[
]
Protoparticles
are particles that make up Protorealities (realities far above and below ours) and Blueprint Particles. They can be formed from ·s colliding. This particle is still theoretical.
Xeyon
[
]
The
Xeyon
is a particle that composes forces and what properties are themselves. In other words, the Xeyons define properties.
The Anti-Concept
[
]
The Anti-Concept
is a particle with a negative number of properties. These can be found in ·s and allow them to have 0 properties, as well as ⬤ to have one property. It is the largest particle with a negative number of properties.
Omnipocket (minimum size)
[
]
Omnipockets
are pockets found in many spaces and can connect different data/laws/properties (e.g size and dimensionality) to different number systems (e.g. positive, negative, and ·-scale). However, only laws can be passed through easily, but using special black holes objects can be passed through.
Zyoron
[
]
Zyoron
is a Xiversal-kind particle which maps metabits into non-numeral metadata for Omnipockets.
