A wormhole is a cosmic hole that can bend space time and bring two parts of it together. Species commonly use the wormhole to travel to different locations in space time, but it can be extremely risky to use too much of them as it might corrupt the universe they are being used in. It’s size and shape depends on its universes qualities. It can only be used on universes, but certain technology is being made to expand that.
Wormholes can vary from a tiny one-kilometer to a large 100,000 light years, but they usually all look the same when they are used.
History of Wormholes
[
]
Back when the
Omniverse
was first created, lots of archverses started to appear inside them. Wormholes first started to appear in hyperverses, then eventually everywhere in the omniverse. Life in the omniverse started harvesting them for teleportation, war, and more, and they soon realized that they were destroying dimensions around them.
Several wars started to break out between dimensions and
Interdimensional Void
s. This started a huge war that thousands of universes participated in, called the Great Wormhole War. It ended in wormholes being prohibited to most entities, and after that, only entities far up in the hierarchy were allowed to use wormholes. After that, wormholes started to be rediscovered by the common people, so very powerful entities prohibited their use for a while.
But, one powerful entity went rogue and started destroying tons of universes with wormholes. This sparked another wormhole war, but thankfully, it didn’t last very long this time.
Omniversal Wormholes

Wormholes are currently being developed that are meant to carry entities to any
Archverse
possible. For example: a hyperverse to a metaverse, or a multiverse to a universe. Not many tests have been done with them, since they are extremely early in development.
