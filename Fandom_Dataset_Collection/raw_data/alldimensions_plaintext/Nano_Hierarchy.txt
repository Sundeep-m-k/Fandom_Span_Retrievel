Nano Hierarchy Size Quantifiers
[
]
Verses, to have their "sizes" understood, must also be understood by one who understands these size quantifiers.
Lower Quantifiable Level
[
]
This is the level where the
Conceptual Gate
is. It is at the lowest level at which size is quantifiable, or enumerable.
High Unquantifiable Level
[
]
This is where the larger particles in the nano hierarchy are. They are not quantifiable, but are still larger than other things.
Lower Unquantifiable Level
[
]
This is where the smallest particles in the nano hierarchy are. They are starting to approach a level at which not even words can quantify their size.
That is all that is needed to be understood.
Particle 1: Altoid
[
]
Altoids are small particles that store storage itself. They are around 1 / N

times smaller than
