Blanks
, also known as inverse
·s
, are verses that have a net of zero properties. Likewise, all positive properties cancel out with
negative ones
. Otherwise, everything contained by it would collapse into infinite chaos.
⬤
particles are never found here, hence containment is a physical property.
Blanks have no positive properties at all, not even numbers, sizes, dimensionalities, and
existence ranks
. This marks the benchmark of verses, and also marking the end of a hierarchy of increasing-size.
So here it is, the "end" of an end.
We always tried to make and discover bigger things, because we needed more.
But nobody ever thought of something so unfathomably strange, that it transcends this continued hierarchy of size, of non-spatial size, of metaphysical size. Of course, there will always be more things, much higher up in the hierarchy but they will never actually be "bigger", for anything past this point transcends the meager concept of size itself.
This is the end... And a new beginning.
