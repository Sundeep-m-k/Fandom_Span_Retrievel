Tiniests
are particles so small that even the most advanced technology cant study them well. Information is so scarce, that the Infobox on the right is actually the best information obtained, despite it being incomplete. Only one Image of them has been recorded, but the information is top secret as it is archived in an extremely well-protected place (conveniently it is put in the infobox, though). An unreasonable amount of Tiniests exist in a single
Smallestest
. They reportedly look like a Blurry Grayish-White Dot, with the image taken from them confirming this.

Overall
The Tiniests themselves
[
]
Tiniests are not only unbelievably tiny (duh), but also unbelievably unstable (like a ton of previous particles, what a surprise), in fact they're so unstable, that even if they graze eachother for the smallest amount of time (of which is even shorter than Negative% of a
Voidsecond
) they'll explode into an explosion as large as an
Omniplasm
, but the reason why they go unnoticed is because despite the explosion radius being insanely large, they're mostly just a shockwave and the most damage they can do is bascially nothing. Basically, great range but low strenght. Not even their local Smallestest is really affected by them, unless they stack which can slighty distort them.
Entities
[
]
Believe it or not, entities actually exist inside of a Tiniest. Here are some of them.
Tinymen
[
]
The only actual entities that exists in a Tiniest. They look like miniature versions of their local particle. They don't do anything besides existing, but they can somehow think.
Tinyguys
[
]
These are little structures orbiting the Tinymen, with roughly 8 of them orbiting around one. They protect their Tinyman and will do anything to defend them, even sacrificing themselves in order to do so. They can regenerate too.
Tinythings
[
]
This is basically the matter that makes up a Tiniest, since these are not made up of actual matter. They're classified as entities because they can communicate with the Tinyguys.
Tiniest Web
[
]
The Tiniest Web is a material that attempts to make its local Tiniest Stable, but it almost always fails because it is not strong enough. They are made up of dense amounts of Tinythings, and are more common in the core of their local particle, which is why that section is darker than the rest of the Tiniest.
Tiniest Core
[
]
The Tiniest Core are the cores inside all Tiniests that is the reason why they exists. When dense amounts of them appear, they make a Proto-Tiniest. This proto-Tiniest turns into a normal Tiniest by expanding it. The larger a Tiniest Core is, the more stable their particle is.
Overall
[
]
Tiniests are Ungodly small things that exists. Most of the known information about them was leaked by a thief that gathered information about them when they robbed the same place the only Image of Tiniest was ever recorded. The other information was the ones available to the public before the heist.
