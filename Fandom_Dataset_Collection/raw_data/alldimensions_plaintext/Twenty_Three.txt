About
[

Twenty-Three
or
23
(
Twenty Three
in the
Pencil Language
,
X
X
I
I
I
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {X}}XIII}
in Roman numerals) is the first Post-
11sDverse
type of
verse
, the 3
rd
object
in the
Twenty-One Chain
and the 23
rd
one in the
Number chain
. A Twenty Three grows Super-True Form 23 (or STF 23) light years every 23
OYC
. Since its properties are so extreme, the numbers used for this verse's properties is just the 23, in the form of Super-True Form.
What is a "Super-True Form" of a number?
[
]
You might be asking, what is the Super-True Form / STF of numbers? It is just like the Absolute Form but even greater than that. It makes any
number
much greater than the largest number in their Absolute Forms, so the STF numbers would be post-conceptual. Also, a leap from a number to the next is very large, so for example a STF 2 isn't only just twice as much as a STF 1. By using this form to the numbers, this type of verse has as much explanations as possible in order to be so tremendous.
In this case, the number 23 would roughly be 23√ó10
‚©∏^23
light years, though some Twenty Three variants have been recorded to be 23 times bigger than that (~529√ó10
‚©∏^23
light years), which also makes them grow 23 times quicker.
Structure
[
]
A normal Twenty Three has an extremely luminous structure with exactly 23
Twenty Twos
inside it.
The larger variants contain several pocket dimensions, and in each they also have 23 Twenty Twos in them. They're also slighty darker, since their luminosity isn't upscaled along with their size.
In general, the older and/or bigger a Twenty Three is, the less luminosity they have.
