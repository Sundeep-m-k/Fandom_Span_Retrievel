The
verse
is a verse with many odd properties within it, and compared to humans, is mostly incomprehensible. There are a few very powerful lifeforms which reside there, which include ÿÿÿÿÿÿ, eK , and ÎN¦�.ö 
. Most data relating to the verse that has been researched ends up highly redacted and corrupted for unknown reasons, making it even harder to research. Areas closer to the center of the verse tend to be unbelievably chaotic.
eK
[
]
eK, commonly called "ek", is the entity with the most information known about it. It has 3 thin appendages resembling legs, although the shape of its head is unknown. The being usually resides within the calmer and less chaotic parts of the verse. It will wander around the edges of the verse, not doing much else. For unknown reasons, It will occasionally meet up with the 2 other beings.
ÎN¦�.ö
[
]
ÎN¦�.ö, which can be called "ino" for short, is the oddest of all of the beings, existing in the central, more intense parts. It has 3 wider and shorter legs, and appears to have an odd rectangle-shaped head. It will often journey near the centre of the verse and come back out, meeting up with the other entities occasionally.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿ
[
]
ÿÿÿÿÿÿ, or "yy" for short, is a creature with no information; nobody has any images of what it looks like. All images of it have been replaced with white blank images. Similarly, all documentation on it has been completely erased; we only know that this being simply exists. Because the other beings also have 3 legs, it is likely that it does as well, although it cannot be proven.
