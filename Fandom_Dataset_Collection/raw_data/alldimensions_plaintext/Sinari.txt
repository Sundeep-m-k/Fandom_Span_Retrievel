Start of technological advances - 4000 years ago
Sinari is a civilisation which originated in UNI-3. They are very intelligent and rule over 2100 galaxies, and are members of the
Local Universal Alliance
. They are similar to Earth centipedes, but they are much larger. They originate from the planet Custia.

Picture of Planet Custia
Overview
[
]
Custia is a modest, habitable planet in the Lorosari Galaxy. It is located 0.08 AU from its star, Tunustit. This may seem very close but Tunustit is a very dim star (having only 0.04 stellar luminosities). It has a radius of 4566 kilometres and a mass of 0.39 Earth masses.
Atmosphere
[
]
Map of Custia
Custia's atmosphere is rich in oxygen and nitrogen, with trace amounts of carbon dioxide and argon. This makes it have ideal conditions for megafauna.
Surface
[
]
Around half of Custia's surface is covered in water. These oceans are very shallow however, leading to a very noisy surface, with lots of tiny islands and lakes.
Biosphere
[
]
Custia has various forms of life. Most plantlife on the planet is aquatic, leading to the planet's land appearing beige. The majority of lifeforms are also aquatic, except for insects like centipedes (which the Sinari descend from).
Moons
[
]
Custia has two moons: Xame (decently sized, the size of Pluto) and Oris (An asteroid).
Biology
[
]
The biology of the Sinari is not particularly interesting. It's like the biology for a centipede, but adapted to be bigger.
History
[
]
First Era (20 million years ago)
[
]
The First Era was the era when the Custian insects left the ocean for land. Oxygen was plentiful and the gravity was little, so they grew to quite a large size. Herbivores mostly got their food from the water, and carnivores stayed on land all the time to catch prey.
Primitive Era (1 million years ago)
[
]
In this era, the Sinari finally started walking upright (kind of) and started creating tools and fire. They also divided themselves into tribes.
First Cities (40,000 years ago)
[
]
This is when the Sinari discovered agriculture, and the first Sinarian cities were made. They were made with rudimentary clay and mud bricks. Since the Sinari are cold-blooded and their bodies aren't hot enough to melt gallium like humans, the first metalworking was done with it. Discovery of
cheese
.
Bronze & Iron Era (30,000 years ago)
[
]
Ways to work with bronze and iron were made. This is also when writing was first created.
First Discoveries (25,000 years ago)
[
]
The first discoveries in astronomy, math, science and agriculture were made. Cities expanded heavily.
25,901 years ago (-608 ST): Uira Meses establishes the Peranis Empire. At its peak, it spanned  4,290,000 km
2
.
25,293 years ago (0 ST): the Peranis Empire falls after a catastrophic flood hits the capital, drowning the Peranis leader Numu Loran. This causes an inheritance problem that ultimately causes the fracture of the country. Start of Sinari Time (ST).
Second Discoveries (23,000 years ago)
[
]
The rest of the planet was discovered, and even more discoveries were made.
Industrialisation Era (22,800 years ago)
[
]
Full colonisation of the planet and first machinery.
Second Industrialisation Era (22,700 years ago)
[
]
Discovery of electricity. More automation than ever!
Third Industrialization Era (22,600 years ago)
[
]
Start of digitalization. First computers, they are very pretty big if i do say so myself (10 meters)
2798 ST: First computer.
Space Age (22,500 years ago)
[
]
Start of space colonization. Sinarians land on Zame and Oris, where they set up platinum, iron, nickel and
dysprosium
mining sites.
Interstellar Era (22,000 years ago)
[
]
After centuries of exploration of Custia's and Lesaros's moons and revolutionary technological advancements, the Sinari finally develop reliable FTL technology and start exploration of other star systems. The Sinari civilization gets recognised by the
Local Universal Alliance
and becomes a member.
3942 ST: Discovery of bacterial organisms in a moon called Upsos in a nearby star system (9 light-years away from the Sinari's system). This was the first other life discovered by the Sinari.
Intergalactic Era (20,000 years ago)
[
]
Faster FTL, capable of travelling intergalactic distances.
5241 ST: An FTL machine is glitched and leads 53 sinari to discover the
GregTech Dimension
.
5250 - 5300: Start of the utilization of GregTech machines.
