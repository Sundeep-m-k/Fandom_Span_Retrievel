The
up quark
or
u quark
(symbol: u) is the lightest of all
quarks
, a type of
elementary particle
, and a significant constituent of
matter
. It, along with the
down quark
, forms the
neutrons
(one up quark, two down quarks) and
protons
(two up quarks, one down quark) of
atomic nuclei
. It is part of the first generation of matter, has an electric charge of +2/3 e and a
bare mass
of 2.2±0.45 MeV/c
2.
Like all
quarks
, the up quark is an
elementary
fermion
with spin 1/2, and experiences all four fundamental interactions:
gravitation
,
electromagnetism
, weak interactions, and strong interactions. The
antiparticle
of the up quark is the
up antiquark
(sometimes called antiup quark or simply antiup), which differs from it only in that some of its properties, such as charge have equal magnitude but opposite sign.
The Up Quark’s radius is
0.43 x 10
-16
cm.
It contains a
String
.
Anti-Up Quark
[
]
The Anti-Up Quark, Up Antiquark or just Antiup is the exact same thing as an Up Quark, except the charge is negative, so the Anti-Up Quark just has a charge of -

e instead of +
2
/
3
e. When an Anti-Up quark meets an up quark, they annihilate and form a virtual photon, a particle that is incredibly short lived. Shortly after, it turns into a number of
electrons
and
positrons
.
An Up Quark decays into a
Down Quark
and a
W
+
Boson
, which is short lived, and decays into a
positron
and an
electron neutrino
. Of course, the mass of the byproducts is greater than the original, so this decay only occurs when energy is supplied from an outside source eg. two
protons
colliding, forming a
proton
,
neutron
, a
positron
and an
electron neutrino
.
