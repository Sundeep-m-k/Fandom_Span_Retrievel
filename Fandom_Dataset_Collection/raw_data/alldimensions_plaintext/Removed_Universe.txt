The Removed Universe is an alternative universe outside of our own, containing everything that has ever been removed, dismantled, destroyed, or just deleted, along with every version of them. Upon something changing in a major way, the original version of it gets added to the Removed Universe. It is impossible to enter or exit the Removed Universe due to the anomalous magnetic field surrounding it, that in the central diameter is actually faster than light speed (exactly 12% faster).
How it differentiates what to push in and out
[
]
it differentiates them by having some form of memory system with it, that has all atoms within it, stored... somewhere. We have no idea where, but it knows what atoms to let in and out.
Trivia
[
]
The diameter of the field is ~4 times larger than the RU itself
This does contain every split atom, but those atoms don't do anything in the RU.
Yes, long dead memes will be in this universe as well. Seeing how they fell out of memory of everyone, they will not be visible without a microscope.
There will not be billions of copies for one object as it is being dismantled or destroyed. It will only get a new version of an object once a new piece is broken off.
Yes the thanos snap'd people will be here.
