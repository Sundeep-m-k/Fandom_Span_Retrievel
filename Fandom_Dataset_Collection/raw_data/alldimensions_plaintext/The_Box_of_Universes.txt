About
[
]
The
Box of Universes
(also known as the
Universal Box
) is, well, a variation of a
Box
full of
Universes
, and ONLY Universes and nothing else. In fact, it's filled to the brim with them. It doesn't even
contain itself
like a normal Box, replacing that function with EVEN MORE Universes.
Oh, and it also is far larger than an average Box, to the point it is beyond a mere
class 1
Terminator
and instead turns into a
class 2
structure
, but to be honest almost no one cares about that.
Importance
[
]
This is an extremely special and one-of-a-kind Box and it is very delicate. It has so much life on every side of it that it's just a glass titanium alloy type case. It contains an inaccessible cardinal amount of Universes. Anything that enters in it is a violation. This box just pukes the violation out instantly, it wants to keep its ecosystem undisturbed.
Yes, you could technically make a box identical to this one, but the Box of Universes is the only Box that NATURALLY got the property, or at least the only one found for now in our
Wikiverse
somehow.
It is loved by almost all local
entities
, and damaging / destroying it is considered as a Wikiversal level crime, and even some
TOGs
intervene with hostily if such a tragic scenario takes place. Don't worry: beings as powerful as them can obviously get the Box of Universes fixed in case anyone affects it negatively.
Origins
[
]
Most entities dont even care about its backstory, since it just
naturally appeared like any other Box
but had the sheer luck to only have Universes on it. It's just... there, for some reason.
