The
Great Void
aka the
Transcendent Void
is an enormous type of void that contains lots of
Transcendent Boxes
. We barely know some small things about it:
- Their cores are average Transcendent Boxes.
- The temperature of these places is about Ω°C outside the local Transcendent Box areas.
- Weirdly they're not black but a very dark green instead. You may ask why in the image the green doesnt looks THAT dark, and it's because the photo was taken in one of the shiniest parts of a Great Void.
