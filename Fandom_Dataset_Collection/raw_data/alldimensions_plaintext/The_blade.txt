The blade.
Scale
Size
Larger than
the Horse Statues
by more than A0, but also larger than itself, resulting in it being larger than the axiomatic limit due to the fact that logic is not real.
EUSI
Extremly big, at this point its basicly imposible to calculate an Eusi. Like, why people still filling this space? Totally stupid.

The edge.
The blade
is a verse where space and time as well as the many other things are all broken at the edges, but most of them are normal on the inside except for holes that kill anything that gets too close, even vsauian entities. It is impossible to exit these verses without teleporting outside for many reasons, including the fact that the edges would likely just bring you back to the middle if you are lucky. When you reach the edges of the verse, it gets larger, but the edges do not move back.
The edge
[
]
Pictured below this is an image of what you might see at the edge of a blade. The edge is impossible to survive if you can see it. Sometimes the edge changes its
Existence Rank
and this might have an effect on spacetime in other verses. It can also make itself stop existing for a while, which will result in the rank not changing for a long time, but then the edge is replaced with a placeholder that stops teleportation and other means to escape, resulting in the blade sort of being a prison for anything inside.
The inside
[
]
The inside is normal. It is just like every other verse. Nothing really special to see.
