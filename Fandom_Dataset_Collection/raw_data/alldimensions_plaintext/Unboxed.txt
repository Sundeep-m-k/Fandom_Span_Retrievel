Unboxed
is an extension of
The Warehouse
, that relaxes the restrictions on
Existence Ranks
. That is, it allows for a generalized reality state that allows for arbitrary containment and attraction relations to form between verses of different/same reality states.
Reality States
[
]
Unlike traditional Existence Ranks, Reality States are not bound by order and chaos sums (since those two aren't a stable concept at Unboxed's scale), and also don't necessarily have to form attraction pairs.
This means that Reality States can form attraction cycles and graphs of arbitrary lengths/connections, with no requirement to be transitive or communicative.
Pseudo-Boxes
[
]
A Pseudo-Box is a self-containing system of layers, where each section of the system is a specific Reality State.
Psuedo-Boxes can contain smaller cycles of Psuedo-Boxes in order to increase size, and systems can even be implemented to control the layer structure. However, this size incrementation is still bound by
φ
(
1
,
0
,
0
)
{\displaystyle \varphi (1,0,0)}
, due to the fact that each layer of cycles can be optimized to correspond to
φ
(
x
,
0
)
{\displaystyle \varphi(x,0)}
, which is bound by
φ
(
1
,
0
,
0
)
{\displaystyle \varphi (1,0,0)}
via fixed points.
Due to the higher counts of layers than our
The Box
, large Pseudo-Boxes and their layers have been exploited to clone a variety of objects and verses. This includes
The Box
itself, which is cloned due to higher stability/habitability/usefulness of The Box.
Pseudo-Warehouses
[
]
Pseudo-Warehouses are clusters of similar Pseudo-Boxes, usually unified by an increment/decrement in a property. The distances between are usually less than the average size of each Pseudo-Box in the cluster, making them even more useful for cloning if all of them are merged. However, merging requires a large amount of energy and a specific type of reality that can interact with the whole Pseudo-Warehouse, so merging is a rare event.
