Toxicium
is the 200th element in the
periodic table
, it is so unstable and acidic that almost no type of matter can withstand it.
If heated enough, it will begin glowing blue and transform into a violent gas, spreading out in all directions, turning all matter around it into Toxicium as well. Once this state of matter is achieved, Whatever universe it is present in will be 100% devoured in (
omniversal
) days, leaving only this blue, erasive gas.
The Blue Void
is made of Toxicium in its gas state, making the
Primordialverse
even more difficult to access. Only the gravitational effects of
negative black holes
can be used to counteract the "infectious" effect of Toxicium.
It is also extremely similar to
strange matter
in the way that it interacts with other materials, to a lesser extent.
How Toxicium and other stuff is made
When it touches
cuandaic acid
, it will react and dissolve to form
toxicuandaic slurry
.
