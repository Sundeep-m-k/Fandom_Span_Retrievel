Appearance
[
]
Official Version
[
]
It takes appearance as many verses from this wiki on the background such as
Hyperverse
,
Universe
or
Metaverse
, in the middle there is a gray circle with five different verses inside of it
Scrapped Version

]
The Scrapped version isn't much different to the official version, it has the same Appearance but it has a black background instead of the verses background
More Information
[
]
The ultimate verse  contains approximately 1500 verses in it, but that doesn't mean it can't be contained by something, as it is contains by
Allsphere
,
The Ultimate Reality
,
Transcendent Omni-God
,
FANDOMverse
, etc. It was also contained by the verse known as
Beyond The Ultimate Verse,
unfortunately that idea got scrapped for unknown reasons. The physical form of this verse is a transparent big gray bubble that is meant to cover all the verses. It's impossible to travel outside of it as it's almost 5.4 Googolplex light years away from us
Scale

(More explanation about the Scale) Its scale is unknown so it's marked withÂ ??? at the moment, some theories say that it may be an extremely large number others say that it isn't exactly calculated, but it's still unknown nonetheless
