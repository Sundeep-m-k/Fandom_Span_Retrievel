Info
This is an element commonly used as a substitute for rubber
It is ideal as a substitute for rubber because it is very stretchy, but strong and able to handle lots of tension.
Alkaton is only found in the remains of nuclear reactors in 267 OYC. The element was produced inside all nuclear reactors. The reason it wasn't noticed before in 1945 was that the form made was Alkaton 768, which is an extremely unstable isotope and disintigrates a yoctosecond after formation. In the year 267 OYC, more efficient nuclear reactors were developed and made Alkaton 764, which is stable.
