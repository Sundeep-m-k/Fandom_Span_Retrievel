Purple Plus
is a Class 14 verse which contains
the Garage
and is contained by
Mandelbroth
. It is a large, purple, plus-shaped verse with a viscous, thick, gelatin-like consistency.  Its viscosity increases the closer to the center one gets, which makes traveling there a nearly impossible task. The verse mostly just consists of vast stretches of purple gel, but occasionally, verses and even life can be found
Contents of the verse
[
]
Purple Plus is home to various creatures and strange anomalies. The verse tends to get even stranger as the the center is approached.
The Squids
[
]
Occasionally, purple squid-like creatures can be found swimming throughout Purple Plus, especially in the Eastern Peninsula. Not very much is known about them, as sightings are rare. They can range in size anywhere from 10 meters to 850 km in length, although they may possibly be lower or higher than this. When they are approached, they screech at a high-frequency of about 2431 Hz. They appear to eat on the humanoid creatures which can be found in the verse. It is unknown how many of them exist.

These creatures are usually passive in nature, but they occasionally become hostile for unknown reasons. During an expedition of the verse, the members of exploration unit EU Echo-89 were exploring the Eastern Peninsula when they encountered one of these creatures about 4 days into their journey. As they began to approach the squid, the creature abruptly screeched and charged towards their vehicle at an incredible speed. Audio and video feed cut out, and Echo-89 was never heard from again. Due to this incident, exploration teams now carry heavy weaponry when exploring Purple Plus, and the Eastern Peninsula is mostly avoided.
The Humanoids

A sighting of one these figures from afar
Aside from squids, various human-like figures can also be found in Purple Plus. They are usually found wandering throughout the verse by themselves. However, once someone comes within around 2 to 3 km of one of them, they will alert others and summon a swarm of trillions, possibly quadrillions of them. These swarm are nigh-unstoppable and will destroy anything in their path. They seem to feed on the verse itself, and can leave behind vast empty spaces of nothingness. With enough time, the verse will regenerate itself and fill in these gaps with more purple substance.

The Machines
[
]
Groups of spherical, mechanical objects can be found travelling through Purple Plus at very fast speeds. The members of these groups form straight lines. They ignore squids and humanoids, but upon spotting foreign entities, they will unleash large gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and destroy them. They seem to have been built for the purpose of protecting Purple Plus, but it is unknown who or what created them. The only known way to avoid these machines is to play the music of
Wrathful Elevator
, which, for still unknown reasons, the machines appear to be frightened of.
The Islands
[
]
Very rarely, large floating island can be found inside the verse. They are usually empty, although some have ruins of ancient buildings and structures. These structures, along with the machines and ruins of alien ships which can be found very sparsely throughout Purple Plus. It is unknown what this civilization called themselves, and it is also not known what led to their downfall.
The Garage
[
]
The Garage
can be found in the Southern Peninsula of Purple Plus. For aforementioned reasons, machines rarely inhabit this area, although squids and humanoids can still be found.
