CNLS (aka Cosmic Nebula like Space) is an object located some where in
omniverses
. It's not contained by anything except omniverses. It's a nebula shape galaxy structure that compared to omniverses, is very super small but still bigger than most
universes
.
it has a lot of
stars
and nebulas (smaller white dots in image).
There's a very massive object in the center that is very bright and very big, but for its size its very dense and if laid out to density of average black hole it would be double the size of this object. It is very important because it has the role of a supermassive black hole in center of a galaxy, everything orbits it, and it keeps the object together. If it disappears, all objects and gases that form this structure will expand and fade out. The exact origin of this object is unknown.
