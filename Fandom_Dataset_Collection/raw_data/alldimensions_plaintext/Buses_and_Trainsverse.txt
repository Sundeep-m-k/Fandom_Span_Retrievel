The Buses and Trainsverse is a verse that contains a very high quantity of buses and trains. The delusional and often
erotomanic
residents believe that both of these are better than cars, so as a result, there do not exist any cars in the Buses and Trainsverse. If you get seen with a car here, you get killed by the people here without mercy because of that delusion and your car will get smashed to bits and thrown in the junkyard.

Buses
[
]
The buses are land vehicles with wheels that traverse the roads based on a set route, stopping at several bus stops along the way. In practice, any person can stand near a bus stop, wait for the bus to arrive, and then board the bus so it takes that person to the desired location. In some situations, buses have different lanes, so they do not get slowed down by other potential traffic. If they did not have designated lanes, they would get slowed down by other potential traffic, meaning they would move at the same speed as cars, but have the disadvantage of having a requirement to stop at several bus stops, as well as not being able to create direct paths from point A to B. However, since the Buses and Trainsverse does not have any cars, this traffic problem does not exist, so the buses are free to use the roads, without the requirement of any bus lanes.
Trains
[
]
Trains are vehicles that traverse people on railways. Most trains in the Buses and Trainsverse are subway trains, which reside under the ground. All around the Buses and Trainsverse are stations called train stations, which are typically installed in high-population areas where many people would want to visit them. Then, the underground trains provide direct connection between each of these stations, allowing any person to use one or more of them to quickly get from one station to another. Trains are not limited by traffic. Also, they consist of many linked cars, all propelled by a single engine, saving energy.
The Lack of Cars
[
]
The Buses and Trainsverse does not have any cars, because cars are bad and get smashed to pieces here. Cars are absolutely useless and any car seen will get smashed and recycled to make a bus/train.Buses and Trainsverse delusional people think: "Cars only create more traffic and should not be used as primary means of transportation."
The Cloud Thing
[
]
There is a Cloud Thing floating in the sky of the Buses and Trainsverse. Nobody knows why it is there, but it is there. It is so far useless and sometimes a nuisance because it darkens the sky and bus with no headlights crash into each other. One time, someone used a very tall ladder to reach it and jump on it, thinking it was solid. It was not, so the person fell through it and landed in a bush. The person looked up and there were three buses moving past the bush at the same time, which had the numbers 8, 18, and 32. The person noticed that all of these were equal to two times that of three consecutive perfect squares. That is essentially the only noteworthy thing that has happened related to the Cloud Thing.
