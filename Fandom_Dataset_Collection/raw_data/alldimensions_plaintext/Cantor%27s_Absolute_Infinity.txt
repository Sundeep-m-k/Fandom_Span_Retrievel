Cantor's Absolute Infinity
was an infinity proposed by Cantor that made up the collection of all ordinals. Due to the requirement of ordinals to be well-ordered, this is not itself an ordinal.
It is commonly denoted with the symbol
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
.
Proof
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
is not an Ordinal
[

Suppose
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
is an ordinal. Then
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
has an ordinal successor
Ω
+
{\displaystyle \Omega^+}
and
Ω
∈
Ω
+
{\displaystyle \Omega \in \Omega^+}
. But
Ω
+
{\displaystyle \Omega^+}
is an ordinal, so
Ω
+
∈
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega^+ \in \Omega}
. Since ordinals are well-ordered by
∈
{\displaystyle \in}
,
Ω
+
∈
Ω
+
{\displaystyle \Omega^+ \in \Omega^+}
, but this violates the requirement for a well-ordering to be well-founded, so, by contradiction,
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
is not an ordinal.
