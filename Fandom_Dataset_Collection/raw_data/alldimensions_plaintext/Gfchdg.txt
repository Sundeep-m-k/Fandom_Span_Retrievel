Gfchdg is a strange hole on a small planet. Falling through it
can make you land in any place throughout
Alphasm's imagination
, although the most common spot is
Unexistence
.
Gfchdg is pretty small, being
only 5 meters long and wide
. There have been many attempts to widen the hole, with all of them proving unsuccessful as anything trying to enlarge the hole will glitch to
Unexistence
.
Gfchdg will close every 15.635
OYC
, and will remain closed for about 3
OYC
. Every time this happens, Gfchdg will appear in a new location on the planet it is in. This location will always be on land, and never in water or in the air.
Creatures that have fallen through Gfchdg have reported to have seen random locations all across the AD cosmology show up all around them.
Once a creature has fallen into Gfchdg, they will not be able to get out of the hole until they reach the end, as a black, void-like substance completely envelops them once they are falling through.
