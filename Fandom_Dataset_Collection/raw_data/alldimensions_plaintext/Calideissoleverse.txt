The Calideissoleverse (or Calidisleverse) is a theoretical verse inspired by a web series called
What If?
. In this particular What If? we explore the various effects of an indestructible hair dryer that is capable of outputting an insane amount of heat. In this case up to 11 petawatts. The Calideissoleverse is based on the thought experiment that if there were such a hair dryer, and we could put it into a universe and turn it at a very high amount of power, how hot would it get. In this case, it would end up at around 6 trillion °K.
