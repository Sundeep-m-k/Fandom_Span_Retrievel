About
[
]
Endlessythings
(colloquially called
Endlessliatoms
) are the atomic-like
particle
equivalents of the
√ã≈ï≈ó≈ç≈ôverses
, and the the most extreme atoms in
class 29
and possibly in
TEPH
in general. They build up √ã≈ï≈ó≈ç≈ôverses unlike normal
atoms
. There are waves and disks which surround them. Also, Endlessythings don't make up
elements
, rather they are particles which build up to form the larger
verses
, and nothing else.
Endlessythings build up only by their extremity. When there's more, it enables them more to stick up and build larger, kind of like they're more stable. But since there's a lot of
void
, this might
not
go well. The things which revolve and surrounds them actually does the job. Those disks are sticky so that Endlessythings can build up. Also, all the Endlessythings are the box of all the atoms and verses smaller than themselves, which contributes a lot to the extremity. Because of this, they are possibly the most stable atoms of all of TEPH and below.
Bondings
[
]
Unlike normal atomic bonds, they bond not by any forces but by simply touching other Endlessythings. This also means their bonds can be broken if they manage to get separated from eachother by something or someone.
