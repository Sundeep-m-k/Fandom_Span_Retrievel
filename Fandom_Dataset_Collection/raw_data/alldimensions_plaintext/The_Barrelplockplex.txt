There is too much pizzazz, we are all gonna die! -the barrel
This place has WAY WAY WAY WAY too much pizzazz. And pizzas. Dead pizzas, mostly. The pizzas all originated from the large number of leaks present in the
The Barrelplock.
s, in which dough and cheese shot out like a fountain and combined together to create pizzas. These pizzas were then covered in plastic bags and went all over everyone's knuckles, so most of the pizzas died.
Origins

]
The Barrelplock.s were getting too big in number, and many collided with each other. The ones that collided usually never got apart until they separated but stayed attached, and eventually they would reach a maximum size where all new The Barrelplock.s would remove an existing The Barrelplock.. From it, so now almost all The Barrelplock.s are inside a Barrelplockplex, a collection of The Barrelplock.s.
