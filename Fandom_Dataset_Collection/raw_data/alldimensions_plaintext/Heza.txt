Heza is the smallest known variant of
Heck
, being much smaller than
Absolutely tiny uqraek fiber
. Heza is absolutely untraceable, being so incredibly small that no being (besides
daves
) can see it. Hezas aren't actually supposed to exist. They are basically malfunctioned "Pre-hecks", that failed to grow above the first threshold.
