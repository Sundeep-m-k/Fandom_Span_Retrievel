Matter for use by
The Cosmological Recycler
The recycle realm is an isolated infinite void for stored matter that will be later used by
The Cosmological Recycler
in the recycling process. It has 3 special laws of physics for proper storage:
1. Matter in RR may not interact with other matter.
2. Radioactive matter in RR may not radiate.
3. Matter in RR may not escape RR.
RR can have multiple dimensionalities at once to contain matter of other dimensionalities.
