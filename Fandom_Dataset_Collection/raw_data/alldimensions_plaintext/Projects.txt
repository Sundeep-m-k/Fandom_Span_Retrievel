Projects are a scientific effort to learn more about a subject. In Hypercosmology, a project can range from studying a single verse, to studying a broad group of them! A project's members can range from whole laboratories, private corporations, singular researchers, all the way to amateurs.

Priority
[
]
A project's priority can range wildly, from useless to absolutely necessary. I will now list the priority ratings.
ע
[
]
Projects that are of no importance to the wider Hypercosmology community. This is often relegated to projects studying minor verses.
α
[
]
Projects that are of little importance to the field of Hypercosmology.
β
[
]
Projects that are of minor but notable importance to Hypercosmolgy.
γ
[
]
Projects that are of medium importance to Hypercosmology. These are the lowest priority projects that major Hypercosmological organizations such as the H.C.L.O.
[
1
]
involve themselves with.
δ
[
]
Projects that are of significant importance to Hypercosmology.
ω
[
]
Projects that are of very high importance to Hypercosmology. These projects will often be talked about outside of the Hypercosmology community if public.
א
[
]
Projects that are of top importance to Hypercosmology. These projects will often be all the rage both inside and outside of the Hypercosmology community if public.
Secrecy
[
]
A projects secrecy, like it's priority, can range wildly. From Public to Top Secret, I will list each now.
ע
[
]
Public. Self explanatory.
α
[
]
Protected. Publicly accessible, but not able to be contributed to unless given permission.
β
[
]
Restricted. Not necessarily private, but often just hidden or behind lax security.
γ
[
]
Confidential. Projects locked behind minimal security.
δ
[
]
Classified. Projects locked behind medium security. Leaking these projects will likely lead to minor consequences.
ω
[
]
Secret. Projects locked behind high security. Leaking these projects will likely lead to medium consequences.
א
[
]
Top Secret. Projects locked behind top security. Simply accessing these projects without permission will likely lead to dire consequences.
Special
[
]
These Priority/Secrecy Ratings are used very rarely, and should be used sparingly.
Priority
[
]
פּ
[
]
Projects whose priority rating is pending. Often used for new or obscure projects.
ת
[
]
Projects that are of the absolute most importance. These projects often investigate the fundamental truths of the Hypercosmos
[
2
]
. These projects are often kept secret.
Secrecy
[
]
פּ
[
]
Similarly to the פּ priority rating, this rating is used for projects whose secrecy rating is still pending.
ת
[
3
]
[
]
Projects which are kept so secret, that this rating itself is kept secret. These are often locked behind security so tight, that there would be no hope for getting even the tiniest peek.
