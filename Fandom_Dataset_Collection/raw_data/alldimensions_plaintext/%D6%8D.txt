Is a large number that explains how large Minden is.

Let's get to the math of this and how big it really is.
֍ = ((Number of
Mindenspheres
)^^^(Allpshere light year expansion rate number of ^'s)^^^
ש
)^(The Minden Void expansion rate)
Let's break it down, shall we?
[

Number of Mindenspheres: This is the current number of Mindenspheres, which is a VERY large number, just to say.
Allsphere light year expansion rate: This is the rate that the Allsphere expands in light years per OYC. It's not as big as the number of Mindenspheres, but it is closer to
🦠
PV.
Minden Void expansion rate: This is similar to the Allsphere expansion rate, but is much lower in numbers.
