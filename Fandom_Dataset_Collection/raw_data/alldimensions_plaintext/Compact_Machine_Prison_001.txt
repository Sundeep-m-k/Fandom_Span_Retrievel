The satellite which houses CMP-001 in orbit of Lesaros
The
Compact Machine Prison 001
(commonly shortened to
CMP-001
) is a
compact machine
that houses an inescapable prison (almost). This compact machine is located inside a satellite in orbit of Lesaros, a gas giant that shares the same star as the planet of the Sinari, which were the ones who created this satellite (UNI-3). It is used by the
Local Universal Alliance
to imprison beings who did really really bad things.

The satellite where CMP-001 is located in, called Satellite Prison 001 (SP-001), is a pretty uninteresting artificial satellite. Its main part is a cube 1.5 meters in side length, only occupied by the compact machine (1x1x1 meters). Along with the main part, SP-001 also has six solar panels (seen on the image), which are used primarily to wirelessly fuel the energy chips in the prisioners.

Layout of the inside of CMP-001 - Brown is a compact machine and grey is empty.This goes on up to the top.
The compact machine is a Maximum Compact Machine, having 2197 m
3
of volume. The inside area contains 1300 Tiny Compact Machines that are the cells. The layout of the tiny compact machines is so that all of the machines are accessible.
Cells
[
]
The cells are the compact machines that actually house the prisioners. These are specially designed to not have input/output hatches so that they don't escape by using the hatches.
Prisioners
[
]
Normally, the prisioners that are put in CMP-001 stay there until they die. Before they go there, they get inplanted with an energy chip that gives them energy without them needing food and is fueled by the satellite's solar panels.
Incidents

Unfortunately, compact machines are not perfect in imprisioning things. The walls of the machines are rich with dusts and pebbles of useful material, and with the necessary knowledge, people can break out. Normally, this is by
using the materials to create complicated machines that process more materials into tiny machines (giving the being 2 tiny machines to work with), and repeating this process and making more machines and larger compact machines until when they engineer a high-energy compactor and use it to create a material strong enough to break through the cell's walls
