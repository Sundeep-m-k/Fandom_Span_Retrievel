What is the
UNCONTAINABILITY OF ALL VERSES?
It is a verse that cannot be ‘contained’, ‘superceeded’, or ‘surpassed’ in any sense we have defined so far or any way that can reasonably attach to the word ‘contained’. Its size is defined as Ω
מin
(☒☒
Ω
מin
)
, ☒☒ in Metafinities meaning uncontainable, or in this case, nothing can be larger than it, in a sense. ☒☒
1
means nothing can be larger than that number, but you can surpass it, blah blah, ☒☒
2
means you can’t surpass it, and so on. Therefore, TUOAV cannot be contained in ANY SENSE, as ☒☒
Ω
is a number that can’t be surpassed in any way, sort of like an End-All-Be-All, but for numbers.
The only thing that is able to be ‘above’ it is
The Eternality of all Verses
, which as the name suggests is ETERNAL. It can do this using ☒☒☒
Ω
. So if ☒
Ω
is impassibility and ☒☒
Ω
is uncontainability, ☒☒☒
Ω
must be the next tier of uncontainability, which we’ll just call eternality. We may also write ☒
3
to signify this, where the “3” you see is the number of “☒”s.
After that, is the Divergentality of All Verses (
TDOAV
), symbolised by ☒
4
, each next tier of four ☒☒☒☒ diverging from the normal… anything. But that is far beyond our page, so for now, just follow through to
TENOAV
(The ‘en’ is to distinguish it from regular.
