4M 6394-01
is a
Universe
. It has a total of 30 billion stars, making it very densely packed for its size.
Structure
[
]
This universe is another fixed size verse, with a cosmic web area at the edge. There is a massive black hole at the core of this verse, called S1234 with a mass of 100 billion
Suns
. Everything in this universe orbits slowly around this one black hole. This black hole sometimes causes planet orbits to tilt.
Properties
[
]
Collisions in space in this universe are very rare. This is because there is a strange law in here that nothing can go past the speed limit of two meters a second. There are two types of planets in this universe: terrestrial planets and gas giants.
Unlike most other universes, red shifts are actually very common due to the movement of the stars and the amount of stars. However, these red shifts usually only last about 12 seconds.
Brebeans
[
]
The strangest property of this universe that no other discovered universe has is the fact that it has Brebeans. Brebeans are large structures that are kind of like
Superclusters
, but they float around fast and there are a lot of them. These are bean-shaped, and usually contain extremely densely packed stars and galaxies. However, these have been proved to not orbit around S1234 due to the rotations it has with other superclusters. It is unknown why Brebeans don't orbit it, but it could be due to its high mass.
