Negatime and negareality
is a point in the entire everything where time and reality don't exist. Everything doesn't exist, but exists itself. Structures in the negatime and negareality point are absolutely violent and nonsensical, creating ultimate collapses and fuses resulting in powerful destruction and creation of more violent and bigger objects.
Deep negareality
[
]
Deep negareality is the point where everything is absolutely distorted and chaotic. Everything there is so nonsensical and ultimate to the point where it is not even describable. Nothing else is known about deep negareality, other than its omega, nonsensical and indescribable structures. If you keep going farther into the deep negareality, you'll exit the entire dimension and verse hierarchy. Everything there becomes so weird they may not even be called verses or dimensions.
