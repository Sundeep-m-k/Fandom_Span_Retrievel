Image of Fake Windowsverse as it was 10-23 years ago
Fake Windowsverse is a smaller
Windowsverse
, composes of
Fake Googleverse
and other
Fake Softwareverses
throughout this verse. It is an example of lots of
Fake Operationverses
, the largest of them all. Strangely that it has many older versions of it, each one of them is more modern than the previous one. There are also
Fake Virusverses
that attacks any Fake Operationverse that are in
Fake Computerverse
, so that they make them unable to use. Fortunately, the recent they are used by
TOGs
, the less have exist.
Because there are many more Fake Operationverses other than this, the below heading has info about them.
