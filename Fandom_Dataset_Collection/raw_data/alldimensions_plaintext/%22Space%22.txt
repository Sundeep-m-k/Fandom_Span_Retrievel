Fun fact: this is also a "entity"! Like time, space is existential, and while TIME is judgement, Space is Possibility for what that judgement might beso TIME is judgement, while SPACE is the Possibility for that Judgement to appear
Space
is the concept of distance of the area of
reality
and such, space means many things, personal, mental, digital, whatever the case may be, however space is commonly three dimensional in our universe however in many other
Verses and such
that may not be the case since there are infinite variations of infinite realities, dimensions, and timelines, and even existence as a whole, without space how can existence exist? Without space, existence itself would be impossible because space provides the necessary framework for matter, energy, and
time
to interact, allowing for motion, differentiation, and structure; without it, there would be no separation between objects, no dimensions to define position, and no possibility for anything to manifest in any meaningful way, and that's not complicated (ok maybe a lil bit), space provides possibility, position, and anything to exist and be defined and that is extremely helpful because all dimensions wiki ultra cosmology is extremely big like really big, too big but never too big it is expanding automatically with ever user in the community of AD and I like that, you exist in
real life
which is Meta-Class 1(maybe that?) and anything in meta class 2 is beyond real life and real life is in the ALLSPHERE which is every version of reality imaginable and unimaginable, good that's nice but how did all of that get here? SPACE AND TIME, the allsphere probably couldn't exist without distance and area and a passage of motion to move forward into the future
Without space, nothing would even exist, and that is a truth, it's extremely honest(btw likefirm told me since TIME IS JUDGEMENT, SPACE would be order and I think that makes sense)
