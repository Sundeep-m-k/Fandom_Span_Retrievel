Five

,

Cinco

) are one of the more elusive verses in the
One Chain
. No real picture has been taken of them, and they're the only known verses in the cosmos to be able to glitch to be an infinitely small point while containing
Fours
, which are far larger than themselves.

Structure
[
]
A Five's internal structure is almost impossible to see, since they're infinitely small. Only infinitely small creatures can actually see what is inside, and even they will most likely get glitched into
Unexistence
if they enter a Five.
It is still unknown how a Four can be contained in a Five, since even if Fives were to have huge concentrations of
Glitchonicite
, they could not contain more than an infinitely small quantity of it, since Fives are just as big as a point.
Theories to the Affect
[
]
There have been many theories proposed to solve this problem. So far, none have been perfect at solving this question.
Five Does Not Really Contain Four
[
]
This is the most popular theory among creatures in the cosmos, and states that Fives does not actually contain Fours, and it is
Sixs
that contain them instead. This is only due to ridiculously high amounts of
repulsive matter
and black holes in a Six, creating the illusion that Fives contain Fours, in which in reality Fives are just another particle floating around in their local Six. This theory has evidence, with point-like particles containing
Glitchonicite
found floating around in the Sixs.
Five Does Not Exist
[
]
This theory is probably the weirdest one of them all, and states that Fives don't exist in the first place. The creatures who support this theory point out that once you exit a Four, you will immediately get glitched to
Unexistence
, and that when you send light, sound waves, or any wavelength in the spectrum, they will immediately travel to a Six without passing through any other barrier, i.e. Fives.
This theory has been criticized by many due to the lack of evidence.
