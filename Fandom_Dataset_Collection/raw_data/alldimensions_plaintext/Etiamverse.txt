The Core has a size of

{\displaystyle \aleph_0}
and a mass of
ℵ
0
{\displaystyle \aleph_0}
. It's made entirely out of
Glitchonicite
. When any Glitchonicite is removed from the Core, it instantly regenerates. This has proven to be a great source of Glitchonicite for many civilizations. However, most civilizations don't use it, because it's too hard to get through the Inner Shell.
Inner Shell

The Inner Shell is the shell surrounding and protecting the Core. It's made of a material so strong that it can't be described in English. The only material stronger than this is the only material stronger than this is the only material stronger than this is the only material stronger than this... The Inner Shell also will regenerate any lost material in an

. Due to this, many entities have gotten stuck inside the shell or chopped in half while trying to harvest Glitchonicite from the Core.
Outer Shell

The outer shell is third and final shell of the Etiamverse. It's made of... well... pretty much... paper. This layer doesn't do much exciting. What kind of entity that's even interested in harvesting Glitchonicite from the Core wouldn't be able to break through paper? Even HUMANS can easily break through paper! So yeah, pretty pointless.
