Description
[
]
Zhexzaverse is a verse located in the
Zettaverse
, it is a very weird and interesting verse, the verse's class is unknown, but possibly class 2(?), it is a very very colorful verse, but sadly, has a little life, the only life are creatures, only one type, they are called "
Zhezxs
".
Zhezxs
[
]
Zhezxs are creatures living in zhexzaverse, they are not so friendly, they dont like new creatures going on their verse, so they kill them (Which leads to the answer of why only zhezxs live there), they love eating cookies and brainies, also some brainfunis, but mostly not, their diet is omnivore and they look like jelly red creatures.
History
[
]
The big xoz
[
]
The big xoz was a historical event happening at the first seconds zhexzaverse was born, it is known for being a really really beautiful big bang, the event horizon was red, purple and black (like zhexzaverse seen in the image by now), it is created by zhexz, the supreme ruler of the verse.
The first zhezxs
[
]
The first zhezxs were called "Anceozxs" from the known word "Ancestors", they are really really primitive and obviously, no anceozx lives as of to this date, they were actually friendly but lord zhexz were bored so he turned them bad, he can make zhezxs good any second, but he prefers not to due to boredom of his life, actually.. How does gods get created?
Primitzhezx age
[
]
From the word primitive, this is like the primitive age for the humans, zhezx(s) have now some stone and wood tools, they dont really look like modern zhezxs, they look like monkezexzes, everyone cares about himself, no families, death every second, doom, doom, and doom, did i say doom? ah yeah.
Modzhexz age
[
]
The modern age of the zhezxs, the current age of them, i would have known since i am zhexz, but i dont wanna spoil the future, so in the history there wont be something like "Futuzhexz age" or "Futzhexz", so i can make it later, by now, its probably the future, but who knows, since i am young, what can i even do about
time and reality
? nothing, so no future age.
