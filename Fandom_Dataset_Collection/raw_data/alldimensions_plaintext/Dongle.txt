Microscopic view of dongle inside a body.
dongle
is a virus that can be found throuought our
Megaverse
that is incredibly versatile, being able to affect almost any living being within. The main symptom is the victim being transformed into a dongle over the course of around 3 weeks.
History
[
]
In 16/8/2024, dongle was anomalously manifested into a random habited planet when a
Transcendent Omni-God
posted "dongle" on the AD Discussions page.
The post that started it all.
In 2031, dongle was declared a multiversal threat by most civilisations, and by 2099 the entire kiloverse was on lockdown. The first vaccine for dongle was the TG vaccine in 2132, having a 60% success rate.
Luckily due to the lockdown, humanity was safe from dongle until after they all got the vaccine. However, 6% of all humans still turned into dongles due to being anti-vaxxers that have a soft spot in the middle of their heads.

Transmission
[
]
dongle can be transmitted by electrical signals and sometimes the air. Some rare dongle viruses can convert themselves into a
Propar
