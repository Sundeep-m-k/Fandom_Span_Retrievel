The
Uniperaverses
exist in a
new
class
of
verses
altogether. They contain the
Peraomniversal Complexes
, which in turn contain all of the
3rd-
class verses
.
Like all types of
peraverses
, they exist in the perareality, at a point on the "path" of nested realities that intersects with the unireality, our reality, but at a different angle, leading to some unique features and some inherited features from the unireality. Structure is partially affected by this angle, but only at small scales. Larger scales are less affected; they are closer to an axis unaffected by the angle.
Due to the overlap here, if you attempt to enter the spaces between the Peraomniversal Complexes within, you'll either fall back down into a random unireality, or you'll forced back into the closest Peraomniversal Complex.
Civilizations
have exploited this feature to instantly communicate over extremely long distances.
It is also a failsafe for if you attempt to go sub-
Blueprint Particles
. Instead of ending up at a lower scale, you will go all the way here. In a way, this makes the Uniperaverses
techinally
sub-Blueprint Particles, but it isn't really; the Blueprint Particle is the "bottom", and thus, you cannot go below it.
Experienced
Metaversers
can easily treat regular verses like the Metaverse, allowing mapping the hacking of a
xoꓭ
particles
onto "breaking Blueprint Particles", allowing them to reach this type of verse as well.
Structure
[
]
The Uniperaverses are lava orbs with gas rings radiating from their orb every second. The lava orb on their surface appears to resemble the early universe, but on a much larger scale. They are made of extremely "bouncy" Peraomniversal Complexes that give off 10 watts of pera-energy per second.
This pera-energy goes to the core, an entangled space due to
pera-years
of interaction with the bounciness of the surface. The core then takes this pera-energy, and uses it to produce
Peraatoms
in order to speed up the gathering of energy. This is caused by the Peraatoms out of whack string that vibrates more and more from the energy within the Uniperaverse, causing a significantly multiplied charge. This leads to exponential insanity, and interesting fractal structures within the core of the Uniperaverses, like
Mandelbrotverses
.
