Whole Space
has somewhat become a waypoint for authors, archivists and artists from across all space and time to observe its contents. One such species, known by many as the Zealots, have called
Whole Space
their home, feeding off the columns. Attempts have been made to cull the Zealot infestation, but have failed time and time again due to the nature of
Whole Space

Whole Space
isn't composed of any matter per say, but rather a composite jelly substance unlike anything else.
Locations within Whole Space
[
]
Whole Space
is split into many different segments outlining different parts of intelligent life:
Iron Space:
A place in which thoughts, concepts and ideas are crammed into every crevice, making it impossible to traverse without facing insanity from your mind being overrun with information.
Art Space:
A less volatile location in which the creativity of intelligent life is on display to all. Here you can see some of the best artwork your imagination could ever dream of.
Blank Space:
An area in which any kind of thoughts or ideas are few and far between, completely devoid of anything.
Unspace or No Space:
Perhaps one of the more dangerous verses, this area has been listed as a conceptual annihilator. Basically it destroys thoughts, ideas and concepts. Luckily it is kept hidden, locked away in Blank Space.
