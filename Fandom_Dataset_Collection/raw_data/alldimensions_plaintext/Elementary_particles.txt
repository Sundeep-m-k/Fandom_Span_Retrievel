In particle physics an
elementary particle
or
fundamental particle
is a subatomic
particle
that is not composed of other
particles
. Particles currently thought to be elementary include
electrons
, the fundamental
fermions
(
quarks
,
leptons
, etc. which generally are
matter
particles and antimatter particles), as well as the fundamental
bosons
, which generally are force particles that mediate interactions among fermions. A particle containing two or more elementary particles is a composite particle.
