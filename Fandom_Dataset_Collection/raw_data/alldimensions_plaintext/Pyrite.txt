— Pyrite
Pyrite is a gem that likes killing. that's it. Yep. She's not really that powerful, with a
DPRS
power rating of 1K, which is high for human-level beings but miniscule for All Dimensions standards. The thing that actually gives her power is her gun, which weirdly changes from an AK-47 to a shotgun sometimes, meaning it has a bit of magic on it, perhaps. She makes money from selling
dysprosium
. She lives in
Earth 2
, in Uzbekistan. She also travels throughout all of the
archverses
and structures here.
Her story is still in development, so stay tuned!

Powers
[
]
So, here are Pyrite's powers!!!1
no need oxygen nor temperature!!
[
]
Pyrite doesn't need to breathe (she doesn't even have a fucking nose) nor could she die from cold/hot stuff, which means she can survive in space.
solar light powers!!
[
]
Pyrite can use solar rays to boost herself, becoming extremly bright and being capable of burning / blinding enemies (temporarily giving her 10kpow's)! So overpowered!!11
Power Stats
[
]
so, here are her stats
Power: 1K
Ability-Power: 50
Attack: 1.5K
Defense: 0.75 (she can shatter)
Agility: 5
Fights
[
]
Since the All Dimensions wiki basically only has ultra-mega-omni-end-all-be-all-deity-beings, this section is pretty much useless, because Pyrite would just be absolutely be obliterated, unfortunately.
She is in the
Multicellular life
tier in the Cosmic Entity hierarchy.
Theres a bunch of AD entities she DOES beat tho, like for example
Bauti
and
Newfall

(which are basically normal humans lol).
Affiliation
[
]
She normally stays neutral, if neutral means killing both sides. Basically a chaotic neutral.
If we could count an actual "affiliation" for her, it could be the one related to the dysprosium mines, "Dysp-X". She really isn't too much into it, but she sometimes helps.
Companies
[
]
Dysp-X: She's pretty cool with them, they are the supplier of her dysprosium
The Really Cool Reviewing Cosmic Corporation
: On bad terms, she tried bombing their headquarters once. It didn't go that well.
Omniversal
: She hates the syntax and tried to kill the owners over the fact that there are semicolons.
DeltaTech
: "wtf is a mathematics spreader" - Pyrite
Automate Industries
: She thinks they're fine
Job
[
]
Pyrite makes money by selling dysprosium and other metals in a shop named "los dysprosiums" which has a secret base underground with a biochemical arsenal. This is secretly a corporation known as "Dysp-X", secretly waiting to grow enough to start a cosmic conquering crusade... spooky! Spoiler: this probably wont work at all.
Story
[
]
She was born in 1969. In her early childhood she grew very fond of murdering things, and destroyed thousands of ant colonies. In 2833, she was put in
Compact Machine Prison 001
because of her war crimes, however she got out in a year.

she can't die of old age due to her being a mineral (they last a lot of time!). In fact, when time passes she slowly gets stronger due to her mineral body becoming stronger.
she was born in July 20th 1969. This matches with a very special event, when humans reached the moon for the first time!

Fun fact: these pages were made by a 7 year old (yes its completly unironical) and they're probably vandalized by now because of that.
