The
Mandelbroth
is a very large "pot" filled with a very hot, very watery
broth
. The Mandelbroth does not actually contain any verses, and the
Purple Pluses
revolve AROUND it.
The Mandelbroth can be accessed in every verse via a cosmic entity known as Skriikn. Skriikn will go to every single verse in Alphasm's imagination and place a wormhole in a random location in the verse. It can do this extremely fast. Skriikn, when not creating wormholes in other verses, is usually seen being very close to the Mandelbroth, apparently enjoying itself very much.
The Mandelbroth always remains hot no matter what. It is unknown how this happens, although most creatures say that the broth inside of it is keeping the Mandelbroth at a high temperature.
As the Mandelbroth is very, very hot, many creatures who are living in cold verses go through the wormholes which Skriikn created and warm themselves and sometimes their entire home verse up. Most creatures leave very fast, as the Mandelbroth radiates enough heat to potentially burn a verse in only 5 hours.
Contrary to popular belief, the broth inside of the Mandelbroth IS actually safe to drink, although creatures who drink it will usually not feel very good after drinking such a hot broth. Due to this, no creatures except for Skriikn drinks from the Mandelbroth except when they are cold. Contrary to popular belief, Mandelbroth can also be turned cold by mixing it with ethanol, which makes it safe and pleasant to drink and not poisonous.
