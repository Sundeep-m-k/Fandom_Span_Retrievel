Red holes
are one of the rarest occurrences in our
Quettaverse
. They have only a 1 in a duocentillion chance of forming. They are usually extremely small, yet can be extremely big if under the right circumstances.
Description
[
]
The rare "red holes" are similar to black holes, yet are vastly different. Instead of warping time if you get close to them, they warp space, sending you anywhere in the omniverse. These can very rarely send you to a different timeline, just as black holes can sometimes teleport you. Smaller ones can teleport you shorter distances, and bigger ones can teleport you further distances.
Formation
[
]
Red holes form when two distorted atoms(atoms that have been distorted through space and time, coming from either black holes or other red holes). If these atoms hit each other, they form a red hole, that increases in size depending on the amount of speed the atoms hit each other at. two distorted atoms even being in the same universe is rare as it is, let alone them coming near each other. This is why higher civilizations treasure them so much.
Destructive Power
[
]
Red holes are extremely destructive, due to them sending atoms and smaller particles anywhere in the omniverse. Just one atom-sized one can destroy an entire
Megaverse
. Because of this, civilizations who utilize them have to extremely cautious when harnessing them, as one slip-up could cost them their civilization and decillions of others.
