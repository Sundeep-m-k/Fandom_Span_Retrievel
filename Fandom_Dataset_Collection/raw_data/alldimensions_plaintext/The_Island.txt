The Island
Scale
Size
13 feet diameter (3.96 meters), at least 50 cubic feet in volume (1.416 cubic meters)
It is a simple floating island in the vast sea of emptiness. Located at the borders of known space in our
Realm
, it contains almost nothing.
The only thing that sits on The Island is a tree, worn away by countless eternities of resting on The Island. Its purpose is unknown, if it even has a purpose. This seemingly lifeless tree does not do anything, and just stays where it is.
The reason why this island is even here is ambiguous at best.
