Everything that has normal math, as we understand it.
The Math Field is probably the biggest verse that ever exists. It is a space where all math is the same. Inside this verse, you can make any math equation and they'll give all the same output for each function if you are inside The Math Field. If you are outside it, everything starts to "break down". Examples: outside the TMF, a circle with diameter 1 might have a circumference of 1,
2
0
{\displaystyle 2^0}
could be 0, and so on. Since this is seemingly impossible with our reality, the TMF could be the largest thing ever.
