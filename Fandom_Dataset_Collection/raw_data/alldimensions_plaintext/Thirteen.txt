Thirteen
(
Grob'be
in
The Pencil Language
or
Tradak
in Future English) is the next verse after
Twelve
, and is a very weird, "solid verse" or sorts. It is also considered unlucky.
Appearance
[
]
Thirteen appears to be a relatively normal watery planet. From the inside, Thirteen appears to be entirely black, just like the previous verses in the Eleven and One Chain.
Structure
[
]
Thirteen has a shallow, watery surface with an extremely tough and thick layer of rock underneath it. At the center of Thirteen lies a very weird, "colorless" and lawless space that holds exactly 13 Twelves in a
Protoverse
. This space, other than holding 13 Twelves, also contains many "holes" that will lead into a "in-between" space completely devoid of anything.
