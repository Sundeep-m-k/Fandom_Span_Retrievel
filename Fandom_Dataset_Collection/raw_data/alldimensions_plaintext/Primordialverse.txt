The
Primordialverse
is a set of mini-realities un-enterable and un-exitable without god level power. It is very similar to the
Omniverses
and
Boxes
, but with some small distinctions, it was also one of the first things to exist, even before time. It is named after the being which controls it, known as the
Primordial
, which existed from the instant of its creation. Its verses are in general a lot more odd and exotic.
It was created before time and space, or even existence itself, mostly composed made out of
Primordium Delta
, the most potent, powerful and strong substance that can or could exist. It eventually formed little pockets of empty space which it filled with matter, creating most normal types of verse and dimension within it (Universes, Multiverses, Megaverses). Many of these pockets became erratic and split off and created alternate realities, called the
Universe Swarm
which became so numerous in ended up containing it entirely.
There are 3 small pocket dimensions circling all the other infinite ones, this includes:
Zoid
,
HIS HOME
, and Voodid.
HIS HOME
is where the Primordial lives. The layout and composition of this place is made purely of
Primordium Alpha
.
