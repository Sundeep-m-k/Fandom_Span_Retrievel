the infraverse is a verse that contains infinite amounts of archverses.
The infraverse is a verse located in the
omniverse
, the verse itself is a
archverse
, but its not exactly, archverses are verses you will find all over the omniverse, tho the infraverse is a archversed-like verse, it is not, by that i mean that this is a verse thats bigger than the
hyperverse
, that is infact so big that if you try thinking about it your brain dies, so theres a whole different category for it.

The size, of the infraverse, is so huge that its isnt small enough that we can know what hes real size, some say that its 74,842 times bigger than the
hyperverse
, but the truth..
The true size of it
[

the true size of it, a impossible question, but is it tho? we know the size of
hyperverse
so is it so impossible that we cant know its real size? well, we ALREADY know the size of it, but your brain dies thinking of it, thats why we made "the Antibraindamage machinyplex"
The Antibraindamage machinyplex

by the name, you know, anti brain damage all that boring stuff, but no one really tried it, why you ask? they are scared that this wont work, so there was a brave man that were called "snoobs chicken" he will try it, wish him luck.

of course, he didnt died, it was all a theory that people tought its still unsafe and could kill them, but hes brain was big too, the infraverse was no challenge for him, the size is..
True size

so after snoobs chicken did it, he said the size was so large, massive, that its a planck length theory compared to this;
"76 RN (rayo's number) x 457 Qa googoltolls" which leads to 34732 tree(3)s"

the infraverse is a verse containing some archverses, like the box containing all the space this contains archverses, not all but most, the infraverse is a verse that can easily be unrecognisable by some people, its so huge that this is why you cant recognize it that good, but snoobs chicken recognised it VERY gooooooooood.
