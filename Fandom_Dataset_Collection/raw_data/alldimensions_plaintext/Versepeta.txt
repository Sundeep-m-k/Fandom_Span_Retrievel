Versepetas
(also known as Femtoverses) are opposite of
Petaverses
, making them a part of
Verseuni Chain
. They look like blue Mandelbrot set with a lot of various webs that contains many
Verseexas
which are constantly moving around. The
Versepeta
itself is a structure in the center (look at the image), Unlike
Petaverses
, its very cold there and almost no life, even smol entities cannot survive here.
Center
[
]
The
Versepeta'
s center contains absolutely nothing. Some
Verseexas
will end up here and will eventually disappear, resulting a new
Verseexa
forming at the start of web. These cycles take about 0.4 Earth quectoseconds, but beings inside
Versepeta
will feel these cycles as 9-15 years.
