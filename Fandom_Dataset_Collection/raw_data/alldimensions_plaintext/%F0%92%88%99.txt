Final Verse

SÅ«Å«kos

ð’ˆ™
is a verse directly contained by
the Final Verses
and on the same size level as
the Subfinal Verses
, but its absolute size is near impossible to measure. ð’ˆ™'s position is not innacessible from the Subfinal Verses, making it the first thing in our Final Verse ever landed on other than Subfinal Verses. ð’ˆ™ is composed of
SÅ«Å«ko
and various large verses. SÅ«Å«ko holds the verses in ð’ˆ™ in place, and accounts for greater than 10% and less than 40% of the space taken up inside ð’ˆ™.
As ð’ˆ™'s structure is unchanging, certain deviations in the integrity are evidence of collisions with other bodies of similar size. After these colissions, the things inside ð’ˆ™ seem to shift to things that should be impossible given the current
Laws
of
the First Realm
. As these collisions appear to follow a very complex pattern, it is possible that the laws of The First Realm change cyclicly, causing once stable positions for objects to become unstable and throwing other objects into ð’ˆ™. There seems to be a period lasting at least 700,000,000,000,000
OYC
in between each cycle, although most cycles are much longer.
Every 16.2 OYC, a celebration seems to occur, where enormus big-bang singularities the size of
Wekamultonic Geopamultons
are blasted out of ð’ˆ™  and
Spicespaces
of yellow, red, green, and many more are irradiated from it in 28 second bursts. this keeps happening for 13.0377
OYD
before stopping and happening again in another 16.2 OYC.
