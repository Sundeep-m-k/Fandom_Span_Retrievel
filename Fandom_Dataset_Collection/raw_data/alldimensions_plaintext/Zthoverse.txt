Zthoverses
are verses that can move, which also have a phenomenon named the "ztho dance", ocurring each ~325 trillion years on average. in this event the arms of the verses start moving and spinning very fast, along with the white central part (the Nucleus) of each arm constantly growing and shrinking.
Zthoverses have a life span of around 987 octodecillion (9,87*10
59
) years on average. Sometimes, big groups of zthoverses can be found, but most of the time there is only one zthoverse in their local
Infinite Infinity
.
For the most part, zthoverses have extremely low temperatures (-∞° to be exact), but both in the areas
Boxes
are located and in some specific voids the temperatures increase greatly to more normal standards, for some unknown reason. These are mostly located near the center of the zthoverses, the blue "arms" being the colder sections on most cases.

Civilization possibility
[
]
There is a 20% to 40% chance that there are developed civilizations inside of a zthoverse, the civilizations classified as "developed" need to reach a kardashev scale of AT LEAST 10, meaning they need to control a
Teraverse
, a
Geraverse
or any other verse classified as a 10 in the scale in order to meet the minimum requirements.
How to travel to and from the zthoverse
[
]
Traveling in the voids with higher temperatures.
Preventing getting close to the blue arms.
Parts
[

Nucleus
[
]
The white central part of this verse grows or shrinks in ztho dance activity. This part is the one that contains the boxes, and it darkens as you get closer.
Arm
[
]
This piece of the zthoverse moves the nucleus of the verse. Inside this piece are all the elements of the periodic table and antimatter mixed in the same way as the nucleus. Unlike the Nucleus, it turns white as you get closer.
