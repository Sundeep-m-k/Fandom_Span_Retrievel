The Isolated Dimension is a Reality contained by the
Metareality-Web
. It has a repulsive barrier around it so strong it that all
Metareality-Links
that were once connecting it to other realities were immediately destroyed and the space inbetween was pushed out leaving
Nothing
all around the universe making it impossible to enter without teleportation.
Even then the chaotic nature of the reality itself makes living in there, impossible. as such The Isolated Dimension is a desolate reality with no civilizations, or even stable particles for that matter.
