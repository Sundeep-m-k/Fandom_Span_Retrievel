The
Primordial Factories
are factories that create tons of
Primordial Baskets
every
Voidsecond
. All baskets created in them are transported to
Primordial Warehouses
. There is an entity that comes out of the smoke. It was called: “The Stuck”. The factories contain toxic items like radium green, which consists of a poison called arsenic.
Structure
[
]
Unlike other factories, these are rumored to be made by cyborgs. The factories are more of a demon’s house. The dimensions of the inside are different on the outside, so going into this place is very risky. There is a staff only door which leads to
something else…
People who venture there were never to be seen again.

The Stuck
Footage of the Stuck in a Primordial Factory. Cameraman presumed dead.
The Stuck is an entity that rarely appears in the factories, but when it does appear, it is extremely large and strong. It can be rarely seen, so don't worry. Just because of that, doesn't mean it's safe by the way.
