The Vauzverse, also known as the Imaginaryverse, is a verse with imaginary size, an imaginary number is a number which is neither positive or negative; square-rooting a negative number leads to this. This verse is relatively small (at least in terms of 'imaginary' small) and can be found within the reality known for containing many exotic materials, places, planets and verses, the
Primordialverse
.
There is a method to transport someone to this dimension, which is *currently* unused, due to its dangerousness. This involves using 2 devices to transform to this realm, 1 which transforms you into antimatter, and another which 'square-roots' any matter within it. To make sure your electrons (or rather positrons) stay with you, any positive mass is also converted to antimatter quickly and then negative-rooted (-√n), leading to -𝒊.
Imaginary Lifeforms
are a form of being found within this realm, and generate a special kind of energy known as 'Vauzian energy', and when used to power things can generate innumerable energy, even beginning to rival
Primordium Delta
's infinite raw power.
(Btw, I know that picture IS technically impossible, so just don't talk about it in the comments.)
