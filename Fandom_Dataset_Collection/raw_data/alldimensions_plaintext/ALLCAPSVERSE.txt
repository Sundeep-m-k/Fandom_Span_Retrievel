IN THIS VERSE, YOU CAN ONLY TALK IN CAPS, AND NOTHING ELSE.  IF YOU ARE EVER CAUGHT USING ANY FORM OF LOWERCASE CHARACTER INSIDE OF THIS VERSE, YOU WILL BE IMMEDIATELY SENT TO THE
CAPVOID.
THE ALLCAPSVERSE IS THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST THING IN THE CAP SCALED CONTINUUM, WITH IT'S "BORDERS" BEING
L I M I T S
.  WHENEVER YOU TRY TO ESCAPE THIS VERSE YOU WILL BE IMMEDIATELY SENT BACK, EVEN WITH ANY FORM OF GLITCHY/CORRUPTED MATERIAL.  HOWEVER, THERE IS A WAY TO SAY NON CAPITALIZED WORDS HERE; JUST GO TO THE EDGE OF THE ALLCAPSVERSE AND THROW THE UNCAPITALIZED TEXT/NOT LOUD SPEAKING OUTSIDE OF THE
L I M I T
AND SOMEHOW PULL IT BACK IN BEFORE IT IS SENT BACK TO A RANDOM POSITION. IF YOU DO THIS IN TIME, YOU WILL GET UNCAPITALIZED WORDS LIKE "egg" AND "cheese".
HOW TO ESCAPE IT.
[
]
THERE IS ONLY ONE KNOWN WAY TO ESCAPE THIS PLACE.  IT WAS DISCOVERED BY
CAPSTER
AN UNKNOWN TIME AGO. HE FIGURED OUT THE TRICK TO GETTING UNCAPITALIZED WORDS AND FIGURED OUT THAT IF YOU PUT ANY OBJECT OUT OF THE VERSE THEN BACK IN FAST ENOUGH, NOTHING WILL HAPPEN. HE USED THIS TRICK TO BUILD A CAP SHIP WHICH WENT OUTSIDE THE VERSE THEN BACK INSIDE THEN BACK OUTSIDE BEFORE THE VERSE COULD PROCESS THAT HE LEFT.  THIS CAUSED HIM TO BE THE FIRST EVER ESCAPE OF THIS VERSE. MANY MORE GODS USED THIS PROCESS TO ESCAPE THE ALLCAPSVERSE, AND MANY CIVILIZATIONS FIGURED OUT THIS TOO.
