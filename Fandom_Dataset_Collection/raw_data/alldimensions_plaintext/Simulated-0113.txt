Simulated-0113 is a pretty big supercomputer desinged to test how far the (sometimes in a comedic way) recursion and absurdity you see in this wiki can go, its probably the most powerful supercomputer ever invented at this time, as it can simulate pretty much anything, like literally, want a burger? sure, want a universe? sure! want a box-shaped verse that somehow contains itself and is contained by itself infinitely? absolutely yes!
Simulated-0113s sheer size is if you pretended the size is a blueprint particle, then make the size
(
protoverses larger, and pretend you're now at a protoverse, then make that size (
^(
universes larger, and then you reach a universe and make it (
^(^(
multiverses larger, and go on and on, to (ranks of) multiverses, metaverses, xenoverses, hyperverses, omniverses, climbing up the ranks, until you reach
The infinite void (currently empty page)
and make it (
^(^(^(^...
-verses of size 1+(
+(^(+(^(^(+...
larger, and now you reached the true size of Simulated-0113, or in other words, 2 @# (atantag units), yes its that ridiculously large (little side note, the reason its called Simulated-0113 is because its the 113th version of the supercomputer)
oh yea and about (, thats a unit that actually follows the same proccess as the simulated-0113s size calculation, but replace the ('s with Ω¶
Ω
Ω and do the proccess, replacing Ω¶
Ω
Ω with the output each iteration Ω¶
Ω
Ω @# (atantag units) times
Its shape is like any typical supercomputer, big box, lots of wires sticking out for some reason, switches, buttons, you get the idea
Where its in is
The simulation room
, a room where you guessed it,
the simulations
are made! its a dark gray room with lights, showing what state the supercomputer is in:
Red light: Simulation-crashing bug, fix as soon as possible
Orange light: Major bug, highly recommended to fix
Yellow light: Minor bug, recommended to fix
Green light: Everything is fine
Light of any other color: The lights are likely broken, recommended to fix the lights
