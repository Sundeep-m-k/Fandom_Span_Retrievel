Barrelplazia is the set of
Barrelplockinaguianas
. This is the only barrel in the series that can change colour via a function.
The Barrelplazia is divided into objects the size of a square millimeter, called Daniels. Every time Barrelplazia is touched by an object, every Daniel of its surface follows the following convention:
Take the current colour of the Daniel's hex code, and convert it to binary.
Take the binary code of any neighbouring Daniel and apply the NAND operator with it to receive a new binary code.
Convert the binary code back to hex, and then convert it to an RGB value (from 0 to 255).
Set the R value to 255 - R.
Set the G value to 255 - G.
Set the B value to 255 - B.
Convert the value back to hex, and then to binary.
Pick any other neighbouring Daniel and use the XOR operator with it.
Convert the resulting binary code back to hex, and make that the Daniel's new colour.

When alpha god mega doodle OOOOOO (Bongus, but pretending to be a different god) created this, he put a set of crap cards in it for people to find. However, they yeeted themselves out and turned into barrelblockinaguianas. The existing barrelplockinaguians also happened to be in it.
