Cosmic Entity
The Cosmic Face
is a Cosmic Entity that watches over everything beyond
The Box
. It keeps everything beyond The Box stable and well. It is a peaceful entity that doesn't attack anything unless they attack first. We do not know where
The Cosmic Face
comes from, but it may come from an even more powerful being. And yet, the
Cosmic Face
we see is not even the true form of
The Cosmic Face
, it is a mere avatar created by the
True Cosmic Face
that we can't even comprehend.
