Planetary system
Designations
Semi-major axis
Varies, in the AU scale
Physical characteristics
Composition
Usually solid substances like rocks, ice, molten metals, if gas planets are included then its up to those specific planets what they contain most of (hydrogen make up the majority nonetheless).
Most of the larger objects planetary systems contain are
stars
and
planets
.
Surface temperature
Anywhere in the plus/minus hundreds of °C

A
Planetary System
is a system of non-stellar natural satelites orbiting a central
star
. Sometimes, instead of orbiting one star, the planets can orbit around two stars in a binary system, or even a trinary system. This includes
planets
, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, etc. The stars can be of any luminosity, mass and diameter. Every star has its own habitable zone, which allows for certain planets within that region to be capable of having advanced life, thanks to appropriate conditions. Unlike the
solar system
, which also includes the star(s), the planetary system is only about the planets. As such, while the solar system can extend upwards of >1 light year, the planetary system only stretches to a couple astronomical units.
