The Frickverse is absolute frick. It contains all the frick ever, and thats it. It is contained by the Frickplex.
All of the things in the Frickverse are just
frick
and it doesn't contain anything else. This makes the Frickverse absolute frick because everything it contains is frick as well.
Unlike the
Frickckckckcckkckkcckckckckckverse
, the Frickverse does not have any
Xenoverses
inside it because frick is not delicate at all, and even though it contains more frick than the
Frickckckckcckkckkcckckckckckverse
contains Frickckckckcckkckkcckckckckck, it is smaller than the
Frickckckckcckkckkcckckckckckverse
because frick is more dense and can be compacted more than Frickckckckcckkckkcckckckckck.
