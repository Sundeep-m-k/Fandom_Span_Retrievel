Post-Absolutes
. They contain themselves in a loop
N E V E R
amount of times, being the reason for their name.

Voidancitium
[
]
Voidancitium
- main material from any Post-Never, also being an
Endlessradioactive
element. This element can kill everything except verses, being the reason why Post-Nevers have 0% chance of having life outside of their local verses. Post-Absolutes fortunately have protection agaisnt Voidancitium so thats why they can have life. In fact, Voidancitium is kind of able to form Post-Absolutes if they are in a certain quantity.
History of our Post-Never
[

This section also helps to know some of the information regarding the formation of Post-Nevers, since ours is a quite average one.

Post-N E V E R

- the formation of our
Post-Never
1
Voidsecond
- 1 Second after formation
- Voidancitium, the main element of this verse, is formed. History first time occurs.
1 Second - 1
OYC
after formation
- first and infinitesimall Post-Absolute formation happens thanks to the Voidancitium.
1 OYC - 1000 OYC after formation
- first formation of a Post-Absolute that isnt of ab infinitesimall size, since the Voidancitium starts spreading across the growing
Post-Never
.
Spread Era
[
]
1000 OYC - 17,692,300 OYC after formation
- the second era starts. Voidancitium started spreading around this verse way quicker.
17,692,300 OYC
- 10
100
OYC after formation
- normal-sized Post-Absolutes start slowly spreading at this verse.

OYC - ‚àû OYC after formation
- Post-Absolutes finish spreading around their
Post-Never
.
‚àû OYC - Œ© OYC after formation
- the original infinitesimall Post-Absolutes (also known as the first Post-Absolutes) have their life coming to an end, marking the first grand destruction within our
Post-Never
.
Inflation Era
[
]
Œ© OYC - ‚®Ä OYC existance
- inflation starts in this verse, making it grow slowly.
‚®Ä OYC - ‚ç∞ OYC existance
- inflation becomes, Post-Absolutes and Voidancitium are no longer fully spreaded around this verse.
‚ç∞ OYC -
œÅ
OYC existance
- inflation reaches it's maximum speed, though Post-Absolutes and Voidancitium are now somehow spreading faster than the inflation's maxium speed, meaning that eventually the spread will be complete soon.
œÅ
OYC - ‚´ù OYC existance
- inflation finally ends, and the spreading is at its maxium.
Present Era (N E V E R era)
[
]
Post-1 OYC - Post-‚àû OYC existance
- after the inflation ended, our
Post-Never
actually kept growing, but at a much slower (Post-Œ© Light-Years per 1 OYC) pace. For comparison, the inflation was at
p
light-years per 1 OYC on its prime.
Post-‚àû OYC - Post-N E V E R OYC existance
- growth seems to be turning faster once more. At present time, growth speed is a little faster than in the previous timestamp. The story still has not ended, and who knows if it ever will?
