Introduction
[
]
Rhoasm
or
ρasm
is the second
Hyperpolyasm
, the first one being
Orgasm
[
1
]
. To put it into perspective, comparing Rhoasm with Orgasm is like comparing
Earth
with
Looped Earth.
In fact, Rhoasm is basically a looped Orgasm! It's still not even close to reaching the Nigh-Ultimate tier in the
OCEH
, tho. It's also a destructive cosmic entity, filled with rage.
Story
[

Creation
[
]
This entity is technically the young brother of Orgasm. Several
OYC
after the apparition of Orgasm, its world was affected by a low level
Squidwarp
. The entity itself did nothing, dissapearing in less than a
voidsecond
. Tho, its mere existence in the area was already so mind-blowingly beyond both Orgasm and its world, it ended up distorting it. Orgasm almost died, and for some reason a small version of itself (The size of a
Yoctubial
) popped up. This creature was one of the most unstable things ever recorded, up to the point it teleported instantly after its creation, without Orgasm noticing it. This creature was half Hyperpolyasm and half Squidwarp's energy, thus making it unstable, since the major power difference bethween these two parts. It ended up imploding in itself, and turning into the size of a
Primition
and weaker than a
Bogdot
, but the reason it didnt die was because Squidwarp's energy refusing to do so.
Unending pain
[
]
This entire process was agonizing for Rhoasm, being OYCs trapped in this state in the most horrible of pains, even above the ones in
Beyond hell
. Since this entity got into this state before even forming anything else on his mind, so it only created more and more hatred for everything... being conscious, it wanted revenge. His Squidwarp energy made it know who was the responsible for its existence in the first place, but it couldn't do anything about it.

This was until
Phiminitianiakolominininiation
found it. Phimin tried to decompose it at first, but before that he noticed that this entity wasn't common at all. He noticed its Squidwarp's energy, and its desires for revenge. Phimin ended up deleting its agony and its hate towards the Squidwarps, but not his rage... Phim wanted to use Rhoasm as a toy, turning it into a being above Orgasm, then releasing it to destroy everything it finds. But soon, Rho's hatred for Squidwarps would return agaisnt all odds...
