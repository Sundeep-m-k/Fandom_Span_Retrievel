The
Nihilistic Galaxy
is the largest
galaxy
in its
universe
(not counting
NCV-9181E8
, which has radio jets of 33 million light years across),
UNI-5039
. Its diameter is disputed, as for some it's just a part of a spiral-like galactic megacluster, making it 6.2 million light years across, while others claim that the spiral is just one whole galaxy, making it 1.2 billion light years across. It is a part of the
Salastus Galactic Megacluster
, if the true size is 6.2 million light years, which contains roughly 2.3 billion galaxies.
Containing 290 quintillion
stars
, this galaxy is supermassive. It has a
quasar
at its center with a 66.06 trillion M
â˜‰
(solar masses)
black hole
. Using recent calculations from the year 2236,
individuals
have discovered the central black hole was around 2.0633097 light years wide. The Nihilistic Galaxy also has 2,016 satellite galaxies orbiting it. The galaxy is so large, that most of its inhabitants agree that the galaxy is the universe itself, and beyond that is just
void
. Everything here is just disputed.
Somehow,
Nihil
was its namesake.

Aw, man! Not again, it's a black hole!

Nihilistic Galaxy is one of the most powerful voids, because it is only 0.00001% matter, and the 'matter' is just letters. Fill in the void by
