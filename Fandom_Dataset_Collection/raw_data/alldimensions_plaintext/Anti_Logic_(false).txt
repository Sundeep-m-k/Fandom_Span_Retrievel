Anti Logic
is the name of an extremely small “particle”, if you could even call it that, and they're the absolute building blocks of everything, regardless of their existence rank.
It is entirely unknown if these things even exist, or if they're even nonexisting at all. As the true building blocks of reality, it explains why particles behave the way they do, in a way that us humans, and any
other being
for that matter, can't comprehend. They're so small, Anti Logics are nothing compared to
nothing
compared to
nothing
compared to- you get the drill.
It is possible there are even smaller, more… nonexistent things that even explain how an Anti Logic works, but we’ll never know until we see it

.
The image you see on the right is extremely unlikely to be accurate. This is because Anti Logics are so small and abstract to have a truly accurate image. The properties of these “particles” are also undetermined as well, but they have the ability to make everything have the properties it does right now. An exact measurement of size can’t be made to to the sheer smallness of an Anti Logic.
