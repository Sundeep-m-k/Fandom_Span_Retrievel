Custsf
ðŸš·custsf is a cosmic entity that doesn't allow things to cross in a
Ketabsoverse
called KB 79381. It is a bad Ketabsoverse and the only thing different in this Ketab is that something cannot leave or enter that Ketab because of ðŸš·custsf.
We don't know what the creature looks like, but
squares
have been knowing that creature exists. Squares think ðŸš·custsf looks like a KB-79381-Dimensional ring (for example, a hollow sphere is a 3D ring and a hollow circle is a 2D ring) and it is made from atoms the diameter of 5500 ly.
Naming
[
]
The name of ðŸš·custsf is a reference to
