The ALLSPHERE is a super-void! That means it is a very big and empty void, having only 0.00000000000001% of its volume taken up by matter, and the 'matter' in it is just a very small amount of words, or just a single template. Fill in the super-void by

The
Allsphere
The ALLSPHERE (not to be confused with the actual
Allsphere
) is a verse that is bigger than the
allsphere
. That's why it has capital letters. The inside of the ALLSPHERE is the background of this page.
The ALLSPHERE is so incomprehensible that it cannot be described any further.
For now..
LUA scientists are working around the clock to find out more about the ALLSPHERE, so keep an eye on it for more content....
Btw the template above is an unofficial description of what the ALLSPHERE might look like, but void is like the primary substance for things, like water is to fish.
