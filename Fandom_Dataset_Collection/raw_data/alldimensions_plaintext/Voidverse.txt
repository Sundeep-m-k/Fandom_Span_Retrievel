The
Voidverse
are ancient
universes
that have expanded to such large proportions that they basically entirely empty. In a Voidverse laws practically dont exist as there is no more matter for the laws to apply, so Voidverses basically are just
Cosmoskeletons
(LNB of 0,0,1).

Formation
[
]
If a
Universe
dies off via the Big Freeze/Heat Death then it will eventually become a voidverse if no interference happens.
Behavior
[
]
The spacetime continuum in a Voidverse means nothing anymore which can cause really weird stuff to happen. Near the border there are whats known as “still particles”, these are particles that have penetrated through the border and got stuck in the Voidverse because time is practically nonexistent. Gravity and Electromagnetism also does not exist here so if you had an atom inside the Voidverse the particles in them would float away from each other (they actually wont because theres no time).
Structures
[
]
believe it or not there are structures in a Voidverse even though they contain nothing. The only structures that exist here are called “Dark Structures”. Dark structures are a collection of still particles [10 light years apart on average] in the shape of a once cosmic structure.
Far Future
[
]
Voidverses after a long enough period of time can become one of these 3: A Metaversal Void, Psuedo-Multiverse, and Enclosed Area. A Metaversal Void is a void big enough to be recognized on the
Metaversal
Scale. A Psuedo-Multiverse forms when new big bangs start happening within the Voidverse which reignites the laws causing a chain reaction of
Universes
and smaller
Archverses
to Form. And an Enclosed Area is where matter and stuff seeps in the Voidverse enough that its laws seep in too. Eventually the Voidverse would be filled with matter because of this and all thats left is the border.
Others

Voidverses are very rare in young higher
Archverses
and there are only an estimated 10 Voidverses in our
Hyperverse
so Voidverses are not very well understood.
