Do you enjoy going through hell? - Supreme Witch, Calamitas
Supreme Witch, Calamitas is a cosmic entity. After inheriting nigh limitless magical power as a mere teenager, she was recruited into
Yharim
's army, where she served for nearly a decade. She reveled in the violence of it all, the endless dance of madness and death, allowing the Godkiller to wield her as a weapon in his endless war against the gods. But now that the fire inside her has died, all that remains are the smoldering embers of regret.
