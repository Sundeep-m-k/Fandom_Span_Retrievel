The Wikibox is a giant version of
The Box
that contains the
Wikiverse Lab
. Only extremely powerful entities like
Fathomed Gods
can exit the Wikibox at any time. The Wikibox is slightly unstable, so it won’t usually collapse on itself, but it can still happen.

This structure also seems to have an extremely warm forcefield (which gets up to 300F) around it, which is a very sad attempt to get people to stop going too far out because even less powerful gods can withstand much higher temperatures. There is said to be an absolute infinity amount of Wikiboxes in all of existence.
