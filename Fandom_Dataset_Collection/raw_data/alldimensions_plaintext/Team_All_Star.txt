The Necromongers during the Folded Cascade campaign.
In 20X2, K.A.M.I.T.R.O.N was standing at his spike at night. Then, his younger brother, K.A.M.I.T.R.O.N.EXE, appeared.
K.A.M.I.T.R.O.N.EXE.
The evil version of K.A.M.I.T.R.O.N (K.A.M.I.T.R.O.N's younger brother) had declared war with K.A.M.I.T.R.O.N, while starting their attacks within the cascade. Most of these attacks were countered and contained by the Folded Cascade's resident overdeities, known as the Hexagon Lords. However, the threat of the K.A.M.I.T.R.O.N.EXE remained, and the Hexagon Lords, realizing they would be caught in the crossfire if they didn't escape, disappeared for the rest of the battle.
Battle of the...everything.                  Â !?

K.A.M.I.T.R.O.N immediately responded by teleporting all innocent residents of the cascade to deal with the nemesis easier.  The only surviving document of such a devastating war describes as follows:
When K.A.M.I.T.R.O.N is going to save his creations from his younger brother, he might need a team with K.A.M.I.T.R.O.N (the biggest number of all numbers that are bigger than beyond infinity) of all heroes and villains (the villains do not want to be bad ever again, because they want to join them) from all around the whole entire K.A.M.I.T.R.O.N.
Yep. He won by the way, no further info for now.
