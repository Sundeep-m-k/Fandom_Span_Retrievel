"'Before' is the name given to everything before the
Primordialverse
even existed, and that was transfinite years ago. It is not even possible to have 0.00000000000000000000.... (infinity)...1 Planck times before the
Primordialverse
was created. But 'Before' still does exist, in a sense. You can't just have nothing before an event. There must be something, even if that answer is
Nothing
. 'Before' isn't made up of some physical material. 'Before' is not a physical thing, for it doesn't even exist. It also doesn't have any attributes, or properties, for those concepts appeared when the Primordialverse first appeared. Also, 'Before' isn't contained, or does it contain, since 'Before' isn't a 'thing', it's a concept. BUT.... didn't 'concepts' first originate when the Primordialverse first appeared? It gets very confusing now after I said that." ~ ICantEdit on March 15th
This whole "nothing before
Primordialverse
" concept only applies to our cosmos. Other cosmos in the
Cosmic Complex
are not affected. Also, the description of Before isn't counting the
Oldverse
, the true oldest verse in the cosmos.
