Structure
[
]
Nineteen can be classed as a semi-void due to the literal absence of any form of real material except for 19
Eighteens
floating around. These Eighteens are spread unimaginably far away from each other, and have never collided due to this.
Outside of Nineteen
[
]
Nineteen is the end of the Eleven Chain and the biggest number verse there can be. Due to the Number Chains being isolated from the rest of the hierarchy, Nineteen is not really contained by any verse. However, many copies of the Nineteen are contained inside hierarchy verses such as
The Orbiting
