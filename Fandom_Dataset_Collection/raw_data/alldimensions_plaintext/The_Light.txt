The Light
is a verse with a large amount of light and energy. In fact, there is so much energy that the majority of objects are vaporized when they enter. The heat is quite literally infinite, making this verse just as dangerous as
The Dark
. This verse is so filled with energy that it is the main source of energy in
The Box
.
The danger of this verse means that civilizations had to teleport past this verse.
Due to this verse being a large energy source, many structures were built around it, and many wars were fought over it. In fact, the energy from this verse has been used to create multiple superweapons and megastructures, making many civilizations more powerful.
