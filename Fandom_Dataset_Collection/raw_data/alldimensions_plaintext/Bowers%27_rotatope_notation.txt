Bowers' Rotatope Notation
is a notation created by
Jonathan Bowers
to represent
rotatopes
.
In the notation, a
line segment
is represented as
|
{\displaystyle |}
and an n-dimensional
hypersphere
is represented as
(
|
n
âˆ’
2
)
{\displaystyle ({ | }^{ n-2 })}
(for example, a
circle
is
(
)
{\displaystyle ()}
and a
glome
is
(
|
|
)
{\displaystyle (||)}
).
Two of these elements placed adjacent to each other represent the multiplication of the two
polytopes
.
Strings in rotatope notation have the interesting property that they are the same length as the
dimension
of the
rotatope
they represent; for example,
(
|
|
|
|
)
|
{\displaystyle (||||)|}
represents a
seven-dimensional
Hexaphere-Based Prism
, and is seven characters long.
Since there are only two states for the entries - a bracket or a line - strings in rototope notation can be stored using a maximum of one bit per
dimension
. An example encoding would be to have 0 for brackets and 1 for lines. This would make a
Hexaphere-Based Prism
representable using 0111101.
