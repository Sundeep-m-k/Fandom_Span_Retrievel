Ubrokeit

It can be reached by thinking about breaking a portal while using a portal. The portal will break. It is a fairly small verse and is made of glass, cracked glass, cracked cracked glass and beings made of glass. The beings are pretty cool, they supply somehow entirely edible foods made of glass. None of the glass can be melted, it can be broken but it has the same strength as the equivalent of it in the corresponding dimension to it. None of the glass is colored, so you can see the verse containing it
