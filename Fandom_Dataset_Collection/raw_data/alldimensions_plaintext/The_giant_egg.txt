The
giant egg
is a giant egg that floats around
The FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg
. This egg is magnetic on the inside, so all of its objects and egg white is on the inside of its eggshell. Therefore, The giant egg is mostly an empty void.
The objects
[
]
This egg contains many objects, but there isn't much of a variety. This is because the air in this egg is actually gas metal, and it can become cold to make metallic objects. These objects, since they are metallic, get pulled into the inside of the eggshell.
The eggshell
[
]
The reason the eggshell is magnetic is because the metallic molecules in the air get transferred into the eggshell. The eggshell can easily absorb them because it is only 7cm thick. Therefore, the eggshell is magnetic.
The void
[
]
The only things between the objects stuck to the eggshell and
The big egg
are air and non-metallic objects. While the eggshell affects most of the metallic objects and metallic air, some of the objects instead have their metallic molecules stripped off. These turn into regular objects and air, and no longer are stuck to the eggshell. This process is very rare, however, since molecules almost never get stripped off.
