The
Absolutely tiny Particles
are a chain of majorly scaled down
part
icles
in
Cla
ss 0
. Measuring scale, ATU (Absolutely Tiny Unit), is equal to
1
1000
{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1000}}}
Hekc
diameters
. In other words, size of particles start at straight down infinitesimal scale.
Also, ATSL (Absolutely Tiny Scale Level) is to differentiate some particles from their homonym
[

.

These atoms act like
Repulsive
matter
. They repel practically every single thing that gets close to it. That means no force can push it, and the Absolutely tiny atoms aren't affected by gravity, radiation, or any particle at all.

ATSL Subatomic Particles are various kinds of small and fragile particles forming from collapses of protoverses. They are little tiny dangerous specs of dust that sometimes
explode and dam
age nearby space
.

Absolutely tiny elementary particles can be at all three states:
qua
rks
[

]
,
lep
tons
[
6
]
, and
bos
ons
[
7
]
(All ATSL). If the particle comes in contact with a force, it collapses into one state among the three. This is because the particles are so
ti
ny
that normal, inter-versal wide forces can penetrate the particle, changing the vibration, which causes the particle to have multiple states at once.

ATSL strings are
WAY
more fragile than every single
Absolutely tiny elementary
particles
[
8
]
. They are raveled up in a skinny bundle in order to increase stability, but this does limit the string's vibration somewhat, reducing the number of possible particles. As a result of this, the only ATSL elementary particles are absolutely tiny electrons, up quarks, and down quarks.

ATSL Uqraek fiber is fiber so unfathomably small and unstable that it can not be tracked with any type of technology. Our
Univ
erse
made entirely of absolutely tiny ATSL Uqraek fiber would almost instantly go into a state of "explosion" due to instability and the number of collisions between objects so small. It is too small to contain actual -verses, unlike the
Uqraek
fiber

This is the "thing" that makes up
ATSL
Uqraek fiber
.
As it is so small, it is insanely unstable.
Atomic fabrics
[

do not have a naturally forming repulsive barrier. And due to its instability, it will violently explode into countless pieces of itself. Which can corrupt and destroy everything near it, even

if it came to contact with.

Information about Nonexistent particles is strictly impossible to know
[
10
]
. This is due to Nonexistent particles being strictly impossible to define, as much as its information. Like, how in the world is anything going to be able to represent "Nonexistent particle is a
part

that is
not a p

is a
cloud and not a cloud of property and is strictly
definable and undefinable, and it exists and does not exist

There are also a few particles even smaller than the ones describable with ATU, HATU, and AHATU. Particles of these sizes are near-building blocks of reality, reaching the lowest level of

Thingk is the only component for minuscule fabrics. Every fabric of reality
[
16
]
can be
broken down
into one component particle: the Thingk. These specks of dust
[

bind to each other and create every sort of fabric EVERY. Similar to
ATSL strings
, Thingk produces different fabrics by vibrating and arranging in various combinations.

Mandelsok (or mandelbrotstuffisok) is a container for various anomalies, along with countless
tiny particles
[
18

. It is also one of the most complicated particles. In fact, there are
so many
particles floating around inside Mandelsok, it almost looks like a normal verse (if one had the
ability to look "inside of mandelsok"

Well of course there are truly infinite uses for single word such as "atom" if search scale grows to insane scale...

Everything above Uqraek fiber is measured in ATU, and Uqraek fiber and below small objects are measured in HATU. And nonexistent particle is measured in AHATU.

Unlike the other ones, size of these particles are described much smaller functions than "ATU", "HATU", and "AHATU".

As expressed below, size of below particles are measured in this equation:

{\displaystyle Size=NPSS\times\frac{1}{n}}
, where
N

S
{\displaystyle NPSS}
(negative property size standard) is a size that has maximum negative properties, while still being in the
∅
range. This concept has its roots at how the size of
Zyoron
is described.
