Main Function
[
]
The CetaTravel Machine works like a roulette. If you activate it, it will send you to a random verse anywhere in our
Cetaverse
. But of course, you can turn this property off by turning the "Roulette Mode" off, aka deactivating it. You'll be able to use a search bar that appears upon disabling "Roulette Mode", which you can use to manually go to any verse (typing it out) in our cetaverse.
Radio
[
]
There is a radio attached to the top of the Main Part, it uses the Antenna to receive Radio signals that travel at the speed of 1 Metaverse per second.
Antenna
[

The Antenna is next to the Radio, it Picks up signals from either the selected verse or from a person from the Telephone, which is also attached to the Main Part.
