Distorial Cubes
are objects that contain every verse with the level of a
revived end
and below. The "distorial" status comes from being above any scripted story that is part of a revived end and, in fact, Distorial Cubes are able to rig certain properties of the revived ends within them so that the chances of their narratives being corrupted due to an internal failure or a manipulation from an entity / civilization decreases.
Certain revived ends can become so strong they can even gain control of their local Distorial Cube though, these being classified as "core revived ends" since they kinda act like a core of their local Distorial Cubes. Roughly 1 out of 9.3822192...1 Distorial Cubes has a core revived end within them, and if it gets destroyed then the Cube containing it may be at danger of being erased.
By the way, the "cube" status is given due to being... shaped like a cube. Yea thats it, did you really expect a deeper explanation?
