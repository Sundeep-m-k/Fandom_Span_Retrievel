Here at the Watching Yo-yo-Hope and Dandelion Council, we are committed to ensuring everything happens as normally as possible, however impossible that may be. We are always looking for ways to make everything less dangerous and increase safety and non-entropy as much as we can. This may entail damage, temporary stoppage to anything in particular, temporary continuation of anything in particular, noticeable or unnoticeable interference and death (deliberate or accidental).
