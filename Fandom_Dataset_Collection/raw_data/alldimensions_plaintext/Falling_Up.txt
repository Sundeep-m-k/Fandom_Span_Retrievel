Falling Down
Falling Up
is the opposite of
Falling Down
- it is a verse known to push things away from
Falling Down
, making
Falling Down
impossible to reach. This is why it is called
Falling Up
.
Emptiness
[
]
Everything bar
Falling Down
and the ones in it are empty. This verse is nothing but a force, which doesn't really exist, so the force is not being pushed away by force. Apparently, it is trying to make itself empty.
Falling Downs

]
The
Falling Downs
are affected in a strange way by the force. The force pulls them towards it but with half force, and once they are pulled to it they are moved in the opposite direction before falling up again.2
