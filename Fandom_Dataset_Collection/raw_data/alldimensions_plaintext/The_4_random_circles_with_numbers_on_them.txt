The 4 random circles with numbers on them (T4CN for short) are a set of 4 big circles in a square shape. They are labeled with numbers 1-4 and rest in a white lattice that is known as
background
. They also sometimes spawn an outline the goes out around 6x the size of the circle.
Activities
[
]
There are some activities in T4CN (like the outline circles) that happen around once every 0.4 OYC.
The outline
[
]
The outline of a circle appears when viewed ~1 OYC in the past to right before present time. But this only works for ~0.6 OYC periods, with it not working for ~0.4 OYC after. The cycle stops because the outline removes the circle for ~0.4 OYC before it reappears again.
