The Pre-Hierarchy/Class -2 Explanation is one of the most powerful voids, because it is only 0.00001% matter, and the 'matter' is just letters. Fill in the void by

.
This is a short summary/explanation of the particles currently in
Class -2
, as their properties (or lack thereof) can be hard to understand at first glance.

Abstraction

Mathon
[
]
Mathon
is a particle that holds the forces of mathematical objects. There is a subparticle holding the set of infinities,
Enfinity
.
-null-
[
]
-null-
is a property which is visualized as nothing physically, and seen as a null set abstractly.
Axions
[
]
The sequence of
Axions
clarify the thoughts of semi-abstract objects and basic concepts, varying on mathematics, type theory, and axioms. There is a special subparticle holding null type,
Nothing Axion
.
Nonat Particles
[
]
There are 2 significant kinds of Nonat Particles:
Nonons
are the first kind of Nonat Particles, which hold a special kind of null, isolating from definable abstract dimensions.
Metium
is the other kind, which holds alt-nulls; alternatively from null / zero as depictions of Nothing.

Nontubial
[
]
Nontubial
is a mathematical field that defines a distorted hypertube topology and signs for bijective predicates, as it is bent beyond spacetime due to infinitary subabstraction
Zeron
[
]
Zeron
is the abstractly smallest particle in Class -2. With abstraction of nullity, this holds the quantities of zero as truly signless in Nontubial's mathematical field of signs.
Nothing
[
]
Nothing
is the absence of anything. Despite the fact that there is nothing in, well, nothing, it is still conceptual, so any pre-conceptual particle is probably smaller than nothing. Of course a particle would be something, which is more than nothing...
Nothing may be imagined as a black void, but that isn't nothing since it is both a void and black, and nothing has no color, and it isn't even a void. But it's still kind of a void.
