∅,
aka the
null set
is a set of non-properly-known numbers which are between zero and negative numbers.
They're mostly used when describing the size/dimensionality/kardashev scale/etc. of early
class -1
verses
/
particles
/etc. from
the pre-hierarchy
. Using ∅ means the value is indefinitely below zero but still above the negatives, so several structures can have their values determined as ∅ without any further explanation. ∅ will remain the same thing even if something is n times smaller or bigger than ∅ object but the value still is ∅. It even has positive and negative properties, meaning that there are different levels of the null set (∅).
Comparing ∅ with a negative number is like comparing a positive number with zero.
