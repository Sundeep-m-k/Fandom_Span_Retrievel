Verseultras
are negative versions of
Ultraverses
, which are looped negative-dimensional kind of spacetime so that they serve a way to getting many different negative sizes. Every Verseultra has negative three dimensions.
The Verseultras seem to be very safe at times of cosmic dangers and are maintained and controlled by negative-sized entities such as
Scalenes
. The Verseultras originally had a lot of dangers that can destroy larger objects in the
Verseuni chain
due to being the exact opposite of Ultraverses.
