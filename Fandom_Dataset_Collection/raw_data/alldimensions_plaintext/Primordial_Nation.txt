The
Primordial Nations
are the final verse into which a civilization can progress. No civilization can be larger than one without splitting or destroying itself. The Primordial Cities within them are the only bastions of any type of anything.
Outside of them, the Primordial Nations slowly become more and more aggressive. 100
Primordial Baskets
away from a Primordial City, and anything above the size of a
Garage
will begin to be disassembled. After 200 Baskets,
Blueprint Particles
will lose their formation, and no higher verses or particles will be able to exist. At 276 baskets, one's
Axions
will be turned into multitudes of lower level Axions. At this point, one will probably not be able to traverse further. If one continues to go on, their extremely small particles will lose formation without exploding, and they will continue to become more and more disassembled.
Depending on the size of a Primordial City, it will have a radius between 0.5 and 12 times its size where the Primordial Nations begin to catastrophically rip themselves apart. Primordial Cities are strategically placed to prevent this from occurring, as it destroys the entire nations and everyone in them. Primordial cities are required for the existence of Primordial Nations.
Energy is constantly flowing out of the nations from inpouring matter not being fully deconstructed, and is used as a foundation for Primordial Cities using an altered form of photoelectric platforms.
