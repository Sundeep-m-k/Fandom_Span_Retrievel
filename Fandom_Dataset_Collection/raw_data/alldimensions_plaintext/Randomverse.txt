The Cosmic Barrier
Contains:
every
Ch04s
verse
This verse is completely random.
It can change dimensions randomly, change temperature randomly, change shape randomly, change size randomly,... etc.
The randomness this verse follows is true randomness. This verse doesn't spin and has no regular matter in it either. All the matter is dark matter,
Repulsive matter
, or antimatter. There is only one planet called Exteroips, and that planet contains every single
Ch04s
dimension possible. The growing and shrinking of the Randomverse doesn't affect Exteroips. Also, there is a suspicious-looking rock that seems to be man made.
The YellowMarkers Telescope
determined that there were
Elon Musks
in that ship.
