A
Temporal Paradox
is an event which occurs when a
Wormhole
or other same-timeline time travel method is used to perform an action that, in any way, prevents itself from happening.
The type of temporal paradox most multiversal physicists concern themselves with is often referred to as a
Grandfather Paradox
, named after a common example in which an aspiring time traveler kills their own grandfather, preventing themselves from being born (and, in addition, potentially removing any reason for the action), preventing the action from being performed. (Since the event could not have happened, the effect could not have resulted in the death of the traveler, thus allowing the event to happen, preventing the event from happening.)
It is uncertain what will happen in the event of a Temporal Paradox. The most likely result (according to research and speculation) is that the entire instance of the largest possible Archverse will enter a
BSoD
-esque vegetative state, of which any low-level lifeforms are completely unaware even after it concludes. Theoretically, the easiest way to resolve the effects of this event is to erase the time of the creation of the wormhole or other cause and all events after it (essentially, to cut off the timeline before the point where it loops on itself and discard the removed segment), which is theoretically impossible.
This has nothing to do with space but who cares
