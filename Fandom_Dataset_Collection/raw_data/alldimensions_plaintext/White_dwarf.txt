A
white dwarf
is a stellar remnant, left after a larger star dies, composed mainly of electron-degenerate matter (matter in which electrons being forced into high-energy states produces an outwards pressure). A typical white dwarf contains the mass of the Sun compressed into a volume the size of the Earth, with a density of around 10

. They make up approximately 5% of luminous stars.
The upper limit of the mass of white dwarf stars is given by the Chandrasekhar limit, and is equal to 1.39 solar masses. Some white dwarf stars can exceed this limit temporarily by rotating rapidly or merging with other white dwarfs; the SN 2003fg came from a white dwarf star of 2 solar masses.
The nearest white dwarf star to Earth is Sirius B, located 8.6 light years away in the Sirius System.
Spectral Classes
[
]
Within the spectral superclass of Class D, there are six white dwarf spectral classes, depending on which spectral lines are present in the atmosphere of the star.
Class DA stars
: H lines are present; no He I or metal lines
Class DC stars
: No spectral lines are present
Class DB stars
: He I lines are present; no H or metal lines
Class DO stars
: He II lines are present, possibly accompanied by H and metal lines
Class DZ stars
: Metal lines are present; no He I or H lines
Class DQ stars
: Carbon lines are present
