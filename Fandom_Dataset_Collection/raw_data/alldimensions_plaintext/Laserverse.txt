The Laserverse is a variant of an
Omniverse
with the difference being is that the Laserverses contained verses are
Lasers
. These verses contain
lasertagverses.
The Laserverses also contain 1-10
Lasercores
which illuminate the whole verse, be warned: the lasers can cut through absolutely anything (except
Primordium sigma
) so please don't go there unless you have a Primordium sigma suit
(gosh i hate that the name of the strongest thing EVER includes the word sigma, the gen alphas are gonna laugh at this materials nameÂ :(( )
The Laserverses size? it can range from 6 Omniverses in size to about 270 Omniverses!
Its relatively stable, because every Earth year, about 3-4 Lasers can fly out of the Laserverse
There are 2 Laser types in the Laserverse too:
Colored lasers - these lasers are completely normal and don't have anything wrong with them, the most common type of laser
White lasers - when two bright enough lasers collide, two white lasers have a chance to appear from the collision, otherwise a mini explosion happens
Life may appear here, but they're simple-minded Primordium sigma-coated primordifish.
