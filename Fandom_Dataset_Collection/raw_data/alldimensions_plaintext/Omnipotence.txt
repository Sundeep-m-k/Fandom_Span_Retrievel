Omnipotence
, in its literal definition,
is the ability to do absolutely anything without exception. And it’s true,
the definition still remains as such, but in many places, like the Suggsverse canon, one can find creatures and beings which are
“beyond omnipotence”
. It is made so by either twisting the definition of
omnipotence
or expanding on what
“anything”
truly means.
Many times, in the context of real life circumstances,
omnipotence
is used in divine ways to refer to deities that are capable of understanding and doing absolutely anything within the realm of logic.
God is unable to make a circular cube as there is no such thing as a circular cube
. This type of
omnipotence
is weak, as it is only
omnipotence
in our
human-centric framework
. In certain recreational cosmological cases,
omnipotence
means the ability to manipulate freely with anything and everything on scales of certain infinities.
There are no limits to how large infinities can get so it calls for more terms to refer to post-omnipotence
. In more technical and formal recreational cosmological models,
omnipotence
either refers to exactly what its literal definition means, or it is an umbrella term for types of
omnipotences
(nigh, normal, true,
author authority, transfictional author authority
, meta, ulti, absolute, practical, questionable, specialized)
. For terms not necessarily equivalent to the literal definition of
omnipotence
, people just make up their own subjective definitions or ranks / categories which group together entities and deities of similar capabilities (
TOCEH
).
