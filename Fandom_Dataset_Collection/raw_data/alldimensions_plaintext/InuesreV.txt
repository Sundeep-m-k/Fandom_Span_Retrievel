The
inuesreV
is a verse that contains many
It is the It is the earths again... again...s
and also contains a central supermassive
black hole
, although nothing orbits it.
inuesreVs are usually found attached to each other, and in the image taken of a inuesreV, there is a collection of 5 clustered together. They also do not have a well-defined barrier, with a near-smooth transition between It is the It is the earths again... again...s and the compressed pseudo-barrier of the strange things inside the itlumesreV.

Recently, the people again... again...s have been starting to escape their earths again... again... and going into interplanetary space again... again.... This may mean that they will soon escape into the itlumesreV.
