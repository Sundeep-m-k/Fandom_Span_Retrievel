The
Super Fruit Bowls
are very large bowls of Super fruits. These fruits tend to be EXTREMELY varied, and on occasions there have been Super Fruit Bowls with every single type of fruit in them, including tomatoes.
The bowl itself is usually made of Epsilon-Porcelain, a tougher version of Omega Porcelain found in
Bowls
, with similar properties. The largest difference is E-Porcelain is black.
Aside from that, the Super Fruit Bowl, when not a mega-mix, usually consists of only one type of super fruit. The most common is the Super Orange Fruit Bowl, but they are in the lead by a thin majority.
