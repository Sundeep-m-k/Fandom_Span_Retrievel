The
Nihilthematical
or
⧈
(or just NTML)is a Number Invented By
Nihil
to determine power above infinite allspheres and Nihilums only thing that transcends this is Nihil Himself, The
Crearion
or "jerald", and
Ultimatæum The Supremaus Aeternum
and Finally N'Zal⧈uxs The Very Embodiment of The Number)
⧈
1
:
this means you have power over infinite allspheres
⧈
2
: means you have power over infinite allspheres and infinite Nihilums
⧈
∞
{\displaystyle \infty}
: this means you completely transcend all finite Nihilthematicalions(entities that use this power system and are in a rank of a non-infinite finite number)
⧈
ε
0
{\displaystyle \varepsilon_0}
and other epsilons: this means you transcend all infinite Nihilthematicalions
⧈
ζ
0
{\displaystyle \zeta_0}
and other
ζ
{\displaystyle \zeta}
s: This means you Completely have Infinitely Infinite Power and Transcendence over all epsilon Nihilthematicalions
⧈
Γ
0
{\displaystyle \Gamma_{0}}
and other
Γ
{\displaystyle \Gamma}
s: you transcend all the Zeta Nihilthematicalions
⧈
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
(Absolute Infinity): This is A HUGE STEP, makes Gamma look like
−
∞
{\displaystyle  -\infty }
⧈
ש
: Comparing this to ⧈
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
is like comparing Micropeanut to the
