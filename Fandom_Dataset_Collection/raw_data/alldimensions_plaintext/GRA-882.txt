Formation
[
]
GRA-882 is theorized to be the first ever
Gravaverse
formed. It is thought to have decayed from a universe to a
Gravaverse
and started the “Grava Transformation,” which is a large event of Gravaverses being formed by the nanoseconds of you reading this. It is called GRA-882 because it was the 882nd Gravaverse to be discovered by
Humanity
.
Civilizations?
[
]
Well, most gravaverses are about 273°C, but this one has warmed up to have about 2000 civilizations, because
Gravastars
can have planets. It is not the gravastars getting warmer, it is the area getting warmer overall.
Ararui
[
]
The Ararui are the first notable civilization to exist. Residing in the central regions of GRA-882, it has been classified as type 0.5 on the kardashev scale.
The Ararui do not seem like their technology is that good, but it is the same as about 1900s technology.
