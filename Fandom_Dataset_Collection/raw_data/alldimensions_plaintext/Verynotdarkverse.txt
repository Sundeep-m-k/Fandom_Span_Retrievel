The
Verynotdarkverse
is a verse created using
The Ripoff
from the
Lightverse
by an unknown entity/entities for an unknown purpose. It very closely resembles the
Lightverse
, though there are some very, very, very minor differences if you look closely enough, though it is, for almost all intents and purposes, the Lightverse.

Discovery
[
]
The Verydarkverse was first spotted nearby the
Lightverse
, when some entities going on a vacation to a different
Multiverse
went by the Lightverse and the Verydarkverse. They went to tell a nearby
Multiversal
-level cosmic entity, who turned out to be acquainted with the area. They found it very strange, and decided to tell a team of versologists, who were also puzzled.
Further investigation
[
]
After the team of versologists were told about the Verydarkverse, they decided to see what it had in store.
The exploration consisted of taking a look around the verse. Comparisons to the
Lightverse
were made, and it was discovered that they were almost identical.
After the exploration of the Verydarkverse was finished, an entity noticed a piece of paper on the barrier of the verse.
The text on it is as follows:
This verse has served
its purpose
, and we do not need it anymore. You may have it. Also, thanks for your
kind donation
to our cause! Make sure to give more next time.

Due to the signature, some entities have theorized a possible connection to the
