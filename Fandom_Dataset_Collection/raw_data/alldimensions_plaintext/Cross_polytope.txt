In
geometry
, a
cross-polytope
,
orthoplex
,
hyperoctahedron
or
cocube
is a
regular
, convex
polytope
that exists in
n
-
dimensions
. A 2-orthoplex is a square, a 3-orthoplex is a regular
octahedron
, and a 4-orthoplex is a 16-cell. Its facets are
simplexes
of the previous dimension, while the cross-polytope's vertex figure is another cross-polytope from the previous dimension.
The vertices of a cross-polytope are all the permutations of (±1, 0, 0, …, 0). The cross-polytope is the convex hull of its vertices. The
n
-dimensional cross-polytope can also be defined as the closed unit ball (or, according to some authors, its boundary) in the ℓ1-norm on
R
n

In 1 dimension the cross-polytope is simply the
line segment
[−1, +1], in 2 dimensions it is a
square
(or diamond) with vertices {(±1, 0), (0, ±1)}. In 3 dimensions it is an
octahedron
—one of the five convex regular polyhedra known as the Platonic solids. Higher-dimensional cross-polytopes are generalizations of these.
The cross-polytope is the dual polytope of the
hypercube
. The 1-skeleton of a
n
-dimensional cross-polytope is a Turán graph
T
(2
