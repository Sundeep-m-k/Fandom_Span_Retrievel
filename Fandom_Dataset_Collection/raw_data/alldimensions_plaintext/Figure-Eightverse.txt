The
Figure-Eightverse
is a verse that is shaped like a
figure-eight knot
. It is constructed from
Trefoilverses
.
All Figure-Eightverses are the same size, and they are closely packed together, causing them to form very strong bonds.
Occurrences in Figure-Eightverse
[
]
There are a couple of things that can happen inside a Figure-Eightverse, mainly Trefoilverses colliding, creating another Figure-Eightverse and destroying the previous one.
Sometimes two Figure-Eightverses collide if they are propelled fast enough, causing many Trefoilverses to collide and make many Figure-Eightverses. This is sometimes called
figurative reproduction
, although for something like that, it's not used much anymore due to thinking that it was related to the actual word 'figurative', although it's not.
