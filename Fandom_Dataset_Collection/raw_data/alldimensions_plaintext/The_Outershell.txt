The Outershell
is a region of The Outside, ranging around the 50,000 omniversal radii mark, where primordial Cubes have gathered to form a kind of larger omniversal space surrounding the actual omniverse. Despite being of 0 depth, it still contains infinite dimensions in which to hold all sorts of verses. Verses do not naturally form in this region usually, however, artificial verses are constructed here to serve as transit stations between The Omniverse and the larger existence known as The Box.
In addition, there are secret research and development facilities that often act as waypoints to extremely secret locations between The Omniverse and The Outershell. The best known of these secret locations is The Xicohtlxul, which is communicated with to provide virtually infinite computational power to various experimental investigations in mathematics and science.
The Outershell forms an infinite radius Hilbert Sphere (an infinite dimensional sphere). There is so much room here in fact that most of it is completely unoccupied, even though the traffic of the entire omniverse passes through it. The point where all the traffic is focused, is Known as
The Focus
.
Outside The Focus, are an unknown number of top secret facilities. Lastly there is an even larger unknown number of rogue void civilizations that isolate themselves completely from The Omniverse. It's impossible to know about or get to these places without already knowing their precise coordinates, thus they are kept safe from random intrusion. The infinite space of The Outside provides this natural safety, and the same can be said of the infinite space of The Outershell, itself just as large as The Omniverse.
