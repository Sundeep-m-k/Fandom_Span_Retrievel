Structure
[
]
Choif has a very strange structure. The majority of it is very flat, with occasional mountain ranges. The tallest mountain on Choif is a mountain known as Mount Everest (not to be confused with the mountain with the same name located on
Earth
).
Choif only has one ocean. This ocean contains the Mariana Trench. There is a trench beneath the Mariana Trench, known as the Marinara Trench, and another trench below that, called the Anairam trench. These nested layers of trenches go on for an unknown distance.
Another strange area of Choif is a sea of cars (commonly abbreviated as SOC). Many theories have popped up saying that this sea of cars is where the unnatural amount of cars in Choif come from. It is unknown if this sea of cars is related to the nested Trenches. As of now, the sea of cars has been destroyed and its destruction has left a massive hole in Choif.
After Part Nine of the series, Choif is now covered in an ocean of blood that completely engulfed the SOC hole the nested trenches, and everything else except for Mount Everest.
Jack
[
]
The main focus of the Mt. Everest stories is Jack, the protagonist of them. Jack has a strange obsession with trying to climb the tallest mountain on Choif, Mt. Everest and reach the top of it.
Jack as of now
Jack is very strange in the fact that he seems to be immortal (as evidenced in Part 1), when he dies, falls off Mt. Everest (presumably not the real one), and somehow becomes alive again in the next part. He also has knowledge of things he really shouldn't, and knows about games such as Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite (albeit with a misspelling of the name). He also knows about things such as Fuzzo's Cosmology Wiki, abbreviating it as 'FCW', and says that he "got banned from it" in the 4th part.
As of now, Jack has hold of the
Ap-Klon Rocket Launcher
, a powerful rocket launcher.
Personality
[
]
Jack has a very strange personality similar to someone with a mental disorder. He has become famous due to his unexplained allergy to cars and his frequent habit of using nonsensical reasons to justify/explain his actions (for example, "The car exploded again since I swim in Coca Cola"). Jack seems to have a love-hate relationship with dinosaurs, and will also frequently say "because that's how mafia works" after stealing a car.
Other Lifeforms on Choif
[
]
Choif is home to an unknown number of lifeforms.
Purple Face/The Man Behind The Slaughter/TMBTS
[
]
It is known that an entity known as "Purple Face" resides in an parallel version of Choif, in which Jack traveled to through unknown means. Purple Face also goes by The Man Behind The Slaughter or TMBTS. Purple Face does not seem to be able to speak normally, and will only talk in strange, gibberish sounds. It is unknown if other entities on Choif understand what Purple Face is saying.
Idiot
[
]
An example of life on Choif is a strange entity whose appearance resembles the space bar of a keyboard. Its personality is very mysterious, and has been seen to fall into the hole created upon the SOC's destruction and the nested trenches many times. In Chapter 6, after Jack followed Idiot down the SOC's hole, Idiot has become very hostile and fought Jack in Chapter 7/8, with Jack coming out victorious(?), although Idiot quickly reappeared in Part Nine and Part Ten (it is not known what happened to Idiot after they plunged in the blood ocean at the end of Part Ten).
Noteworthy Objects on Choif
[
]
The Ap-Klon Rocket Launcher
[
]
The Ap-Klon Rocket Launcher (abbreviated to just AK) is a rocket launcher which Jack somehow barfed out. This rocket launcher is extremely powerful, and can potentially vaporize a target if fired at a close enough range. The AK was added to in Part 7/Part 8, when Jack threw many metal scraps at Idiot during their battle, with Idiot picking them up and stuffing them inside the AK. This has made the AK much stronger.
Trivia
[
]
"Ap-klon" used to mean "do not touch" in
The Pencil Language
, although the language was changed and now it doesn't mean anything in particular..
The AK seems to be able to auto-fire, and does not need to be reloaded after every shot or two, like most other such weapons.
