They can sometimes immediately dissapear. The chance of them doing this is about 1/googolplexian per second at first, but over time this becomes more common. Here is how fast it goes:
after 1 minute, it’s already 1/googolplex per second.
after 1 hour, it’s 1/googol per second.
it’s only 1/1 quintillion per second after 3 days.
The chance of it happening is 1/1,000 after 2 weeks.
It happens with a 1/10 chance every second after 10 weeks.
It will almost always happen immediately after 1 year.
