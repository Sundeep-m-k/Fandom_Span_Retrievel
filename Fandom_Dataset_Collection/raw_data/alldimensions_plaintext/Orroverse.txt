The
Orroverse
is a universal parasite that looks for a
Universe
to inject its genetic code into them, similar to a virus. After the Orroverse has injected its genetic code into the host universe, the injected code inside the universe begins to eat the heaviest elements first, then the lightest elements last. Orroverses can also compress in size to form heavier elements. They can also do this in reverse.
Outer Layer
[
]
The outer layer of the Orroverse has a rough, sticky layer that traps any kind of matter, then the matter is taken inside of the Orroverse to be translated into genetic code. The rough layers also are able to penatrate a
Universe
, so the Orroverse can inject the genetic code.
Inner Layer
[
]
The inner layer is a place where all the Mega Atoms are genarated. The Orroverse uses the Mega Atoms to create DNA strands the size of galaxies. Along with Mega Atoms, the inner layer has very dense gas that weighs 51,036 kg/m

, negative-mass matter, rapidly changing colors, and atoms randomly teleported throughout the inner layer.
Core
[
]
The core is a place full of weirdness and chaotic stuff. There is only chaos in the core, because the atoms here randomly grow and shrink, matter explodes all the time, time slows and speeds up, objects can go at infinite speed, and there are an infinite amount of dimentions.
