Things fried in The Pan
[
]
The Fried Egg is fried routinely by That Human every
megaday
. A megaday is basically 10
OYC
. The Pan can reach ridiculous temperatures that sometimes go over 1000e+100000 googolplex degrees. That makes living on The Pan virtually impossible.
Other than The Fried Egg, there is also fried bacon. This bacon is shrouded in mystery, and it is unknown what creatures live inside it.
Materials
[
]
The Pan is made out of an extremely tough and durable material that can withstand extreme temperatures. The color of The Pan itself is black. Most likely the reason is to conduct as much heat as possible to make The Fried Egg and The Fried Bacon extremely crispy. The Pan can also withstand all types of acid.
Attempts to destroy The Pan
[
]
The Seeker
has destroyed The Pan before, avoided
That Human
, and destroyed The Pan again after That Human repaired it. That Human, due to it being much weaker than The Seeker, cannot really do anything about this, and has tried to hide The Pan from The Seeker before, but to no avail.
