This place is so full of Xeno rings that it has covered its entirety and its color is unknown, there is no end here
Even if something escapes from here, we do not know what will happen to it, and the most common thing people say is that it will drift downward, and there is a black hole in the middle of this verse, but you cannot approach it no matter how hard you try, and you will not approach it even 1 xeno meter, and this black hole if you try. Imagine it will turn into a black hole the size of this verse, literally it will disappear when it becomes this size and it will gradually turn into a final absolute Xeno being!
