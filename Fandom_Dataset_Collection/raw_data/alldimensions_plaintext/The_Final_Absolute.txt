The
Final Absolute
is a mishmash of of differing sub-structure shapes containing Absolute Isocahedrons, and it's pretty much held together by spit, good will, and a bit of gravity. Its various spaces and places act almost like their own verses, but are considered a single location due to the density.
Substructures
[
]
Taking slight inspiration from the Absolute Relativity, The Final Absolute has differing sub-structure types for each of its regions, however they aren't going from out to center like layers, more like provinces of a small nation in how the regions are split.
Regions
[
]
Region 1: Alkugi. This regions is very filled with different substructures used to contain other bodies, while very dense with basic shapes there is a large shape about 1000x as large s the others in the middle of Alkugi
Region 2: Likona is a much more sparse and wacky region, being the only place to contain planets and stars in this verse as well as having half the usual shape substructures. This is also the only place that has technology able to travel through regions of a Final Absolute.
Region 3: Yunija. Yunija is the more boring region in the middle, not having anything notable except for the core of The Final Absolute, which holds the only nonacontanonagon. The density of substructures is very average as well.
Region 4: Piliku. Piliku is the smallest region by a small margin, and hold very hot metals within its areas. These metals often crash into its substructures, making life in one of those very difficult and overall nasty.
