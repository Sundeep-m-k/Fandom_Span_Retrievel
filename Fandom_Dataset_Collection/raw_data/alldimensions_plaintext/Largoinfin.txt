Largoinfin is a massive cosmic entity resembling a massive fish with 1 fin and no tail.
Largoinfin moves very slowly, and will swish its fin at attackers to destroy them. Largoinfin's fin is one of the strongest natural weapons, and it can puncture a hole in even
The Box
with ease.
Largoinfin will sometimes consume nearby verses, as it eats verses for food. Largoinfin will at times consume up to 8 verses per
OYC
, although it usually consumes less as it is not able to move fast and because the space it resides in does not have many verses.
The verses that Largoinfin consumes are almost always completely destroyed. Only one verse is known to remain intact inside Largoinfin, the Qiqiqiqiqiverse.
Largoinfin has a giant eye located at its front. This eye can see very far, and can "lock onto" verses and drag them to where Largoinfin is at for it to consume.
