An
apocalypse
is an event that can occur within a
Universe
,
Multiverse
,
Omniverse
, or any verse contained within any of those. These tend to have multiple levels, and also usually result in the death of a verse, so people do the best they can to prevent them. If they do occur, there is still hope. Sometimes, the verse makes it out alive.

Zombie Apocalypse
[
]
The first thing most people think of when they here
apocalypse
, so it
has
to be here
somewhere
. zombie parasite.
Level 1
[
]
This is when the zombie apocalypse is starting. Somebody gets the parasite on them and infects others fast, but doesn’t have much effect beyond a galaxy or verse, so can be ‘contained’ without
too
much
trouble. If it continues, well...
Level 2
[
]
The second stage. The zombie apocalypse reaches out beyond and is a verdemic, which is a pandemic throughout all of a verse. The zombies start to convert strong gods, such as ones with similar power to, say, uh... I don’t have any good examples.
Level 3
[
]
There are only a few people left, and the apocalypse has surely taken the verse. The remaining residents migrate to nearby verses just to stay alive. Just make sure you don’t bring any zombies with you... if you do, it’s best to destroy your space method and kill both you and the zombies. It’s more helpful to others. Be thoughtful.
Ruined Apocalypse
[
]
When society is in some desert ruins and few people remain, and everyone eventually inevitably dies.
Level 1
[
]
Society collapses, structures collapse, the sky is dark, and fire ravages cities. The classic disaster. People run and panic in attempt to find a nonexistent way to escape from the eternal destruction of their beloved homes and loved ones.
Level 2
[
]
Rain, lightning, ruined homes everywhere, people begin accepting their fate and crying. A giant black cyclone is in the sky and everything has both a gloomy and bloodthirsy look on it. That’s it. The end. No recovery from this point forwards. It’s possible, but it actually isn’t.
Level 3
[
]
99% collapsed and missing desert ruins with ancient ruined nothingness. That was worded badly. Anyways, no food or water, society quickly dies out. That would be the true end for a verse. One of the hardest apocalypses to end and rebuild society in. All hope is at this point... lost forever.
Frozen Apocalypse
[
]
The verse freezes and becomes a giant chunk of ice and irrecoverable. Melt it and the verse is gone. Break it and the verse breaks. Let it thaw and it never will, but it will still mean the verse is gone. The end.
Level 1
[
]
It begins to get cold, however contact is still there. Tempuratures on Earth reach below 0 farenhieght regularly. People still have hope, and there still is hope. If only all this would melt...
Level 2
[
]
Fog covers the interior of the verse, it is impossible to see further than a few feet in the constant blizzard. People and cars are entirely ice chunks, and from here on out all hope of revovery is destroyed as the verse is devastated by the sheer cold.
Level 3
[
]
Ice... it reaches the entire verse. It’s a giant absolute zero ice chunk now. It cannot be brought back. RIP. This is the only level of any apocalypse where it is
TRULY
impossible for the poor verse to return. I feel sad typing this sad truth.
