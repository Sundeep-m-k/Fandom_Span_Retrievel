Threads
The
Spool
contains a huge amount of
Threads
, or timelines. It has the ability to
ｄｉｓｃａｒｄ
a Thread if a catastropic, time-ending event occurs there. Threads are layered onto it and each layer represents different “types“ of Threads. The first layer is new Threads where not much has happened. The second layer is Threads that are a bit older. The third layer is quite old Threads that are starting to show tiny signs of damage (ours is here!). The final layer is extremely damaged Threads that are soon to be discarded if not repaired by Chunky . Also, one time
Avi
and
Delimangur
tried to mess with time by ripping Threads off The Spool, but Avi was totally vaporized due to getting to the wrong Thread and Delimangur was brutally injured by
Chunky Cheese
