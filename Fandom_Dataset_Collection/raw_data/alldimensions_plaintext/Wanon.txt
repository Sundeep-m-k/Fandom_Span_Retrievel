Species
Primordial Entity
Wanon
, one of
the Brothers
united against
the Primordial
, is a rather timid
cosmic entity
who was created to symbolize WAR and NEGATIVITY, but ended up being much more peaceful then first thought, even compared to
Waxon
, and ended up going for intellectual pursuits and attempting to help out his brother retake the Primordialverse. Even though he's very calm, he is just as revenge driven as Waxon and formulates various plans to defeat, as they call him, "The Oppressor of Existence," alias the Primordial. He usually hides in Waxon's shadow for better or for worse, and he's very content with being the background director of Waxon's play. He once wished to destroy most life on planets and cause more aggression between the remainders, but decided that his brother's goals were more reasonable and well-meant. He still wishes for some adjustments, but that can be taken care of whenever they get to ruling existence, right?
