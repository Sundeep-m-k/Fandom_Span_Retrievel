Structure, Dimensions, and the other stuff
[
]
The structure of Glitch Space is extremely weird. The entire verse can randomly change, and it can sometimes change again in less than a planck time. There are voids that aren't affected though. Also, the dimensions in Glitch Space are supposed to be utterly impossible, yet they still occur. The dimensions can be more than the "biggest"
Inaccessible Cardinal
and -0D as well. The temperature is also impossible. Still, there is still life. The
Defiled Universe
floats around in the Glitch Space.
Life
[
]
The life in the Glitch Space is thought to have complete control over and have power to manipulate the Defiled Universe. However, no creature outside of the Defiled Universe has contacted the creatures yet, so we have no idea if this claim is true or not. one thing that is certain though, is that there are only 101 of these creatures in the Glitch Space.
Appearance
[
]
The appearance of the Glitch Space is quite unknown. One omnipotent creature said it was a mess of colors with swirling masses of voids, realities, and verses. The picture above is the depiction of Glitch Space the omnipotent creature created to describe it.
Strange stuff
[
]
There is also another
Glitch Space
known as "The Glitch Space" that partially merged with this Glitch Space during a high speed collision. This caused the Defiled Universes to move into the other Glitch Space. Also, Glitch Space and The Glitch Space are both contained by
The Glitch Hyperspace
. Still,
The Glitch Space
contains Glitch Space. Confusing, right?
