The
Fractionalverse
is an isolated verse that sustains life called Fraction Heads and each contains a copy of itself half the size of the larger fractionalverse. The 1st level is the size of
The Rock
and the size of each fractionalverse is calculated with a variable called "level" which points toward the layer number of that fractionalverse. How to calculate:
exponment = level - 1
fraction = 2 ^ exponment
size = The Rock / fraction
Fraction Heads have made entire civilizations within their fractionalverses.
