The chungusverse is a very large verse containing all chungi and chungus related objects. Its size is
Chungus Extent-Nonscriptable Level
. It is ruled over by the chungus council, and it has a very long overcomplicated history for no reason other than to have something remotely unique about these nonscriptable verses.Modern chungusverse is based entirely on hierarchy, wherein all chungi are placed in ranks and have other chungi to obey (upper classes) and lower chungi to command. The lowest class is composed of all non-chungi, who are completely subjugated and forced to live under chungus rule. It is legal for any chungus to harm non-chungi in any way for any reason. The chungusverse is also extremely militaristic, and routinely dismantles other verses, assimilating them into the chungosphere.

Most chungi inhabitants of the chungusverse are part of a hivemind and can directly communicate and transfer information between other members of the chungus hivemind.
chungus council
[
]
The chungus council consists of 11 members. From least op to most op, they are: Smallest chungus official, Micro chungus official, Small chungus official, big chungus official, biggest chungus / fat chungus... official, grassball chungus, cuck chungus official, gazonger chungus, THE chungus unofficial, Co-leader chungus semi-official, and Supreme truly nonscriptable leader ultimate head kraterocratic absolute monarch mega giga tera prefix ruler supreme dictative adjective super senatorial superlative first class superior grand great grahal blasphemorgual chungus 9000 v2 M561 Mk.IIIbot9001. It was formed at the beginning of the chungusverse, and is an absolute monarchy (with the only exception being Supreme truly nonscriptable leader ultimate head kraterocratic absolute monarch mega giga tera prefix ruler supreme dictative adjective super senatorial superlative first class superior grand great grahal blasphemorgual chungus 9000 v2 M561 Mk.IIIbot9001, hail Supreme truly nonscriptable leader ultimate head kraterocratic absolute monarch mega giga tera prefix ruler supreme dictative adjective super senatorial superlative first class superior grand great grahal blasphemorgual chungus 9000 v2 M561 Mk.IIIbot9001, He is eternal!) wherein once a member chungus resigns, a descendant chungus will take their place picked by either Supreme truly nonscriptable leader ultimate head kraterocratic absolute monarch mega giga tera prefix ruler supreme dictative adjective super senatorial superlative first class superior grand great grahal blasphemorgual chungus 9000 v2 M561 Mk.IIIbot9001 or the resigning chungus.

history of chungusverse
[
]
pee era
[
]
at first the chungusverse was just a collection of many disconnected small particles but it was eventually assembled into le old chungusverse by the first chungus. then the pastry wars caused the chungusverse to be divided, and divided among many factions who destroyed most of le old chungusverse. it got taken over by pastryslavia for 8127312371264615721657126572165712657216572165215, which attacked itself and an hero'd a while after. this meant the chungusverse was completely devoid of entities, but then the chungi all moved to le old chungusverse and stayed there. this is when it became the chungusverse again. they produced and eventually it got reformed repeatedly until it disappeared and had to be rebuilt by things that arent chungi (we dont know what they are)
le middle ages of le chungusverse
[
]
the unknown things that arent chungi departed about 16 after, and the chungi formed again to recolonize the chungusverse. they were too split on everything and constantly caused infighting, so chungusverse was a lot of chungusverses because shit was cray at the vro moment. the chungi got attacked by aliens or something and then united after, forming new chungiverse. new chungiverse collapsed because of bullshit that doesnt matter and some conspiracies, so it went back to endless infighting.
peach time
[
]
peach time happened so the chungusverse quickly reunited and became the new chungusverse. then the council formed and hivemind shits happened and it became giga 1984 and thats where the chungusverse is now.
fact
[
]
the chungusverse causes a huge split in the OCT (it is another common container of everything below chungus nonscriptable level). this means the next common container will actually be really big and stuff
other fact is the average chungus >
The Actual Biggest.
