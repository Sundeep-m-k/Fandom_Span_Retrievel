Contained by:
The Super Containers
, said to contain ‘some cool stuff’.
Contains:
Everything below itself, largest thing being the
Obsidianite Cetaverse
or if you want to skip that chain then the
Primordial Universes
.
The
Container
is an absolutely enormous structure that has a special quality that determines its name: It contains literally EVERY object that is smaller than itself, (that is, almost all
Class 21
's and below). The one exception to this are objects that are contained in the
Super Container
solely, which are few and far between, and other containers in the
Super Container
. This makes only 6.98×10
-16
% of the mass of the Super Container that is
not
contained by a Container.
While to beings smaller than it, the Container appears opaque, but in fact it is see-through to beings larger then
TSC
. For civilisations that are able to escape other
Class 21
bodies, escaping the Container is actually trivial. Poking a hole in one, is much harder, and will actually dissolve the entire container, like shattering glass or a balloon popping. Only beings larger than the
TSC
can do this. However, maybe an extremely dedicated Post-
TSC
might be able to do this, but this is unlikely, as it requires tremendous force.
Due to the container containing every
Class 21 and below
object at least once (probably an understatement, it contains immesurable amounts of each), it is one of the verses with the biggest
EUSI
. Yet another reason why I will not count it all out. The container is seen by all sub-TSC beings to be black, despite not actually having color. The cause of this is not yet known.
