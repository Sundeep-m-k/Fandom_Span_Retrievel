ProtoSystem
Protoland is a planet similar in composition to
Earth
. Unlike Earth however, it contains vast amounts of
Protos
.
Due to the excess amount of Protos, Protoland is very secure as all the Protos work together to prevent any corruption or bad things which happen to Protoland.
Protoland's most basic building blocks are, just like most other things, a protoverse. These Protoverses contain an insane amount of Protos, up to over
10
100
{\displaystyle 10^{100}}
of them.
