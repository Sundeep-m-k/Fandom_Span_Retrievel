Introduction
[
]
What if all your world was just part of another one, of another one, of another one, of another one, and etc.?
Final fractalism
/
Eternal fractalism
is the answer.
All that exists are somehow inside Final fractalism, from the smallest to the biggest. If something does contain Final Fractalism, it means this is ALSO another section of Final Fractalism. Other sections of Final Fractalism may have other names, but all of them are still it. Theres no such a Final-fractalismversal level entity or verse, because it would end up contradicting the Final Fractalism's endless path. F.F is also above hierarchies. But, there are the "Heart" shaped fractals, that can be destroyed. Ironically, Final fractalism isnt even 100% a fractal.
It has all existant, nonexistant and any other type of dimensionalities at once, while being the most stable 'verse ever, this being another Final Fractalism's rules. It is so big in fact, even when new "biggest" numbers are found it is discovered Final Fractalism beats them in size (example: it originally was thought to be
🌌
LY big, now its known that it is above
🐉
LY).
What are inside the heart shaped fractals?
[
]
These are very weird parts that are a mix of
Le jorino areas
and
verses
.
One of the rules of the final fractalism is that most of these areas are black, but they can change in color.

Lore
[
]
Final Fractalism really does not have an interesting lore for itself. It just exists before anything else, and has created everything else.
The controversy (extra)
[
]
A conflict that in human time lasted from february 18th, 2024 to march 29th of the same year happened, consisting that the mightyness of Final fractalism was disputed by another
verse
due to a
confusion
(full post context is recommended)
, ending with said verse being nerfed to the
23rd class
and Final fractalism still remaining as the largest structure ever until february 4, 2025.

Totum
eventually was found, so Final Fractalism stopped being the largest. Bruh.

Trivia
[
]
Final fractalism remained as the mightiest structure found for over 2 human years (since may 20, 2022) up to february 4, 2025, when Totum was found.
Even before Totum's discovery the
Allsphere
was found, but back then it wasn’t confirmed it was larger.
