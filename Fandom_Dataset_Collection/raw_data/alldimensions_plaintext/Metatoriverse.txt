The Metatoriverse is the first verse in the
Möbiverse hyperchain
that actually contains itself, like
The Box
. It contains an infinite amount of all previous -verses in the Möbiverse hyperchain, including
moquarks
and
Toriverses
.
Shape
[
]
Metatoriverses have an edge made of many, many Möbiverses chained together, however the Möbiverses are so small in comparison that they seem completely invisible.
The Metatoriverse is shaped like a Toriverse, or a torus.
Properties
[
]
In Metatoriverses, different areas have different temperatures, being the warmest when near another Metatoriverse. This is because Metatoriverses are so much larger than other verses, and therefore collisions are most prominent there, causing effects similar to
forustars
to happen.
