Final Universe
frees its
Caneverns
of an arbitrary limitation allowing for more variations of it. These variations come in may different types, each variation of Caneverns is known as a Final Star, and they glow in different colors depending on how much information reaches their edges, this is entirely dependent on the time and all of their phases are temporary, usually only lasting about TREE(17)
OYC
.
Any civilization that manages to become a noticable presence in Final Universe is almost garunteed to gain the
Absolute Controller
status wihin a few measures of time, no civilization so far has become a noticable presence here though. Final Universe has a being in it with the capability to change the state of Final Stars in about 1 OYC, but surprisingly, nobody has asked them who they are. Final universe is devoid of any arbitrary limitations on its
being
for it is not truly an object, it is a collection of Caneverns.
