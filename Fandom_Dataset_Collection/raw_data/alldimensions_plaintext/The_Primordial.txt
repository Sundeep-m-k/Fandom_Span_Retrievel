The Primorial
About
[
]
The
Primordial
(or '
Bood-Jav-Vav
' in
Puffish
) is the essence of the
Primordialverse
, its 'soul', if you will. This divine
God
of "Everything" is the
creator
of
THE 8 DIVINE GODS
, which each are the embodiment of a key aspect of reality: LIGHT, DARK, CREATION, DESTRUCTION, CHAOS, ORDER, SIGHT, and JUDGEMENT.
Purely made of "
Primordium Delta
", the most potent, powerful and strong substance that can or could exist in the cosmos, he has total control over the
Primordialverse
, and can see everything from every possible and impossible timeline, so he basically just sees the entirety of, for example, a
Box
as his vision for all eternity.
He also is the origin of the species known as 'Primordial Entities', as he was the first one of that type to be discovered. This is due to him being the closest in proximity to most civilizations, as not many mortal level life beings exist outside
the Erasers
, and the
Omniverses
are one of the main three types of realities orbiting a
Metareality Core
.
Forms
[

The form that we see of him is a cartoonish looking set of eyes, a mouth and hands, all floating miraculously. It has been determined that his shown form is somehow made of a mixture of Alpha and Omega, so is
HIS HOME
, how he has been able to do this without becoming impossibly unstable is beyond our comprehension.
Morality
[
]
He does not have any evil intentions, however he is not exactly a God of 'peace'. His moral alignment would
definitely
be Chaotic Neutral. He can and
will
ERASE* any who dare oppose him. He is stronger than even
Bongus
, and other gods of Bongus's rank. (*ERASING meaning to disassemble their
Blueprint Particles
)
The Primorial
[
]
The "Primorial" is a version of the Primordial created via
the Ripoff
. Unlike the Primordial, the Primorial is a very weak cosmic entity who is obsessed with primorials, which are factorials which use prime numbers instead of natural numbers.
