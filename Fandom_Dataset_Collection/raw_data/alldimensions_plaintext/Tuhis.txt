The Tuhis come from
UNI-5039
, and are slightly hostile. They evolved from spiders on their planet, which ate types of fungi that turned them into sort of “Mushroom Spiders”. After a few hundred million years, they evolved to be way bigger, smarter and stronger. They can easily destroy a car by using its legs, and can possibly destroy a small building. At age 2, they can talk(using sorts of clicks, but develop speaking muscles later)(also 1 Tuhisian year = 5 Human years), At age 5, they can finally use their speaking muscles to communicate. At age 10, they are considered adults, and at age 25, they are fully grown. They typically have a lifespan of 57 years (285 human years).
