A not to scale example of the structure of the Omniverse's repetitive Archverses
Reality
is made out of objects and voids. Technically, one could say that Reality is made out of objects alone, as voids are simply
a lack of objects
. These objects are mostly
verses
, verse variants, boxes, random cosmic structures and more.
Verses are laid out in a totally random formation
, resembling that of apollonian circle packing, but with very large gaps between everything and, obviously, allowing for circles within circles. Sometimes, these “packings” have very visible patterns, sometimes they are harder to notice and in most cases, it is just pure randomness. According to size / place, verses may not follow this specific rule set. Sometimes, verses are ordered and patterned, like
Archverses
, but in most cases, verses are randomly scattered.
Just like Reality, it is very chaotic trying to explain its nature, as nothing is simply a black or white case, but an infinitely complex picture.
The
Omniverse
has chaotic scattering, but not so much for sizes. For the most part, a verse A which is superior to verse B
will have many verses like B, both in size and similarity
. The best example of this is, again, the Archverses. Same sizes, same properties, they are at the bottom of the chain and
Universes
very rarely have their own verses.
On larger scales, patterns are much more pronounced and survive for longer, as many more events need to occur for longer periods of time to break them apart, and even then, the disruptive processes are akin to continuous transformations and as such, patterns are still retained. In any way, formations and clusters of verses seem to acquire many patterns regardless of what is happening to them.
Civilizations take advantage of this fact to set up home bases with symmetric shapes and then customize them to fit their own laws.
