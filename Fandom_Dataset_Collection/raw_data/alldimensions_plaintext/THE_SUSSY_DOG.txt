(This is WIP)
Sussy dog is truly the strongest in this entire verse, it’s power level is beyond highest numbers that humans have invented, he can decided for things to not exist and it would just happen because his power is far beyond measurable. Sussy dog originally died in his first life because he got killed by a chef but he got reborned and started his villain arc. The sussy dog his villain arc and is the most powerful being in this entire verse.
Sussy dog is not an omnipotent god, he is the absolute infinite to the absolute infinite power times the absolute infinite of an omnipotent god, he can just do anything in his brain and it would just happen, he needs to do nothing and he can destroy absolute everything and he was self created.
beyond countless Omni verses, every single mirror chains, the allsphere and the imprecievable plane, which is beyond everything single level of beyond of every  and way beyond all of that of impossible. Yet the bald kid manages to destroy all of them by accidentally breathing, which he doesn’t need because he is way beyond powerful
he easily surpasses jerald and destroys every single cosmic entity and transcends beyond reality and is literally outside between fiction and reality. Only if it blinks its eye.
His aura is so powerful it can remove the most powerful entities ever and not even the bald kid or Hugo boss could penetrate his aura. It has to take around 50000 the bald kids to penetrate the Sussy dogs aura which is already the weakest layer of power on the sussy dogs aura.
His second layer is an invisible shield and if 50000000000 Hugo bosses punch the shield with full force it would only to 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of the sussy dogs shield can make his shield go back to not being damaged at all when its damaged which is literally impossible.
He can destroy every single fictional character by just saying “wake up to reality”
He absolutely destroys
