The
block of pork
(BOP for short) or
Blork
as a more formal name is a very bizarre but also dangerous
entity
. Mightier than most and with fiction-threatening abilities, this mf is lowkey scary, which is quite unfitting considering its somewhat stupid design. It is considered as a
Pageversal
level threat, just like other
Wikinomalies
. Being a Wikinomaly means it represents a main concept of the
Wikiverse
it is in, and Blork is known specifically as the
incarnation of chaos
due to having a lot of abilities related to the mass destruction of things.
Appearance
[
]
It is shaped like a block with a raw pork meat texture on it, something that can be observed in the infobox's image. Do NOT let its appearance fool you, though.
Abilities
[
]
Crash
[
]
Causes a freezing, time stop-like effect on an area enough to cover an entire average Wikiverse, and can even affect beings comparable to its power level. Slight corruptions also happen when this ability is activated. Can be focused on specific targets, reducing the area but increasing its strength on the reduced one.
Deletion
[
]
Similar to the previous one, but this time being about existence erasure rather than freezing / time stopping. Can only be made after at least three crashes were made beforehand

, for some reason. Plot reasons.
Those who pork
[
]
This is Blork's Ultimate ability, which can... cramp either entities, places or both, whatever that means. It somehow is more dangerous than the deletion agaisnt structures like Wikiverses, and it even has some durability bypass properties. Can only be made after at least three crashes AND one deletion beforehand
[

]
, and when BOP is about to use it, it needs to shout "those who pork" for some reason, giving the name of this ability.
Pork licker
[
]
Summon
[
]
Block of pork can summon several entities known as pork lickers, up to 8 of them. They help in fights and roughly have a third of Blork's strength each. It takes a while for BOP to summon each one, though.
Fusion
[
]
If block of pork can spawn all 8 possible pork lickers, it can fuse with them, turning into a being known as the
block of pork lickers
AKA "Blorkill" (Check its section for more information).
Dream manipulation
[
]
One of the least dangerous abilities. BOP can appear in dreams and use its abilities on them, but it cannot use it to actually damage the entities it is using that ability on, but rather to simply annoy them. Its so powerful not even
TOGs
are immune to it, though in an actual fight the TOGs can obviously beat it like any other pre-
transfictional
entities. It doesnt even need to be summoned in order to manifest itself in dreams with this ability.
Boss fight theme
[
]
It can make boss fight music start playing out of nowhere. You know, in order to make fights better.
Weaknesses
[
]
Can run out of stamina, making it unable to spam abilities properly.
Anti-corruption attacks can counter it if powerful enough.
Story
[
]
Blork's origins are unknown, and kind of irrelevant if we are honest. It simply was... there, from the very beggining, meaning it counts as a
Primordial entity
. What IS known though is that it needs to be manually summoned via artifacts known as
raw porkchops
. Not any normal raw porkchops, but rather ones looking the same as the minecraft ones which are found across our Wikiverse. You need to find all 9 of them and put them together so they fuse into the block of pork. You cant just duplicate one of them in order to make the task easier, you NEED to manually find the randomized location of each one. If Blork is beaten, it'll split into the 9 porkchops which go back to random positions once more. BOP will die if these are destroyed, though they are roughly as durable as a
home Pageverse
so it wont be easy to do so.
Personality
[
]
BOP can be considered as a chaotic evil entity, since its highly agressive simply because it is one crazy fella. It LOVES using its dream manipulation ability to ruin other entities' dreams too. It is hostile even to the ones that summon it.
Trivia
[
]
Block of pork, its abilities, story, etc. is based from
this
post which related a dream about a minecraft's "block of pork" messing with the dreams of the poster in an absurd way.
Block of pork has an offspring known as
cheese wheel
or
Wheese
, the incarnation of armageddon. It is pretty similar to Blork regarding the way it can be summoned too, needing 9 artifacts known as cheese slices in order to be generated.
Regarding how did Blork have an offspring, we could say it was the result of a piece of Blork separating from it and developing into its own entity. This doesn't mean Wheese is weak though, since it roughly has 80% the strength of its creator.
Regarding their relationship, they treat eachother as allies, barely caring about their biological bond.

Pork lickers
[
]
(Infobox isnt ready yet)
Introduction
[
]
Pork lickers
are extremly fierce and powerful warriors generated by the block of pork (BOP/Blork). Just because they are the underlings of the main threat doesnt mean they arent dangerous by themselves, since they roughly have a third of the strength of their creator's base form, meaning even a single rogue pork licker can be a threat for fiction. Only 8 of them can exist at the same time, and it takes a while to generate each one, though if all 8 of them are made and are still alive they can fuse with the BOP and turn into the "block of pork lickers" (BOPL) aka "Blorkill".
The reason of the word "licker" being in their name is because their tongues are actually their main weapon, and it has several abilities which makes them far more intimidating than what their name may indicate. This doesnt mean they are useless without it, though.
Appearance
[
]
T.B.A.
Abilities
[
]
Melee combat
[
]
Pork lickers are extremly good brawlers, knowing how to fight even if one or several abilities of them are restricted in some way. They arent as reliant with them as the BOP itself is.
Tongue
[
]
Unlike most entities, their tongues have their whole use based on being weapons for the pork lickers, mostly working as a whip.
Another odd thing is that their hands have holes where the tongue can come from, meaning they can attack from several places at once.
Blunt lick
[
]
The basic tongue attack, simply yet in a very efficient way working as a blunt hit towards the enemy.
Time-stopping lick
[
]
This version of the lick can cause a weaker version of the crash ability the BOP has, being able to freeze objects and/or enemies in place. Can only hit a few targets at once.
Cramp lick
[
]
Similar to the previous one but instead of freezing it cramps their opponents if they're hit. Basically a stronger blunt lick with some durability bypass.
Fusion
[
]
If 8 pork lickers are made and all of them are both still alive and close enough to the BOP, they can all fuse with it at once and turn into the block of pork lickers (BOPL).
Endurance
[
]
A pork licker can survive with several missing limbs or even without their head since their main organ is the tongue, though the "external" and much less vulnerable part of it is the one used in combat, explaining why they can use it in combat in such a direct way.
Weaknesses
[
]
If they get too far away from their summoner, they decay and pass away after some time.
Even though its been mentioned that they can still fight even if they lose part of their tongue, the pain that is caused if it gets damaged will still weaken them. The part of their tongues that isnt used in combat (the "internal" part basically) also works as their brains so the full destruction of their tongues is death by default for them.
Hitting with their tongues too hard can end up making them injure their own tongues by accident.
They are pretty much mindless by themselves and only "work" thanks to being connected with their summoner's consciousness, so if block of pork doesnt pay enough attention they could end up getting controlled by someone else. If they are too far away from the BOP and thus cant get the orders because of that they enter in a rogue state and can fight once more, though.
NOTE: this section is lacking a lot of content for now.
Block of pork lickers
[
]
Introduction
[
]
The
block of pork lickers
(BOPL for short) AKA
Blorkill
is the ultimate form of both the block of pork (BOP/Blork) and the pork lickers. It is made by the fusion of them, specifically being the result of 8 pork lickers combining with Blork.
Measuring BOPL's strength
[
]
For this section, lets pretend block of pork's strength is equal to 1. Since each pork licker is a third of its strength they'd have a power of 0.33, though 8 of them means all of them at once reach ~2,66 strength.
1 + ~2,66 = ~3,66
This means block of pork lickers is close to being 4 times stronger than its base form. Not that big of a proportional increase in strength compared to transformations of other entities, but since BOP's base strength is already insanely high its still quite a big difference and increase.
Appearance
[
]
Blorkill is similar to its base form appearance-wise, but with a redder color scheme and 8 smaller blocks (which will be mentioned as "minicubes") on it which have the texture of the pork lickers, obviously representing them. These can be moved by the BOPL in different ways and even slighty change their size, but it mostly preffers having 6 of them on its top looking like horns (3 minicubes for each one) and 2 larger ones on its sides as some kind of hands. It also gains a face, making it able to have facial expressions.
Weaknesses
[
]
Yes, we NEED to put this section above the abilities one, because the first weakness mentioned is extremly important.
If it receives a decent amount of damage the minicubes will start to break, weakening Blorkill and even blocking some of the exclusive abilities this form has if enough cubes are destroyed. These cannot be regenerated unless it goes back to its normal form, gathers 8 pork lickers and fuses again. If all minicubes are lost, the fusion ends and it returns to its base form.
We'll use the calculations to measure its strength we already used in order to know the strength loss. As an example, if it loses one minicube it means it loses the strength of one pork licker, so ~3,66 power - ~0,33 power  = ~3,33 power.
Excessive use of the minicubes in a relatively short amount of time can make them run out of energy thus also rendering them useless, though they can be recharged over time so its not as bad as straight up losing them in battle.
Minicubes cannot turn back into pork lickers after the fusion.
Abilities
[
]
Blorkill has the abilities of Blork but clearly stronger and more spammable. Example: the "those who pork" ability doesnt need it to shout the words in order to make it work now. It also has new ones:
Cramp slash
[
]
These can be made if at least one minicube is standing, though two of them is the minimum for the ability to function with its full strength. These are extremly spammable slashes which can cramp and damage the opponent.
Cramp ray
[
]
One minicube for it to work. Generates a ray which also has the cramping status, though its stronger but FAR less spammable, so its less dangerous than the slash. The more it hits the more the cramp works, obviously.
Mega cramp ray
[
]
Six minicubes for it to work. Same as the previous one but at a much larger scale, and its pretty much the strongest attack that Blorkill can produce. BOPL likes to use its horns' minicubes to generate the mega cramp ray because it looks neat to it.
Self cramp
[
]
All eight minicubes are needed for this ability to work. With this, BOPL can use the cramp ability on itself. You may think this ability is useless and straight up counterproductive at first, but it can even cramp its own "negative" concepts such as the concept of receiving damage, making it immortal for example. This counts as a corruption ability though, so strong enough anti-corruption attacks can get rid of those buffs.
Wheese summon
[
]
Blorkill is able to summon its offspring
Wheese
via using telekinesis and attracting the nine cheese slices needed for its generation.
Aporkcalypse
[
]
[REDACTED, NOT YET]
Trivia
[
]
As its minicubes get destroyed, its color scheme gradually goes back to the one its base form has, which shows its losing the battle if that happens.

This doesnt mean it is forced to use this ability right after using the previous ones in their specific amount of times, though.
