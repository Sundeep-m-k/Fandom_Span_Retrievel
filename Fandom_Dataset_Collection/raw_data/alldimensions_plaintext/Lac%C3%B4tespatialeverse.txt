The Interior
The Lacôtespatialeverse is a large structure found in the Omniverse, it is very similar to
Our Universe
.
The Lacôtespatialeverse is very old, aging about 1.4 trillion years, and the age was easily identified because of the "Negative" Cold Stars, Stars that undergo Nuclear fusion under Negative Temperature, since the laws of physics in this verse is different, it lets the Temperature drop down as cold as -1 × 10^30 Celsius, and there are special particles here called "Repairons" which fix the spacetime rip during the process of an object cooling down lower than -250°c.
The Lacôtespatialeverse is home to many galaxies, the Central one (as shown in the infobox image) is called the Kalermo Galaxy, and it is also the Central Galaxy of the Entire Verse, there is also a star to the top right of the galaxy that is one of the most brightest stars in the Lacôtespatialeverse Called
Layaman
.

Stars
[
]
Most stars in the Lacôtespatialeverse are mostly Red dwarfs, Stellar Remnants, Brown dwarfs, Black stars, Cold Stars or even Repairon Stars
Cold "Negative" Stars
[
]
As said, Cold "Negative" Stars are Stars that undergo Nuclear Fusion in the Opposite Temperature, These Cold Negative Stars (Abbreviation: CNgS) Range temperatures from -225°c up to -1,000,000°c (by type), and they range colors from Blue, and to purple. They mostly form in environments similar to the Boomerang Nebula, and they Typically last about billions to trillions of years depending on the type
Cold Negative Neutron Stars
[
]
Since the physics of this verse is different to ours, it allows Cold Negative Neutron Stars (Abbreviated as: CNgNS), which spins in "Negative" directions, allowing it to cool itself (according to the physics of the verse itself) Cold Negative Neutron Stars are Stellar Remnants of Cold Negative Stars.
Discovery
[
]
this Verse was discovered in 2338 by the Redlandian Multiversal Telescope Survey (RMTS) when they were trying to scan objects in the sky.
It was first detected by
Firey Jr. Jr.
, whos a professional at discovering things.
