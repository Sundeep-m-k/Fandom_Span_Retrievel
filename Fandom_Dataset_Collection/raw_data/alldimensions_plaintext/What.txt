What is an
entity
that rules over a
Questionable Plain
in it's entirety and is the absolute source of questioning, thinking, wondering, and psychology on it. What also controls the 2nd absolute source of the aforementioned list,
Philosiphynius
. It controls all theories about it and all hypothesis about it as well. Every single person you've ever seen or any entity you've ever heard of is a part of What.
It can kill all entities and is very evil and mean.
Power
[
]
What can control not only all things remotely relating to questions on its Questionable Plain, it can also confuse any entity trying to kill it.
This means that any information on how to destroy this entity can be completely removes, and also means this entity can't even be defeated by the likes of
Gerald
,
Dunkey Kong
, or any other
omni-god
. The onlything that can defeat it are
Betasms
or above.
It can make any verse/plains/place/etc be confused and make all facts in it messed up. It can also change the facts of itself, except bolded text for some reason, so only listen to only the bolded text please.
Actually, no, don't, as the person writing in bold text is a liar. Also, "what's" favorite food is blue cheese left out in the sun to curdle for a decade.
Age
[
]
What is the oldest thing on its Questionable Plain. It's older than some
Cores of Everything
, the
Core's Void
, and even some
Realms
. It is so old it makes some entities say "What?", which makes it stronger.
Knowledge
[
]
What's knowledge is absolute
. It is higher than even users of all except the highest level Core of Everythings, as it can manipulate the information given to them to defeat What and use it to make any entities with access to it defeat themselves.
However, What is a peaceful entity, so it likely would never do anything like this.
