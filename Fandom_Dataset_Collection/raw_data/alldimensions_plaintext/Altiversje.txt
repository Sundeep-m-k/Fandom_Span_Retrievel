An altiversje (alternate + verse (container) + je (small)) is a versje so small or so large they defy the concept of size. They are the cosmic equivalent to dividing or multiplying by 0.
Like all metaversjes, it is an abstraction of reality and not actually a thing.

Containment

]
Altiversjes all contain an infinitely large hierarchy of versjes and are stacked on top of eachother. Due to the nature of their size, they are both positive or negative sized compared to eachother. Altiversjes also have no way of interacting with eachother, but there are an infinite amount of micraltiversjes inside any altiversje.
Loops

Sometimes a versje inside an altiversje contains itself. When this happens, there can be no more versjes above it. Since altiversje hierarchies are infinite, this always happens, causing there to be an "end" versje inside every altiversje.
There can also be versjes that contain itself on a lower level, which has the opposite effect by making it so there can be no more versjes below it and becoming a "beginning" versje. As with the "end" versje, this always happens.

Macraltiversje
[
]
Macraltiversjes are what altiversjes that are greater than the one youre in are called. They appear to be both positively and negatively infinite in size.
Micraltiversje
[
]
Micraltiversjes are what altiversjes that are smaller than the one youre in are called. They appear to have no size at all and are both positively and negatively infinite in abundance.
