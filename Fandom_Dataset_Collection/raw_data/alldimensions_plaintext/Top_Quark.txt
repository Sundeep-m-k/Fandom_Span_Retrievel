The
top quark
, sometimes also referred to as the
truth quark
, (symbol: t) is the most massive of all observed
elementary particles
. It derives its mass from its coupling to the
Higgs Boson
. This coupling  is very close to unity; in the Standard Model of particle physics, it is the largest (strongest) coupling at the scale of the weak interactions and above. The top quark was discovered in 1995 by the CDF and DØ experiments at Fermilab.
Like all other
quarks
, the top quark is a
fermion
with spin
1
/
2
and participates in all four fundamental interactions: gravitation, electromagnetism, weak interactions, and strong interactions. It has an electric charge of +
2
/
3
e. It has a
mass
of 172.76±0.3 GeV/c
2
,which is close to the rhenium atom mass. The
antiparticle
of the top quark is the
top antiquark
(sometimes called antitop quark or simply antitop), which differs from it only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.
The top quark interacts with
gluons
of the strong interaction and is typically produced in hadron colliders via this interaction. However, once produced, the top (or antitop) can decay only through the weak force. It decays to a
W boson
and either a
bottom quark
(most frequently), a
strange quark
, or, on the rarest of occasions, a
down quark
.
The top quark contains a
String

The Anti-Strange Quark, Strange Antiquark or just Antistrange is the exact same thing as an Charm Quark, except the charge is negative, so the Anti-Strange Quark just has a charge of +

A strange quark decays into an
Up Quark
and a
W
-
Boson
, which is short lived, and decays into an
electron
and an
Electron antineutrino
. An example of this decay is the decay of a Kaon minus (K
-
) particle. It lives about 10
-8
seconds, which is ridiculously short. When it decays, it forms a π
0
Pion
(This is that particle that decays into an
up quark
). It also creates an
electron
and an
Electron antineutrino
.
