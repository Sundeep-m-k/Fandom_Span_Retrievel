MetaXule
is the 3rd level of verse-types in
The Xicohtlxul
. Much like it's metaverse counterpart, which contains multiverses, a metaXule contains multiXule's which themselves contain UniXule's.
Not much is known about MetaXule's at this time, however we can make some reasonable assumptions. Continuing the pattern establishing by UniXules and MultiXules, a MetaXule is likely an 81-Dimensional space, composed of many many 54D lattices which forms the matrix of MultiXules that form it's structure. Another theory is that it contains 108-Dimensions, based on repeatedly doubling the number of dimensions.
In terms of size, we may also assume it dwarfs a MultiXule in the same way that a MultiXule dwarfs a UniXule, itself already quite insanely large, passing up most finite verses.
Beyond this, there is not too much that can be speculated about MetaXule's. It's possible there are other parameters that change within it's structure.
