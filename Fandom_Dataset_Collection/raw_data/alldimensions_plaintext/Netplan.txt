A
Netplan
is a type of
planet
that has a negative size and dimensionality. Netplans are contained by
Protoverses
, null-sized
structures
.
Netplans share many similarities with normal planets, in that they usually host life, can be terrestrial or gaseous, etc. However, the similarities end there, with netplans orbiting negative moons, and negative suns orbiting a netplan.
Instead of
atoms
, netplans are made up of
Verseunis
, and are contained by a Protoverse instead of a
galaxy
or an
universe
.
Netplans aren't the most stable structures either, as they need naturally generated forcefields which stops them from imploding. For example, in the infobox's image we can see a netplan similar to
Earth
appearance-wise being surrounded by a purple forcefield.
