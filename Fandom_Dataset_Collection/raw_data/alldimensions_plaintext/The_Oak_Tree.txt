The oak tree is a tree that is found in the
Room
. It is in a plant pot filled with rich black soil. It has an
acorn
on one of it's stems that creatures live in but it doesn't grow anymore acorns. For some reason it can grow
apples
which drop from the tree. Nothing attacks the tree except for omnipotent gods who actually want wood from the tree because the tree has an
immune system
that destroys everything that tries to invade it. The omnipotent gods have been granted special access to the wood because they need it to repair things like the table from the
shadow
. It also has the same things a
table
has on the soil and in the acorn. Unlike a table, it doesn't have a
shadow
like thing underneath it because the tree's immune system destroyed it. No one knows how the tree came into existence or how old it is.
