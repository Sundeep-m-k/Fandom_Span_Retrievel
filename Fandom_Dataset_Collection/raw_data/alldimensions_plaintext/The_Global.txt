The Snowglobe
The Global contains an Immeasurable amount of Snowglobes. It is one of the largest verses known, and it has 3 sections: the hot section, the cold section, and the mild temperature section. Basically the Parent Snowglobe. You can see the resemblance of a wine glass.. Only the Philosophers we're strong enough to 'drink' out of it.

The images' orange side shows the hot section. The hot section is (pretend there's a number here that not even an all knowing being can think of that's not a concept) celsius at the edge of the global, and fades to 65° celsius as you get closer to the centre. Many beyond Absolute Omnifinite Snowglobes are found here.
Mild Temperature
[

this side is the centre, where it is about 25° celsius in the centre. You can find a beyond Absolute Omnifinite amount of Snowglobes here.
Cold Temperature

At the images' blue area, it fades from negative (pretend there's a number here that not even an all knowing being can think of that's not a concept) degrees celsius at the edge of the global to 35° as you near the centre. A Beyond Absolute amount of Snowglobes are located here.
