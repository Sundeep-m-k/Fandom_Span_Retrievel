The Boqqolakverse is a verse which contains the boqqolak civilisation. They are an advanced civilisation which has a strong focus on understanding their verse but are unaware with any outside it. They warp spacetime and create wormholes around their verse allowing very quick travel to distant locations.
Boqqolak civilisation

they are advanced and a strong military civilisation. Packets of resistence against them in their verse form often and there is often conflict.
Spacetime
[
]
Imagine the universe is a trampoline with lots of little objects on it. Depending on the weight of the objects, it bends the part they are on downwards. It is the same for spacetime. Spacetime is the net of the trampoline; it bends around objects that have mass. This mass creates gravity. Because spacetime bends this way it might be possible and does not contradict known laws of quantum physics for wormholes to exist, but these laws are uncomplete.
