The
Cubic Otherstructures
are
cubes
floating around near the
Otherverses
, which don't contain gravity formed from
negaexistent
things. However, they're made of weirdly, existent light and unknown material made of
hyperradioactive
elements, mostly tetraradioactivity consisting of exotic Primordium particles.
They're pretty much a
Barrel
equivalent of the
Other Boxes
which naturally contain
Outsides
and existent
pseudo-omniverses
. However, the Outsides in them have a weaker force than usual due to negaexistence nearby but negaexistence eradicating you away as you traverse, making these almost inescapable from inside.
Due to the natural phenomena from the Other Boxes, they can't be moved and destroyed except by
Acic Fields
. However, there are several theories residing with these structures. In the best case, it is theorized that Cubic Otherstructures have metaexistent-icosahedral Acic Fields for protection and repulsion. In the other hand, they have
protospatial particles
sliding off for stronger Acic Fields.
They're used as the main structures to protect Otherverses' natural phenomenons from existent civilizations. Commonly, they are also used to research negaexistence and lower existence ranks for primitive
Cetaversal
-tier spaceships and metaexistent technologies. For example, when negaexistence is mixed with
Dimensional Blueprint Particles
, it voids the existence throughout looped dimensions, allowing to traverse through Barrels safely.
