Boos Norpekryf has been of much use to civilizations and other entities, and Boos Norpekryf has been used to essentially lock civilizations and other entities in time.
Boos Norpekryf, other than being used as a way to timefreeze civilizations and creatures, also has many other uses, and is currently being studied by civilizations all over the cosmos. A specialized container for Boos Norpekryf has been constructed for the entity to go inside of and allow scientists to study it, but Boos Norpekryf has frequently tried to escape the container. Due to this, the container is no longer used and Boos Norpekryf freely roams the cosmos.
Attempting to enter a verse with Boos Norpekryf is inside of it will just freeze you in time, making the entity extremely dangerous.
Boos Norpekryf has been used a few times to time-freeze verses as a way to study civilizations without getting severely damaged by them in case they are hostile.

The Explanation Behind Boos Norpekryf's Ability
[
]
It is thought that Boos Norpekryf exists in all time dimensions, and whenever it enters a containing body, it "severs" the timeline/'timesquare'/'timecube', etc. of the verse, thus allowing the things in the verse to not experience time. It is unknown why Boos Norpekryf seemingly does this automatically whenever it is in a container or how it manages to experience time when everything around it doesn't.
Ways Used to Hide From Boos Norpekryf
[
]
Due to Boos Norpekryf's potentially dangerous abilities, many creatures have opted to hide in
Lockverses
, as a Lockverse's barrier is completely indestructable. However, only a few creatures and civilizations have done this as the only possible way to go into a Lockverse is via teleportation, and teleportation can be very risky at times. Some more advanced civilizations hide in Time Protectors, which are a form of advanced technology that is meant to prevent time freezes or loops, although these donâ€™t always work against Boos Norpekryf. Success rate is about 32%.
