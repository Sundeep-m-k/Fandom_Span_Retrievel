The
Videlyubap Republic
is a country in UNI-9. The republic has 6 galaxies under its rule. Its main and original species is the Videlyumbappés. Its capital city, Guabadibi, is in the native planet of the Videlyumbappés, Pagratayu. Somehow they have advanced with high-tech FTL travel and other crazy things while having an extremely underdeveloped economic system, where you can just find shiny shit and trade it for basically anything. Due to this, as of 11,360

Species
[
]
While the Videlyubap Republic now has thousands of species due to its expansion, its native species is the Videlyumbappés. They are just a bunch of random circles and sticks jumbled together.
Their average IQ is around 12, but they're kinda like ants where a colony (in this case the republic) of Videlyumbappés is much more intelligent than just 1.
A bunch of Videlyumbappés
Their average height is 30 centimeters and their average lifespan was 5 years before the beginning of technological advancement. Now, most of their lifespans are 30 years, and some of them don't even die of old age anymore.
