Meatverses
Meatoidverses
are the ultimate versions of the
Meatverses
. Just like the formers, they are constantly being eaten by beings named the
Flyoids
. The meat they're made of is slighty darker and drier than the one Meatverses have.
Meatoidverses are most of the time located in the cores of
Dodecahedron of CHAIRs
, uncapable of moving somewhere else due to the core's massive gravity, sometimes even fusing Meatoidverses with others of their own kind. Flyoids are a constant danger for the Dodecahedron's cores due to them being so hungry they eat the Meatoidverses inside them.
Life
[
]
Similar to the Meatverses, Meatoidverses are plentiful of carnivorous lifeforms. In fact, tons of beings in Meatoidverses consume Meatverses daily due to them being extremly nutritious. Only the Flyoids became so powerful they could ALSO eat entire Meatoidverses.
Trivia
[
]
Some gods like to cook Meatoidverses, but first they must fight Flyoids in order to not loose the food.
Sometimes the Flyoids themselves cook the Meatoidverses.
