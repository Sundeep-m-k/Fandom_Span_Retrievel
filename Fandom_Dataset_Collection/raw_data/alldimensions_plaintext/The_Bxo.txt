is a
Box
that experienced a major corruption event. These events can include getting hit with a hypothetical Magnitude ω
Sproyong
, getting hit with usually infinite-sized chunks of
Toxicium
or
Glitchonicite
, and more. Occasionally, Bxoes gain a lot of momentum and escape their local
Cetaverse
into their
Mandelbrotverse

"Cannibal Blueprint Particles"
[

Ditto, but some time has passed.
When a
Box
collides with a Bxo, both dissolve into
Blueprint Particles
colloquially known as "Cannibal Blueprint Particles" because they consume other
Blueprint Particles
and
·s
. They do not consume other Cannibal Blueprint Particles. These Blueprint Particles are very dangerous because they are virtually invisible, can consume entire
Omniverses
within milliseconds and there are no known defenses against them. This makes traversing
Cetaverses
very dangerous at times. It is still not known why a colliding Bxo and Box form these cannibalistic Blueprint Particles, but further research is being done. Two Bxos colliding with each other do not make Cannibal Blueprint Particles.
After this,
The Box
moves to its final stage, which is when it explodes, it is called
The Bxx
