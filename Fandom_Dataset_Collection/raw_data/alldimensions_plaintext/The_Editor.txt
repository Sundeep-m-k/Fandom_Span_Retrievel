The Editor
is supposedly the maker of this entire wiki, according to all the different creatures and species that exist within this wiki. Of course, The Editor is really just a bunch of average
humans
that work on one mostly fictional (who knows?) wiki called the All Dimensions Wiki, but since those creatures don't know that there is a group or higher beings deciding what happens to them, they just call this higher being 'The Editor'.
Even
Him
,
Bongus
,
Dunkey Kong
,
Gerald
, or basically every entity inside AD cannot beat The Editor, since it can just delete their pages and remove all of their links. The Editor is usually considered the embodiment of every
Transcendent-God
on the wiki. There are also beings higher than Editors, the Supreme Editors, or mostly just dubbed "Mods". These people have absolute control of everything and can ban other editors if they break the rules. There are also 2 Ultimate Editors who have control over the whole fandom. Their names are Jimmy Wales and Angela Beesley Starling. They created fandom in the first place.
Also, there are multiple Editors, many can compete with one another and restore links and recreate the page again by pure free choice.
