The devourerverse exists because of an evil group of strange entities called devourers, who ate everything in sight until they eventually finished eating their first class 3 verse, and they were deemed too powerful so they were banished to an oversized multiverse, and they were fed with universes and multiverses. The devourers corrupted the verse with evil and it started to eat away at the
omniverse
, so the multiverse was sent to the outer voids of
The Outside
, and was fed multiverses to keep it satisfied.
Devourer/devourer king
what does he rule over anyway?
Nothing/devourers and devourerverse
Powerfulness, I guess
Extremely strong, could take down an army of 2626 googolplex humans in a few seconds/extremely strong, could take down an army of 62727228 googolplex humans in less than a second. Exactly 239090 times stronger than a normal Devourer.
Good or evil?
EVIL
Goals
eat everything
Limits
Can’t escape the devourerverse.
Weaknesses
Anything that can fit a devourer in it’s mouth. Why? Because devourers, ironically, are weak to being eaten!
So, you are wondering what this banished evil multiverse is called? Well, the devourerverse, of course! The devourers also have a king, who is even stronger. And even hungrier...
If the devourers escape their prison, than god have mercy on their souls...
each devourer likes to eat (duh), but they also like to explore. They think of the devourer leader as a god who they must get an autograph of. (lol)
