{0} =
finalboboverse
{1} = repeating the entire Poyo chain before the goboverse and replacing the genericaverse with the
finalboboverse
. then, take the finalboboverse defined in that version of the chain and replace it with the genericaverse from another chain. repeat that
Ω
times
{2} = (insert all rules in {1}). after that, you take the last verse from the Ωth iteration, and repeat the rules in {1} Ω times while replacing the final verse from the Ωth iteration of the last tier 2 iteration and putting it in the next tier 2 iteration.
{3} = repeating all rules in {2} until you get to the Ωth tier Ω tier
