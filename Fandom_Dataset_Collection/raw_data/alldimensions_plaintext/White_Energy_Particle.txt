A
white energy particle
(WEP) is one of two particles findable in the
Energy Production Void
floating around, with the other being the
black energy particle
. A white energy particle is always exactly 1 centimeter in diameter and is also the exact opposite of a Black Energy Particle. If it bounces off of a black energy particle, it creates exactly one terawatt of energy.
If a white energy particle is contacted by something that is not a black energy particle, nothing abnormal will occur.
