The Icosahedron of Punishment is a giant cage for those who disrupt that beyond
Alphasm
. Destroying a verse or two may come at a cost of being sent to the Icosahedron for 1 minute, however disrupting the entire fabric of the Alphasm chain and literally EVERYTHINGNESS BEYOND EVERYTHINGNESS for a prolonged period of time can result in being sent all the way down to the
t e t r a h e d r o n
. Even going down to the dodecahedron takes some rough play to be sent to.

Depth 1: Icosahedron
[
]
Inside the Icosahedron you'll usually only be served a temporary sentence unless you repeat offense on purpose, which then you'll be sentenced permanently. You'll usually get attacked by the other inmates, however that's pretty much it in the icosahedron.
Depth 2: Dodecahedron
[
]
In the dodecahedron, you're locked up in an empty realm where each inmate of the dodecahedron is placed in one of these realms. It acts as a solitary confinement. Soon after a long time you'll sent to the Octahedron for re-education.
Depth 3: Octahedron
[
]
After you serve a sufficient time in the Dodecahedron in solitary confinement or if you escape, you'll be sent to the Octahedron. Here you'll be "re-educated" on what you should and shouldn't do. In here you'll also be sent in for questioning so the council knows why you did what you did. If you fail to comply with re-education, you'll be sent to the Cube.
Depth 4: Cube
[
]
Here, it's a replica of the Icosahedron, except the inmates here are way more hostile. You'll have to constantly fight possibly infinities of inmates at once.
They deserve to be torn apart by eachother for their sins.
If you're bad enough, you'll be able to SKIP the cube all the way down to the tetrahedron.
Depth 5:
t e t r a h e d r o n
[
]
The worst layer of them all. The tetrahedron. You're powerless, you're immortal, you're forcefully used to not feeling pain, but this is forced regardless of the conditions, you're still constantly exposed to
