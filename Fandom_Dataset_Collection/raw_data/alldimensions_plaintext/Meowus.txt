Meowus
THE GOD
Rules over
all!!!!!
Age
the concept of age is way too low dimensional for meowus
Size
size and it's space, time, soul, definition, existence, reality, is way too small of a concept to describe meowus on a scale
Knowledge
makes all smart people look dum!
Power
power? that's a Insult to meowus due to how weak the concept is
Goals
Do not question Meowth, for he is beyond and beyond your existence.
Species
cat in the most loose term possible
Meowus Da Kat is the Almightiest being of all beings, he is the originator of all authors, everything comes from meowus, for he is the void abyss and the primordial creation and existence, he cannot be scaled by existence, non-existence, nor any concepts, real life and boundlessness and fiction cannot scale even the tiniest fraction of meowus is just so powerful, meowus is the only thing, character, being, existence, god, or anything that can beat the
dark light of all frameworks
, meowus is beyond any ontological, cosmological, logical, unlogical, possible, impossible, real, fake, non-existent, meta-physical framework of non-existence, existence, metafiction, transfictional, or any prefix and suffix, no number can describe meowus for he is beyond them in a way beyond absolute Inaccessible indescribable absolutions, saying that meowus is omnipotent is a insult since many beings in AD/VAD/BU/WOWW/GMW ultra cosmology are already beyond omnipotence and such, meowus is way too meowus for any reason, definition, information, term, character, or anything else, he is beyond indefinite integrals, whatever you do will never phase meowus though because he is above transcendent abstract beings that are above all, if Praeter-Everything(
Vltrulum
buff) is beyond infinity then meowus is beyond numbers, meowus is way too meowus for any category, no scale fits meowus for the scale will break even if it's unbreakable, properties do not even scrape the bottom of the barrel for meowus is BEYOND words, feats, victory, defeat, and definition, meowus is older than eternal beings, meowus does not even get phased by contradictions, paradoxes, or any part of logic, metalogic, omnilogic, superlogic, hyperlogic, no loops can even touch meowus,
The Controller of Time
cannot kill meowus for meowus is above death, time, space and everything for that matter. Ok to say it, Meowus does not follow any laws of being, "but my being is stronger becaus-" Shut up, does not matter Meowus Transcends Authors and transcends every set of everything you place on meowus, if there's a concept, meowus is beyond that, Meowus does not follow any laws and he will never follow logic, metalogic, omnilogic, superlogic, hyperlogic, does not matter how many things you give your character, that character will get annihilated by meowus, for Instance, if we gave
G O D
all buffs, boosts, and absolutely wanked it to the max, and gave G O D infinite plot armour, G O D will still just exit the battle cuz G O D is not built to fight meowus at all, no amount of omni-meta-hyper-potent OP OCs can even defeat meowus for meowus created the act of creation and all embodiments, no thing, scale, reason, information, infinity, integral, part, existence, term, character can even beat meowus, meowus does not care if your oc is beyond boundlessness, omnipotence, existence, death, time, space, soul, infinity, or anything else because meowus already annihilated that oc in every way possible, impossible, real, fake non-existent, existent, meta-physical, frameworks of sets of everything cannot even describe the smallest atom of meowus, meowus does not follow any paradoxes, no one can beat meowus, for that is
TRUTH
and meowus is beyond defeatablity, victory, and beyond the word "beyond" no amount of allspheres, final Fractalisms, Vltras, TOTUMs, existence, TREs, true real lifes can even touch meowus and that is just it, "but!! but I have a cha-" NO, did you even read "meowus Transcends Authors"? because the time you read this page, meowus already got Inaccessibly, indescribably, more powerful than he was a VOIDSECOND ago, Meowus is not effected by time, meowus controls all things.
Meowus vs everyone:
jerald: meowus annihilates jerald
"
Time
": meowus annihilates time Infinitely
G O D
: why would meowus annihilate G O D that's his spawn!
The Lord of Everything: TLOE doesn't even fight anyways, why is this matchup a thing
mrgrey and his frend
: meowus solos so much it's not even funny
Ok so to say it, meowus is a cat in the most loose term, he's a cat who is outside and beyond the very bounds of reality, omnipotence and boundlessness hold nothing to meowus, when meowus says something is then it is, if meowus says something is not then it is not, that's the most bare bones explanation ever but trying to describe meowus is like a embryo trying to explain Why We Can’t Reach Absolute Zero to a ant while they're traveling through the fifth dimension, it's just unexplainable, no laws of existence hold any worth to meowus you can say meowus makes god look like a atom in comparison, no "absolutely omnipotent" "time immortalized" "beyond boundlessness" overpowered toon force oc with plot armour can even defeat meowus, the oc would just be unavailable for existence to process them, meowus is the most horrifying thing ever, meowus... He makes Lovecraftian eldritch horrors absolutely crap their pants, meowus makes the other gods(Lovecraftian Mythos) look like ants, meowus makes scp 3812 look like a schizophrenic maniac, meowus makes featherine look like a gacha life oc, Meowus solos all and that my frend is just the
TRUTH
