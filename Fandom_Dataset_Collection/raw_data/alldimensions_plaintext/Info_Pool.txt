An
Info Pool
is a conceptual structure found in numerous areas across the
First Realm
, mostly within
The Soul
. They can be used to extract information from or have information be deposited into it, although their main usage is to project information stored in them in the surrounding area. Info Pools are necessary for sustaining the existence of objective reality, and without them, a large portion of the First Realm would collapse.
Info Pools
have an area of effect in which their information is projected. Larger Info Pools need to be supplied with more information, and smaller ones require less.
If an Info Pool lacks any information for it to project, the Info Pool will quickly cease to exist, and its surroundings will become
nothing
.
Special Functions of Info Pools
[
]
There are a variety of things you can do with Info Pools.
They include:
Duplicating information
Duplicating all of the info (most cosmic entities rarely do this, as it can lead to large scale corruption of information)
"Neutralizing" information (the information is left in, although it is treated as false [meaning that the info would not be projected])
Metainfo Pools
[
]
A select few Info Pools transcend the AD cosmology, and extend into real life. These Info Pools are named as Metainfo Pools. The name has been criticized for its unoriginality, although it has never been changed. There have been numerous occasions when
Transcendent Omni-Gods
have taken information from Metainfo Pools and added the information over to the
Wikiverse
