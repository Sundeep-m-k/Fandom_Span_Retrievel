The
Galinacio Supernebula
is a supernebula in the outer edges of the
Local Universe Group
, near UNI-9. The nebula is composed of mainly normal and neutral matter, and is expected to start creating new universes in a few billion years. It is 20 million lightyears in size.
Formation
[
]
The Galinacio Supernebula is believed to have been the remnants of a ronnanova, the explosion that a dying ronnagiant star produces. This ronnanova is estimated to have happened 20 billion years ago. Stars of insane mass lke ronnanovas are mostly made up of
hyperradioactive elements
, and these elements are only stable in the high pressures of giant stars like these, so when the pressure was let out by the ronnanova a hyper chain reaction happened that caused all of the hyperradioactive elements to decay thousands of times. This heavily dispersed the nebula into the size it is today.
Composition
[
]
The supernebula is mainly made up of
neutral matter
, with a minority of normal matter (9%) and even some antimatter (0.02% of the nebula is antimatter, which is still a lot).
Future
[
]
The Galinacio Supernebula will start coalescing in a few regions, but the diversity of matter in it will prevent these regions from becoming stars or black holes. Instead, the regions accumulate more and more matter until the point of creating 2 to 5
Big Bangs
, which will originate
universes
.
