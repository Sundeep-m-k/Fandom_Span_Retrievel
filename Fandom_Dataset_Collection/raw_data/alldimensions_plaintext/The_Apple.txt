. They serve as food to all civilizations in the verses, with small parts taken out of it and put in verses by
THE CREATOR
. The apple is insanely hot, so hot that nothing can live in it. This is to make sure that only THE CREATOR can take and distribute food to the verses and stops anyone from taking more then their share. No one knows how the apple came into existence or how old it is. There are a bunch of smaller apples that grow from the
oak tree
and act just like The Apple. They are also food and act exactly like the big apple.
