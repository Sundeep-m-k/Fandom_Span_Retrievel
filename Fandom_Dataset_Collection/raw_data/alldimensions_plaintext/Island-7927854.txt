geography and ecosystem

]
this island is located in 732th island cluster and has temperatures ranging from -173 to -54 degrees Celsius. In the middle of the island there is a castle where the judge lives, the judge who decides whether a person lives or dies. Around the center of the island there are small systems of houses. If you imagine the island as a solar system, then the castle in the middle of the island is the sun, and the "rings of houses" are orbits. The farther the ring from the center, the greater the distance between the neighboring ring and the less dense it is, and the ring, on the contrary, is larger. There are 10 rings in total. Of the living creatures here are only some plants, insects with a hard shell, polar bears and multi-colored saber-toothed tigers. People also live here, which are divided into subspecies. There are 7 species in total: upright-terrestrial, upright-amphibians, tetrapods, underground-burrowing, flying, woolly-upright, woolly-quadrupeds. Each species is divided into 24 races. "Neighboring" races by color are friends with each other, and more distant ones are at enmity. The scientist Hemwell made a list of all races, which is constructed in such a way that the closest races on the list are friends with each other, and the further one race is from another on the list, the more they are at enmity and the less they cooperate. Hemwell's List: white, yellow, sulphur-yellow, dark red, light red, light orange, violet, lilac, light pink, cobalt-blue, light blue, road-blue, azure, blue, turquoise-blue, mint, green, light green, lime-green, nut-skinned, beige, dark gray, medium gray, silver-gray, copper.
