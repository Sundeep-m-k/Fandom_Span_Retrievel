Contains:
Approximately 13.4 trillion colors (and a few creatures)
The verse is ridiculously saturated, more saturated than even its local Rainbowcosmos and the RGB Box. The colors are usually extremely bright, and any
creature
that enters this verse will usually go blind instantly. That has made surviving in the Colorverse extremely hard.
Objects inside
[
]
There are many objects inside the Colorverse. Most are huge rainbows that are usually 1000 googolplex LY wide, and
stars
that give off a lot of light and heat. The stars tend to glow brown, though. No one knows why that happens.
Dangers
[
]
If you somehow touch one of the rainbows, the approximate area of the part that touched the rainbow will turn into a huge piece of graphite. Some creatures have used that to their advantage, and have built graphite-producing machines. No one knows what they do with the graphite. Some have theorized that their purposes have to do with
Omega Porcelain
, as OP is weak towards graphite, and OP is used in many places as a 'strong material'.
If you look at one of the stars, your whole body will turn into a huge clump of spaghetti. This spaghetti tastes very similar to Spaghetti-Os.
If you step on any of the life present in the Colorverse, your brain will expand until it comes out of your head (or any part that your brain is kept at). Once your brain matter comes in contact with the Colorverse's atmosphere, it will turn into plastic.
