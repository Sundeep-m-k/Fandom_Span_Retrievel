The
Eggverse
is like
our Universe
, but everything (like
galaxies
,
stars
,
planets
, buildings,
objects
,
humans
and even YOU!) are shaped as eggs. Everything is EGG-SHAPED here!
There are also multiple eggverses in all Multiverses, each with different laws of physics (such as instead of everything being shaped as a chicken egg, it might also be shaped as an ostrich egg, quail egg and so on) so this makes it also a type of universe, they can be as small as an atom to as big as a bunch of universes put together!
