Glass Particles
(or G-Type particles) are exotic particles that are commonly found in
dokaverses
. When they are not being acted upon by the extreme forces of hendaversal storms, they can join together to create larger, generally amorphous structures. They're not actually glass, and their name comes from Richard Glass who was its discoverer. They have the peculiar property of being so large they are visible to humans, being 5 millimeters.
Formation
[
]
Glass particles generally form from the extreme pressures that are created by the hendaversal storms inside a dokaverse. They are created from the excess energy and are immediately accelerated quadrillions of times the speed of light by the storm, being able to stay inside the same storm for thousands of
OYC
. When a Glass particle leaves a hendaversal storm, it becomes background radiation in the dokaversal void, but it can join other Glass particles to create glasteroids (the term used to describe an asteroid made of Glass particles).
Collisions
[
]
Glass particles are very unpredictable when colliding with other things:
Blueprint particles and smaller - The particle is absorbed into the Glass particle, making it an infinitesimal% bigger.
Normal matter: A large explosion is made, as the Glass particle and the matter are consumed.
