The logical terminator is a very weird verse. It can see all of dimensions and move through every dimension, despite only being 3D. It's also sentient. It can also destroy unprotected particles and entities. Most of them are protected though, but stuff like negative sized things aren't. Don't even TRY to trap this thing. It can just move through the higher dimension and escape just like that. It's also spherical. It can also enter and exit just pretty much everything, even
The Sphere
, as it can move through any dimension it wants. Logical terminators are very rare because they're constantly exploring all the different verses through dimensional hopping. They can easily be found though if you have access to every dimension.
It can also defend itself by sucking in dangerous things, even if the dangerous thing is bigger than the Logical Terminator or has more dimensions. This is done by defying logic yet again. It then traps the thing for the rest of eternity.
