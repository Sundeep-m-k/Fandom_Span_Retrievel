The superstringverse is a verse found inside quantum foam. Inside of it is everything in existence, but it is still contained by something so small. This makes it clear that there is infinite of everything and for every superstringverse there is a whole new set of verses. This also means that our universe contains an insanely large amount of these, but is contained inside of one as well, and that one is also contained by a universe, which is contained by a superstringverse, and so on! However, this verse can only contain positive sized matter, meaning that there are still objects smaller than it, despite superstringverses being infinitely small (and large).
