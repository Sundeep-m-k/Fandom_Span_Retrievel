⬤, the building block of mathematical and physical logic, has been an object ever since the first
·s
collided. Typically, it is naturally/artificially used to generate/define properties, or (rarely) to bloat an object with unnecessary properties to prevent detection of paradoxes like ·.
Most of ⬤'s properties are hidden away, so that only one property is set/created to prevent contradictions, which can lead into · forming.

⬤s colliding with
Blueprint Particles
lead to the same result of the collision of · and Blueprint Particles, expect for Function Structures.
⬤s are used as one of the inputs for
Function Structures
.
⬤s are always leaving the swarm of Blueprint Particles behind expect the property and function ones, just to prevent the forces from colliding it.
⬤s colliding with Property Forces lead to the destruction of themselves, leaving ·s and ○s remain from the swarm of Blueprint Particles.
Structure
[
]
The vast majority of ⬤ is a void consisting of
○s
, which are the wrappers around · that prevent dangerous paradoxes from escaping or affecting any objects. The void consisting of ○ is due to reasons listed in the last sentence, as well as the fact that the · within has 0 properties. This is useful to prevent ⬤ from clogging up with many more properties than it already has.
Formation process
[
]
Phase 0
[
]
Phase 0 is the "preparation" phase for ⬤ production. This usually involves ·s colliding with each other with the end goal of having an · be embedded in another ·, although direct insertion is more reliable.
End Result:
A structure of ·s within ·s
Phase 1
[
]
Due to the structure of the targeted · from the previous step, each · will repel the other one due to the nature of paradoxes. Eventually, the outer · will become infinitely huge (relative to its original size), while the inner · will become infinitely small.
End Result:
A structure of ·s within ·s, but the outer one is increased in size infinite-fold, while the inner one is decreased in size infinite-fold
Phase 2
[
]
Extreme pressure will cause the inner · to collapse into two parts: one being containing the forces of the former ·, while the other containing the "mass" of the former ·. As a force is useless without being attached to any object, it will become a "blank force" that overrides any forces that come through it. This causes ○ to form.
End Result:
A infinite times bigger · containing an ○
Phase 3
[
]
The · and ○s will now "reproduce" and populate the to-be ⬤. However, the paradoxes will get overridden, leaving "property forces" that progressively get stronger and stronger.
Eventually, there will be enough property forces that the binding force between said forces will be strong, causing a single property to be projected onto the new ⬤.
End Result:
A ⬤
Formation of Blueprint Particles
[
]
Later, escaping property forces transformed a lot of ·s to produce the first
Property Blueprint Particles
. Other forces transformed ·s into some
Function Blueprint Particles
. They also brought ⬤s into
Function Structures
to complete the whole definition of
Blueprint Particles
(Wave, Force, Property, and Fabric), which allows those particles to make up our
Reality
.
Eventually, ⬤s will disappear from the swarm. A lot of ⬤s remain, just about 1 of 100 Blueprint Particles are ⬤s, but they are now used for one of the primary inputs of Function Structures. Unfortunately, many other ⬤s has been obliterated, which make the chaotic chain reaction between ·s and ⬤s.
Fortunately, all ⬤s from all Inanes aren't scared due to the "nothingness" property of Inane.
Million of
OYDs
after the formation of Blueprint Particles, all ·s and ⬤s will be fully transformed.
Collisions
[
]
·
○
⬤
○ (During phase 3)
Blueprint Particles
·
We already know that they produce a single ⬤.
Result: A ⬤
○
○ wraps around its inside · to prevent paradoxes from happening. When · collides with that, then the blank forces dissolve the wrapper force of ○, causing ○ to become ·. And then those particles become ⬤.
Result: A ⬤
Both ○s can't be moved freely, as they have blank forces that override perpetual motions. So, nothing happened.
Result: 2 ○s
○ (During phase 3)
During phase 3, the blank force of ○ overrides the forces of ·, including their perpetual motions.
Result: A ○ and a ·
Same result as the reaction with · instead of that ○.
Result: 2 ○s
Same result as the reaction with · instead of that ○.
Result: 2 ○s
⬤
· goes through the exterior of ⬤, but has a high chance of colliding with another ·. When this happening, the property forces turn ⬤ into a Blueprint Particle. That particle then caused that ○ to be in its own Subreality, living with a lot of other ○s.
Result: A ○ in a Subreality
It simply stops ○ by the blank forces. Those forces were property forces until ⬤ was completely formed.
Result: A ○ in a ⬤
The property forces caused a ⬤ to become a Blueprint Particle.
Result: A ○ and a Blueprint Particle
This causes the growth of ·s and ○s, producing a lot of ⬤s in result. See Phase 3 for the reason.
Result: A lot of ⬤s
Blueprint Particles
· can't be collided with Blueprint Particles, as they bounce off each other due to that Blueprint Particle being a completed one.
Result: A · and a Blueprint Particle
Same result as the reaction with · instead of that ○.
Result: A ○ and a Blueprint Particle
Same result as the reaction with · instead of that ○.
Result: A ○ and a Blueprint Particle
⬤s are one of the inputs of Function Blueprint Particles. But when that ⬤ collided with a Blueprint Particle of another kind, they bounce off.
Result: Varies
Blueprint Particles simply group up instead of getting collided.
Result: 2 Blueprint Particles
Collisions with phases 1 - 2
[
]
Phases 1 and 2 have a interesting collision, as ·s have so much pressure that it could dissolve particles quickly.
When · collides with developing ·s, · will become bigger than those ·s. When Phase 2 is done, 2 biggest ·s will become ○s, in which one ○ contains another ○. Those ○s will become infinite amount of ⬤s within a bigger ⬤, and then ⬤s will be put in a special kind of subreality called
Perareality
.
If ⬤ collides with developing ·s, extreme pressure would cause dot particles in that ⬤s will be pulled into a rift, in which they will land in a Perareality developed by those ·s.
