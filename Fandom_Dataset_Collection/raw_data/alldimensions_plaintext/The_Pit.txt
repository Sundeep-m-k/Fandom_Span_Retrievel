The
Pits
,
as their name suggest, are bottomless pits of no return. The only way to get into these verses (outside of their local
.....s
) is to tpurroc-inta the border of a
.....
using Glitchoni-transcite. Strangely, they're not black like most bottomless pits, but blue-red swirls.
The only thing at the bottom of these pits are strange verses where almost nothing exists or is able to exist.
Another very interesting thing about the Pits is that the verses at the bottom of them contains them and vice versa. One possible reason for this is because of the break of basic laws of physics and reality. Yet another interesting thing is that the verse is literally identical to the pit of a cherry, so to put it simply, this is a pit in a pit.
