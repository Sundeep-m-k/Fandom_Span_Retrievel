About
[
]
A
Boxspace
is a
void
packed (not really a void then) with many
Box
types of all sizes. Said Boxes get bigger the closer to they are to the center. 
In the exact middle of a Boxspace, a
Higher Box
that works as a core of the former can be found, and it is the section that holds the most mass out of their Boxspace.
The Boxspaces themselves do not classify as a Box, instead only being a
verse
.
Local lifeforms

As weird as this may sound like, Boxspaces frequently have
sentient
Boxes
(the ones of the
first class
) as the main
civilization
within them.
This means the borders of a Boxspace are the most advanced areas regarding their local lifeforms' intelligence and technology.
It isn't rare to see said living Boxes constantly try to get deeper into their local Boxspace. Since Boxes contain everything that exists and doesn't exist, they can use said property to artificially produce
materials
that could be helpful as gear for their fellow Boxes. Despite that, they usually get stuck around their Boxspace's section in which
2nd-class
Box types begin to appear, as they start becoming too big for the 1st-class Boxes to handle.
