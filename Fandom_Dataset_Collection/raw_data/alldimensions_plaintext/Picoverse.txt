Timeline
Formation
First ones usually form after 1 million years from formation of a Nanoverse.
Destruction
They usually destroy after 20 million years from their formation. It can also happen because of destruction events that happen in the
Nanoverses
,
Microverses
,
Milliverses
or
Universe
. They also can be destroyed because of Picoverse collision.
Lifetime
Usually ~19 million years
Picoverse
is a type of verse contained by
Nanoverses
. Like the formers, they're 2-dimensional, meaning that 3D and higher dimensional objects can't
entirely
enter or interact with these verses.
Structures
[
]
Picoverses, like
Universes
, contain star system groups, but they're not big enough to contain at least one
galaxy
. All structures inside a Picoverse are 2D, like a Nanoverse's structures. 2D
stars
,
star systems
and
planets
exist here.
Picoverse collisions
[
]
Picoverses, like Universes, can collide with eachother forming and/or destroying other Picoverses.
Soft Collisions (0.1 LY - 1 LY per second) - They form a new Picoverse. Picoverses that participated in the collision will get bounced out from it, sometimes even from it's local Nanoverse.
Hard Collisions (1 LY - 10 LY per second) - They can't form a new Picoverse, they'll only get bounced off or destroyed.
Intense Collisions (10 LY - 100 LY per second) - They destroy the Picoverses that form part in the collision.
Hyper Collisions (>100 LY per second) - Same as the former, but they can also affect nearby Picoverses in the worst case scenario.

Aw, man! Not again, it's a black hole!

Picoverse is one of the most powerful voids, because it is only 0.00001% matter, and the 'matter' is just letters. Fill in the void by
