The String
[
]
The String is the 2nd layer of The True Arena and almost the last. It contains lots of
Antiverses
that have been expanded. It is made out of Antimatter and then inside it contains Cubium (3052th element) that is a liquid. Also, there are a few
The Barrier of Realities
in there too.
The Core
[
]
The Core is A
The Barrier of Reality
covered in Criranium (4052th element) and is a liquid too. But the
Barrier
has a really strong force so it makes a
Sphere
. Other parts also hold barriers, but the middle one is where
The Bubble Blower
is and thus is more special.
