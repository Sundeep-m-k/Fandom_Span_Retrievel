Size
[
]
Size is a way to measure the actual space a verse takes up, regardless of dimensionality. There are multiple ways that size is measured, with the most common being (some number) times the size of another verse. However, there are other units that measure size, which will be listed here.
When a size is a multiple of
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
, units are usually not used, because
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
of any number of finite units is equal to
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
.
The typical measurement of size is in diameter.
However, this doesn't stop any entity from using other size measurements.
Planck Length (ℓP)
[
]
Supposedly the 'smallest length', although
there are things that are much smaller
. Equal to 1.6x10
-35
meters.
Meter (M)
[
]
A unit using the metric system, it is also 3.28084 feet.
Light-year (LY)
[
]
The distance that light travels over the course of a year. One light year is about 10
16
meters in length, or 9460730472580.8 kilometers. The
Observable Universe
is likely around 93 billions of light-years in size, and the
entire Universes
are around 600 billions of light-years, albeit increasing.
Theranit
[

Main page:
Theranit
Equal to 16,777,216 light years.
Harpameter
[
]
Main page:
Harpameter
Equal to 10
30
meters. However, it is mostly used to measure the distance between verses.
CAPSMETER
[
]
See
Best's Measurements
.
Equal to the height of the
F R I D G E
.
Gluometer
[
]
Equal to the size of the
Grand Ultimaverse
.
Dimensionality (D)
[
]
Dimensionality is a way to explain how many dimensions a verse takes up. For example, a
square
takes up 2 dimensions and has a dimensionality of 2, and a
cube
takes up 3 dimensions and therefore has a dimensionality of 3. Some verses have negative dimensionality, and many have infinite dimensionality, like
The Box
.
Dimensionality also varies in various ways. Dimensionality could be either only measured spatially or measured in multiple post-spatial dimensions. Dimensionality could also be measured by how many coordinates needed to describe a point on something's surface, or fractal dimension could be used as an alternative.
Kardashev Scale (KS)
[
]
Usually measures civilizations and how much energy they can use, where increasing the scale by 1 multiplies the energy used by 10
10
. However, when we talk about verses, it makes sense to measure the actual amount of energy and matter in a verse, and the closest approximation is that a Kardashev scale of n is
10
6
n
kg
{\textstyle 10^{6n} \text{kg}}
.

Extended Universe Size Index (EUSI)
[
]
Main page:
EUSI
Example of EUSI.
EUSI, or Extended Universe Size Index, is a way to measure how many layers of verses containing other verses there are, or 'nestings'.
EUSI is defined in the form of
ψ
(
α
,
β
,
γ
,
.
.
.
)
{\displaystyle \psi(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,...)}
, where having just
ψ
(
α
)
{\displaystyle \psi(\alpha)}
means that it just contains
α
{\displaystyle \alpha}
layers of verses, and having
ψ
(
α
,
β
,
γ
,
.
.
.
)
{\displaystyle \psi(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,...)}
means having

{\displaystyle \psi(\Omega^{\Omega^\Omega})=\psi(\Omega^{\Omega^{\psi(\Omega^{\Omega^{\psi(\Omega^{\Omega^{...}})}})}})}
, etc. where we can then extend it to very large EUSIs.
Finality Index (FI)
[
]
Main page:
Finality Index
The Finality Index is a measurement for very specific verses, and only some verses have a Finality Index. The
Omniverse
has 1-finality (contains everything that exists)
The Box
has 2-finality (contains everything that exists or doesn't exist), The Clock has 3-finality (contains everything that exists, doesn't exist, and is describable).  Further Finality Indexes have their own definitions, like
4-finality
and
ω-finality
.
