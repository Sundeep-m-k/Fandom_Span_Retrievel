The
Rockverse
is a
verse
that is almost completely solid rock and contains almost nothing but rock. This verse seems like it would be completely useless, but it is like a museum, since the rock has very cool natural crack designs.

Why does this exist?
[
]
This verse exists because space rock can sometimes fall apart. Space rock is often sticky as well. The rock fell together to make this verse. This verse stays together even though it seems like it wouldn't.
Is this actually a verse and not just a planet?
[
]
Yes. Even though it is only ten kilometers, it still has a cosmic rock web, and it has rock "planets", which are spherical.

This design is special since it is the most detailed out of all the designs. This one is near the surface of the verse, and is viewed a lot. It has a texture, unlike most other natural designs in this verse, and the feeling of it is very smooth, even though it has cracks in it.
Seematray
[

This design is special since it is the only design that is symmetrical. All of the designs are seemingly random except this one, which gives this one extra appeal and speciality. It is located near the core of the verse, but it is still popular.
Langdon
[
]
This one is different since it is in one of the orange spots of this verse. Some space rocks in this verse were stained before this verse was formed, but not many of them got designs. This orange design is the most popular because it is the closest to the surface.

Because the space rock collision wasn't perfect, there are some tunnels that you can go through. The designs are on the sides, bottom or top of these tunnels.
