The
Utilities
are the
ruling
entities
of the
mesaverse
, representing the computational power drawn by various important parts of the mesaversal infrastructure.
Tasks performed by the Utilities include allocating computational power to different
multiverses
in the mesaverse, and ensuring that crashed and malfunctioning multiverses are properly isolated and destroyed before they cause problems for other multiverses in the mesaverse. They are a thorn in the side to many growing mesaversal
civilizations
, who find that their increased use of computational power leads the Utilities to class them as a malfunction and to demand concessions.
Utilities in neighboring mesaverses in their local
xenoverse
can communicate using the
mesaversal APIs
if necessary - they have the access permissions - though generally they keep their operations independent for redundancy and because they have no motivation to communicate. As they care mostly about maintaining proper functioning of their own mesaverses, they very rarely hack into these APIs to gain more influence.
Initutilities
[
]
A subclass of Utilities, known as the
Initutilities
, are believed to handle mesaverses when they are created and destroyed, including creating the actual Utilities. Within the mesaverse, their existence is unconfirmed, though xenoversal and above civilizations can observe Initutilities in action and do employ them towards these ends.
