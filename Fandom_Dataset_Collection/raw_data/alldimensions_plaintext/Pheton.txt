Creation
[
]
Phetons are particles that bear a resemblance to photons and are generated under specific circumstances. They're a unique type of photon.
Origin
[
]
Phetons are primarily created when a photon exits a universe, and because of the law of multiversal space. It turns into a pheton.
Transformation Process
[
]
During the transformation process, the photon experiences a significant alteration in its properties. It becomes smaller in size, to the point that it's 40% smaller than an average photon's wavelength. For a few hours. During this state, it is both smaller and bigger, but it is also smaller. This state is similar to a superposition called a superradius. but different.
Differences
[
]
Phetons have multiple reasons that they are different from normal photons.
Increased Speed
[
]
One of the main differences is the speed at which Phetons travel. Phetons are exceptionally fast, moving at speeds approximately 23 times faster than the speed of light. for example
Decrease in Mass
[
]
Compared to normal photons, Phetons possess a slightly lower mass. From 0 to -0.
Reversion to Photon State
[
]
Reparation is the event in the lifecycle of a Pheton, during which it reverts to its original state as a photon. This process typically occurs when a Pheton reenters a universe.
Energy Release
[
]
When a Pheton undergoes reparation and returns to being a photon, it releases a specific type of sub-energy. This sub-energy ultimately transitions into "normal" energy.
Uses
[
]
Phetons can be useful in the grand scheme of things. because of their properties.
Observation
[
]
Because of their increased speed. They are useful for observing further objects more accurately at their current time. They also get bent less by gravity, but this doesn't mean they don't interact less than normal photons. A pheton travels 32 times faster than the speed of a photon.
