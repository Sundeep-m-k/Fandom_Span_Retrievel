Archdimensions
are seperate detached realities that can have different laws of physics. These archdimensions are present in a different metaspace called the Archdimensional Space. This metaspace between archdimensions is measured in psimis (Ψ), also known as metakilometers (Σkm). Most archdimensions have a transfinite size, but some may have a finite size. If you reach the boundary in finite archdimensions, you loop around to the other side.
