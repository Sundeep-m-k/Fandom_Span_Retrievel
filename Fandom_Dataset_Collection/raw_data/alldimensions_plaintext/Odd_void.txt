Scale
Size
112 Trigintillion LY
Properties
Temperature
12°C
Position
Contained by:
The Outer Bubble
Contains:
Hydrogen, Helium, Beryllium?
The Odd void is a large void in
The Outer Bubble
. It is one of few areas in
The Outer Bubble
to have a measured temperature, being a very pleasant 12°C. This makes the edge a very good location for any future science bases.
How or why the odd void came to be is unknown.
The amount of atoms in the odd void has been counted, coming in at 130 hydrogen atoms, 15 helium, and possibly 2 beryllium atoms.
