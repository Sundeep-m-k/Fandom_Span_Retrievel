Amoneverse
is a verse, where everything, that goes in, is rotated 180 degrees, like directions and position.
If you were to try to touch this, you would have your finger appear at the other side of the verse, reversed, except it wouldn't be physically inverted, only visually so.
This verse is called the Amenoverse and not something like 180verse or Mirrorverse, because the property of visually flipping anything outside of it, is just that, a small unimportant property that this verse has. This verse has civilizations, structures, laws and everything. It mirror property is not its defining quality.
