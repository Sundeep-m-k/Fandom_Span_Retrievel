These are the building blocks of
Protoparticles
and have only been observed on a few occasions. These particles are extremely small and if you assemble these particles the wrong way they may make massive explosions. These particles, while small, can be used to build very strong stuff like a house or a wall or something. The reason why is because these particles are very very strong and as such can only be broken by something like a god on the scale of
the Donut God
. That's basically all there is to say about these tiny things.
