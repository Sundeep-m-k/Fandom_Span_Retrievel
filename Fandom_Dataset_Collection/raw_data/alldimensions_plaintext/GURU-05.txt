GURU-05 is the 5th
universe
discovered by GURU. It is the third closest neighbor, along with this it is a C type universe, meaning it had a larger big bang then most other universes, although it didnâ€™t really have a big bang like others, as it collided with many other debris which helped increase its size when forming. GURU-05 is the largest universe to ever be discovered and it is many times bigger then our own. GURU-05 is also known for being surprisingly large for a C type even though the typical largest universe types are D types.
History
[
]
Formation (2 trillion BC - 1.5 trillion BC)
[
]
During this era (about 2 trillion years ago) GURU-05 was forming but in a much different way, as it was collecting trans dimensional minerals and eventually collided with multiple other universes, but due to the sheer tempature of the forming multiple GURU-05 did not cause any worm holes as they instantly were melted shut if they did form.
Cooling (1.5 trillion BC - 1 trillion BC)
[
]
During this time, GURU-05 was cooling down to a colder temperatures from a Temperature so hot it would melt anything in a meter picosecond to about room temperature) this era was also the formation of asteroids and small rocks, and the start of the smallest stars.
Gloomy Age (1 trillion BC - 0.6 trillion BC)
[
]
The first stars began forming and galaxies began coming together, the edges of the universe pulled rocks away from each other for a long time until internal expansion eventually allowed rocks to form together eventually in the next age, this age was important yet lifeless.
Prehistorical Age (0.6 trillion BC - 0.5 trillion bc)
[
]
Life starts to form but only bacterial form at here.
Modern Age (0.5 trillion BC - 2024)
[
]
Life finally began forming and galaxies were everywhere, this is what the universe looks like today and has shown quick advances in the modern day.
