Primordium Theta is most likely the strangest  of all. P. Theta has different properties based on the container it was originally formed in, and this
cannot
be changed by the work of even the most complex and large
Macroformers
. Multiplying them will not change their properties if they were formed in a verse outside their "parent" particle's. In our
Universe
, putting it on something would lessen the temperature by 0.07 degrees F per pound of P. Theta, no matter the size, however there is only one particle of it found so far in said Universe, and on average there are 0.46 per Universe in our Multiverse. The amount per Universe varies, but is only seen as high as 2 in the largest of containers with the most Primordium Theta. It does have basic properties like mass, dimensions, and a part in time. It doesn't affect much else aside from these basic and specific properties. It is much more useful in
Mimic Matter
.
In different verses, Primordium Theta can:
Create blueprint particles randomly
Increase gravity-mass ratio of an object
Split molecules within a certain radius
and up to 14,560 others.
The particles it forms out of itself can take on different roles, with the same logic as the regular ones. These are called Primordium Theta B. particles, and form out of 2 Primordium Theta particles occasionally (if their properties don't repel each other and they originate in the same body)
Footnote: Naming
[
]
Although Primordium Theta takes up the name of a Primordium particle, Theta is an example of a misnomer. It is not exactly a fundamental building block of reality like the other particles, and has been noted as having specific and non-essential properties. The reason behind the name is that the mass of a Theta particle is remarkably similar to that of a proper Primordium particle, and its properties at the time were considered similar to proper Primordium substances. Most experts agree today that there's no going back now.
