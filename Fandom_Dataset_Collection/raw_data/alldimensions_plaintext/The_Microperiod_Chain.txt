This is a list of nonexistent "periods" that were created by ICantEdit (mostly) and Space-Lover (somewhat). Each period defies logic, acts strange, and is just plain weird. Each period has a short description made by an equally weird and strange person. The "bigger" periods are at the top, and the "smaller" periods are at the bottom.

Microperiod
"Why are you here? What have you come here for? There is nothing here. It's just a period. A nonexistent one. That's it. Currently,
no one
SOMEONE has discovered something smaller,
since this thing technically doesn't exist, and logic is already gone
. Why is everything in italics?"
Nanoperiod
"Is it really possible? It's a period, that's smaller than a nonexistent period (Microperiod)that doesn't even obey any forms of logic, and we call it a 'nanoperiod'. We couldn't get any more unoriginal. But that's ok, since this wiki allows unoriginal things. Just don't overdo it."
Picoperiod
"Oh ok. Now there's a thing called 'Picoperiod'. Isn't that interesting? It's contained by a nonexistent, logic-defying period that's also contained by an 'even larger' nonexistent logic-defying period. We are going to get into some serious deja vu here."
Femtoperiod
"What am I even doing? More periods? I should put all of these into one page."
Yesperiod
why.
