Quantum Particles
The Pushverse is a peculiar verse found in a
Metaverse
that has a force known as "reverse-gravity". This reverse-gravity, instead of pulling things together, pushes them outward. Due to this verse also having no gravity, all that exists inside this verse are tiny quantum particles.
Reverse-gravity's properties also apply to even electromagnetic waves, radiation, or literally ANYTHING. Due to this, having senses in this verse is utterly useless due to the no form of wavelength or matter being able to come into contact with you.
Structure
[
]
The Pushverse, since there is no gravity to hold the verse together to stop it from having its contents spread over the place, has an undefined size and shape due to the Pushverse's contents being very unclear. It is generally agreed upon that the Pushverse is 10,000,000 LY in diameter, although the volume and even area is unclear.
The Pushverse's inner contents aren't very interesting. All that is there are quantum particles which just constantly move all over the place and hop out of existence.
QBLs
[
]
This is where it gets interesting. The Pushverse has life somehow. This "life" is composed of trillions of the quantum particles that can "communicate" with each other by switching
existence ranks
from 1 to 0. These quantum particles act like logic gates, which is how the life is "living" in a way. This life, nicknamed QBL (Quantum Binary Life) is extremely basic, with no need for any sort of food, water, or nutrients. QBLs have no senses, and thus cannot communicate with other lifeforms.
