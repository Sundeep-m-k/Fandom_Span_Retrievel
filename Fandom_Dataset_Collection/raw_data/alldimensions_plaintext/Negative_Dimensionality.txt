Negative First Dimension
[
]
On negative first dimension, there is no point on this space.
In abstract polytopes, the -1D shape is the null polytope; this is a consequence of abstract polytopes also being sets since the null polytope corresponds to the empty set.
Negative Second and other Dimensions
[
]
In the negative second dimension, there exists the -2D shape of the Dinull polytope.  It has little physical meaning, even in the realm of abstract polytopes, but does show up in some places, such as in Cinioveres. Its strange null abstract shit. imagine that -1d is nothing, but something. But -2d, -3d, 4d looks the same, but it's smaller.
negative infinity dimension

abstract things have become so strong that it cannot be described in words. They are REALLY small. It makes you die of shock if it is detected, but it is almost undetectable. there are already differences between measurements.
Imaginary dimension

why. their dimension is really IMAGINARY. it is not there, but it is there. it's like -1d but less. And it seems bigger than -2d.
