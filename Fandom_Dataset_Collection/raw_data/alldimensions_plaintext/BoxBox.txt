how it works
[
]
the boxbox chain is simple.
B is the number of boxes in the boxbox chain
each boxbox is B times the size of the last box and +1 the dimensionality of the last box
and B is a very big number that cant even be written
each boxbox contains the previous boxbox in the chain
boxboxes have a simple naming system:
the smallest boxbox has a ID of 1, so it is named Boxbox-1
for every containing boxbox, it is 1 + the previous boxbox name
Boxbox3 contains boxbox2 which contains boxbox1.
that was an example.
