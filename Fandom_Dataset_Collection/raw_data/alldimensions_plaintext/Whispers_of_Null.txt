Of all the enigmas of the
multiverse
, the
Whispers of Null
are among the most horrifying.
The
Whispers of Null
are abstract entities with no shape or form, that come from a realm known as the
Kingdom of Null
, which is located in the Multiverse Void, the void between all
universes
in the
multiverse
. The Whispers of Null are incredibly unpredictable.
Due to not having a physical form, Whispers are generally extremely difficult to fend off, let alone kill. Their true form cannot be possibly described by any entity in the
multiverse
. Whispers have the ability to take control over an entity's thoughts, inserting new ones into their consciousness. By putting the entity in its weakest mental state, Whispers are effortlessly able to command the entity to do whatever it desires.
Kingdom of Null
[
]
The Kingdom of Null represents the void itself. When Whispers are born, their souls become eternally tied to the Kingdom, as they are created directly from the void. Naturally, when Whispers die, their souls return to the heart of the Kingdom, ready to reincarnate as a new Whisper. The more Whispers there are, the more control the Kingdom has over the
multiverse
.
The
Null King
is the supreme ruler of the Kingdom of Null, and is the most powerful Whisper in the
multiverse
. Unlike other Whispers, the Null King can create a physical manifestation of itself. If an entity kills the current Null King, that entity will gain its powers and assume the title as the new Null King, turning into a Whisper in the process. The new Null King will continue to rule over the Kingdom of Null.
Reproduction
[
]
The Whisper's main objective is to reproduce, increasing the Kingdom of Null's power over the
multiverse
. Essentially, the final goal is to overwhelm the multiverse through sheer numbers, making it all part of the Kingdom of Null.
Whispers attack nearby entities by first taking control over the entity's consciousness, using it to lure the entity towards the void. Whispers are most powerful when they are nearby the void. Once the entity enters the void, the Whisper can easily kill it. If the entity still proves to be too powerful for the lone Whisper, it will begin screaming loudly. This sharp sound, called the
Null Scream
, not only momentarily paralyzes the entity by shutting down its stream of consciousness, but it also serves as a call for backup. Once more Whispers appear, it is nearly impossible for the entity to fight back.
When killed, the entity is converted into another Whisper, and its soul becomes tied to the Kingdom. The Kingdom's collective power, as a result, is increased. This process continues for eternity, until eventually, the entire
multiverse
is consumed by the void.
