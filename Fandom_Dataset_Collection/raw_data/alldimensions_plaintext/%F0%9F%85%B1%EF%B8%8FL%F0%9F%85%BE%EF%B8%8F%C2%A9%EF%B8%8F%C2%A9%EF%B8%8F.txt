The 🅱️L🅾️©️©️ is a cube with a side length of 1 meter. The interesting thing about the 🅱️L🅾️©️©️ is that it contains entire nested realities inside of it that are only accessible by shrinking down. Inside of these realities, there are entire structures, creatures and civilisations that have developed inside of it.
How it works

How it works basically
Basically, when you shrink down, the 🅱️L🅾️©️©️ gains more detail, being made of more blocks. All of these blocks have more blocks and other things when you shrink down to their level down for them to gain more detail. Basically it's fractal block world (theres a link to the wiki there but it only shows up in editor mode. my guess as to why is because fandom is salty that i'm linking to wiki.gg. whatever).
