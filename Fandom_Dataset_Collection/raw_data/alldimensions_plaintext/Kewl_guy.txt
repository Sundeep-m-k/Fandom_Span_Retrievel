Beings, realms, overly mutated things that ascend every possible dimension or type of universe possible. That is just how everything is.. usually I think. One day a universe has a stronger being then everything, next day something else stronger. But in the midst of all the chaos, all the universes, and everything.
He
stands out. Name him
kewl guy
I suppose, purposefully spelled as such. Why does this figure matter you suppose? It is a true shitpost is the most plausible answer by an
unknown
thing.
The most mortal yet non-mortal. Attributed with pureblood mortality, not one power, not one genetic enhancement even, just pure mortal out of these infinite places that just everything is a super cosmic being.
kewl guy
exists as the most nonchalant and blank being known to everything. Burn a city infront of the guy, for some reason he just care. Proclaim him into infinite suffering, he just doesn't care at all. An omniversal being ready to kill everything, he just doesn't care. You have an all-powerful omnipotent omniscient unbeatable regenerative property being that has pure creation powers of omniverses and able to erase omniverses just as easily?
kewl guy
just doesn't care at all.
Maybe, it was contradictory about his 'pureblood mortal' thingy that he just doesn't die oddly. It is more of like a spacetime anomaly you can describe it. When a universe and all its beings and matter is destroyed, he just stands there and transported into another realm. And neither does this effect
kewl guy
at all obviously. His anomaly was present from around a few billion years ago (age of
kewl guy
basically) and yet he doesn't have any powers, this solidifying his mostly pureblood mortality. You can infinitely
try
to kill him. Killing
kewl guy
won't change the fate of everything as you know it if you somehow kill him. More of as a nuisance to gods who try to kill him. Generally, for some reason a few spent a thousand years trying to kill this immortal, mortal being and yet nothing worked and most that can be described as
kewl guy
blinked at him twice and spoke,
"can you leave me alone for a second bruh"
possessing a strong conscious state. Very rarely, a strange ripple can occur during transport that makes
kewl guy
gain random stuff from universes. Once he somehow had a waterbending scroll from Avatar, just very strange and random to say the least. The items are generally random and occur at an estimated 0.682%~ said by
kewl guy
in a possible interview. It worked well and he might've screwed up a timeline and destroyed his universe before being transported losing the scroll which made him sad but instantly recovered. Tracking down
kewl guy
is like finding a specific blade of grass... in the Earth itself. You just won't find him for pretty much forever without the strongest Kardashev level gear for tracking. One though came to mind though is what if one used the blood or energy in
kewl guy
for science or achieving immortality without dying to a god? Really enough doesn't work and it gets rejected and blows the entire system up simply enough. No complexity and stuff, it just always blows up. And he doesn't care the entire process, only caring during one test,
"brotha, may i get some
oats
Choco milk"
very oddly.
Whatever his properties had derived from sourced from a very very ancient being that cursed him to this pitless suffering. Although for the first half he was in purely shitting his pants, later on in time (within a few hundred years) he just didn't care and slowly and slowly became more and more nonchalant, not caring on what me his way. First experiences are equal to the new experiences, just pure pithell torture from different beings. Infinitely being isekai'd through life, and the stoppage point of this constant warping to new universes WILL end once EVERY universe has a true stoppage and no more can be made throughout the Allsphere. When will this happen? No idea, making
kewl guy
one of the strongest semi-immortal beings ever as he can always have a new place to live in without treacherous treks through new places. Long aged the ancient being is, sorrowfully cannot revert his changes to
kewl guy
. Many, many beings aside from experimental mortals or wizards tried to extract his immortality as a way to become the strongest thing ever with no end, omnipotent, universal, alot of things in a few billion years. But oh, the obvious it never worked, and they just couldn't extract it at all strangely. Though he could feel all the pain coursing through so many things,
kewl guy
sat blanky at these attempts and wanted to just chill for a second,
aside from a weird, weird observation very small but unnoticeable disliking to female distinguished beings.
It was called out to
kewl guy
once by a random universe... and he just shrugged and denied it. -
"nuh uh i didn't your faking fr fr".
Just another thing is that he is an idiot without many thoughts in what he says and severely brainrotted possibly.
