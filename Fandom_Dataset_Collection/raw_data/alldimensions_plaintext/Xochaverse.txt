The
Xochaverse
(formerly known as the
Masbraverse
) (pronounced zah-cuh-verse) is a huge verse that is home to some cosmic beings, called the Ultima Capybaras. These beings inhabit the Masbraverse, and have an absolutely humongous lifespan, living for a whopping 10↑

10 OYC. The Ultima Capybaras look exactly like earth capybaras, however they are absolutely HUGE (you were totally expecting that didn't you) and sapient.
Ultima Capybaras are also social creatures and live in
literally humongous
floating cities. As of now, there are currently about 83 tredecillion cities in the Masbraverse.
The
Xochaverse
is also ruled over by
Ychievquurtixchra
and
Chunky Cheese
because of multiple occasions where
Avi
destroyed large parts of the verse.
