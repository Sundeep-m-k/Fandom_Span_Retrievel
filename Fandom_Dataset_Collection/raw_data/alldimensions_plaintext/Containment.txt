Figure 1:
Showing full, proper containment.
Figure 2:
Shows how  a verse of a smaller dimension can not fully contain a verse of a higher dimension,
Figure 3:
Not very clear, but if a lower dimensional verse is wrapped around a higher dimensional verse, it does not contain it but, but merely has the blue verse located in its geometrical center.
Figure 4:
Blue verse's area of influence extends out slightly beyond the red verse, and as such is not properly contained by the red verse.
Containment
is a concept referring to the ability of one object
B
to hold all of object
A
's contents and more. In other words,
A
⊆
B
{\displaystyle  A \subseteq B}
is equivalent to
∀
x
(
x
⊆
A
⟹
x
⊆
B
)
.
{\displaystyle \forall x \left(x \subseteq A \implies x \subseteq B\right).}

Definition

Verse
A
{\displaystyle A}
is contained inside of verse
B
{\displaystyle B}
, if the set of all information of
A
{\displaystyle A}
includes all information from the set of
B
{\displaystyle B}
.
A
∩
B
=
A
{\displaystyle A\cap B=A}
This rule takes advantage of the fact that laws map all information inside of the area of space they are inscribed in, which means that laws of
B
{\displaystyle B}
influence
all information from
A
{\displaystyle A}
, giving us an alternative definition to
containment
. This only works if
B
{\displaystyle B}
has laws and is used for objects that aren’t obvious if they are contained by
B
{\displaystyle B}
.
A
{\displaystyle A}
is partially contained in
B
{\displaystyle B}
if
A
∩
B
⊈
{
∅
,
A
}
{\displaystyle A\cap B\nsubseteq\{\varnothing ,A\}}
.
Such a precise definition of
containment
is not needed in typical cases of
A
{\displaystyle A}
and
B
{\displaystyle B}
, but is needed when one can not directly observe
containment
between
A
{\displaystyle A}
and
B
{\displaystyle B}
and must use limited information.
A
{\displaystyle A}
is not contained in
B
{\displaystyle B}
if
A
∩
B
=
∅
{\displaystyle A \cap B = \varnothing}
.
When
A
{\displaystyle A}
’s area of influence reaches
beyond
B
{\displaystyle B}
,
A
{\displaystyle A}
is mostly contained in
B
{\displaystyle B}
. However, if both
A
{\displaystyle A}
and its area of influence is contained in
B
{\displaystyle B}
,
A
{\displaystyle A}
is properly contained in
B
{\displaystyle B}
(properly contained and contained have the same definition, properly contained is just more specific and used in more technical matters).
A verse that is lower
dimensional
than another verse can not contain said verse, as it is impossible, for example, a
plane
to contain a
sphere
.

Hierarchies
[
]
In
Hypercosmology
, a containment hierarchy describes a set
H
{\displaystyle H}
defined as the following:
∀
x
∈
H
∃
y
∈
H
(
x
∈
y
∨
y
∈
x
)
{\displaystyle \forall x\in H\exists y\in H(x\in y\lor y\in x)}
∀
x
∈
H
∀
y
∈
H
(
x
⊆
y
∨
y
⊆
x
∨
x
=
y
)
{\displaystyle \forall x\in H\forall y\in H(x\subseteq y\lor y\subseteq x\lor x=y)}
A hierarchy can be based on any object, such as a
Universe
; examples include
The Official Hierarchy
,
The Extended Hierarchy
,
The Post-Hierarchy
, and
The Pre-Hierarchy
.
EUSI
[

A verse's containment depth with respect to the
Universe
can be measured in the
EUSI
scale. EUSI describes a transfinite containment depth with
Velben Notation
.
