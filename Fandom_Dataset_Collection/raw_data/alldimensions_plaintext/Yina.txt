Facts
Yina
[
]
Yinas
are very structured
verses
. Inside of them, a core surrounding a
Next
can be found, which is also surrounded by
Theta Structures
that make a web-like structure.
Layers
[
]
There are many layers of
Theta Structures
that make the webs within Yinas, but the more in you go, you can see some Nexts floating around. Those are the black blobs there that also control gravity in this verse. However, each black blob is far, FAR more than just one next, as the GIF is of all of a Yina. The further inside, the greater the good energy
Good Energy
[
]
Yinas are home to all good energy within both themselves and lower verses they contain, and any
cosmic entities
within a Yina reflect this truth.
The energy is harvested by the clouds of Yoolith in order to spread goodness around all of existence. Entities near the core can never have evil affect them again (unless they travel to the near-core area of their local
Yanga
).
A Yina's core, oddly similar to a
Bond
appearance-wise.
Facts

The core actually controls most of the gravity of these verses.
There are parts that do lead you to the Yina's cores.
These are source of creation of light, meaning that they makes all of their local light in existence.
Yinas are orb that controls a bit of space and time (e.g: when you are in this verse, time usually is a lot slower but some times a lot faster).
