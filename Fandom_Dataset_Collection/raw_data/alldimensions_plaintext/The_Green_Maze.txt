The
Green Mazes
are the second type of
colored
mazes
, after
the Purple Mazes
and behind
the blue
ones.
They're the only maze-type to have
rogue
planets
on them which all have an excessive amount of
elements
which when hit by light are reflected as
green
(hence the green color scheme of the mazes).
Most intelligent
life
sees the Green Mazes as huge farms on the outside, with their insides being filled with Purple Mazes. While still being made of calcium, traces of condensed matter with the same green element have also been found in the shells, and a lack of a large heartbeat un√±ike their purple counterparts.
