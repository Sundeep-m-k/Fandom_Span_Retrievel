Vebolntum
are pseudoparticles that are contained inside of
Opuli
, typically at the center, but rarely contained at their edge.
These pseudoparticles are the largest of their type, which are basically a group of objects that are pre-particles but act as if they were particles. Despite being at such a small level that they are no longer affected by either magnetism or gravity, they still have both gravitational and magnetic fields, which aren't really those fields, but they act in similar ways. These are called pseudofields.
The vebolntum actually has some effective mass, being able to attract other pseudoparticles using its pseudofields. Vebolntum can pass through opuli, and if a vebolntum passes through its parent opulum, it will cause the opulum to burst, releasing very dangerous fragments. These fragments are safe to anything smaller than a
Yarron
, but very dangerous to larger entities.
If two vebolntum are in the same opulum, it will cause the vebolntum to get attracted to eachother and "inflate" the opulum, making it grow in size. The vebolntum will be merged and push on the edges of the opulum, making it unstable and extremely dangerous.
