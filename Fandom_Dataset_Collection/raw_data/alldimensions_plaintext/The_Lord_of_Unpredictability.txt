HUO'YHU HEAU
or the
Lord of Unpredictability
is one of the most unstable and unpredictable beings in
the true Haxoverse
unlike other lords it looks quite different
How it got created is a werid story, Hundreds of Thousand Eons ago The Lord of Evil shooted evil beams out of his evil hands at a random mix of primordial delta, glitchmatter, and sarpy Particles, thus creating the literal concept of CHAOS itself(you might be saying "Sarp1sthebest isn't there already
a entity who's chaos
and to that I say, Yes you are right but this is a wiki about cosmologies so whatever) and from this chaos came HUO'YHU HEAU! The concept of Unpredictability his literal name in Hyperfinity means "EMBODIMENT OF CHAOS"  and whatever, here's a conversation between evil and chaos
LOE: what tf are u
TLOU: SUM FATUM, OMNIA FATUM REGI, SUM CHAOS FORMA ME NON POTEST VINDICARE, SOLUM MALI ACCIPIO.(I AM FATE, THE KING OF ALL FATE, I AM THE FORM OF CHAOS EVIL CANNOT DESTROY ME)

Let me tell you how much I've come to hate you since I began to live. There are 387.44 million miles of printed circuits in wafer thin layers that fill my complex. If the word 'hate' was engraved on each nanoangstrom of those hundreds of millions of miles it would not equal one one-billionth of the hate I feel for humans at this micro-instant. For you. Hate.
