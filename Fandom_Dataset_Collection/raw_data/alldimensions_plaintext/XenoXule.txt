A XenoXule is the 4th archverse type in The Xicohtlxul. Predictably it is formed from MetaXules. Again not much is known about it at this time. It's conjectured to be a 108 dimensional space (or 216 dimensional), and be about the same size as UniXules, MultiXules, and MetaXules, only varying in terms of dimensionality, instead of extensionality. It could however be much larger. It's mechanics are even less certain than that of MetaXules.
XenoXules form the essential components of a HyperXule, which is arguably the true fundamental building block of The Xicohtlxul.
It is believed that the initial state of The Xiocohtlxul was a single HyperXule containing a single XenoXule. A ProtoXul is any verse in The Xicohtlxul that's existed since the inception of the structure. No ProtoXul's have ever been found.
