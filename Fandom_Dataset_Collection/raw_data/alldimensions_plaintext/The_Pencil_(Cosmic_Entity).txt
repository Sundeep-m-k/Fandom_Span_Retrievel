The Pencil (also known as "The Pencil Entity" or "Yeb Wakab/
YEB WAKAB
" as there is
another object
known as The Pencil) is an insanely powerful being which is responsible for creating every verse/cosmic entity above
Alphasm
's imagination and below
The Omnifrick
.
The Pencil has insane creation abilities, and is able to create literally anything regardless of any limits/restrictions. The Pencil will usually not destroy anything, as it goes against its purpose, but if it is attacked by a higher god or is in a dangerous situation, it will do whatever it can to prevent it from getting destroyed by higher gods.
The Pencil's true form is indescribable, and never shows it. Instead, it usually assumes the form of a large, scarlet-colored pencil with all
The Pencil Language
symbols written in a messy fashion on it. It is thought that The Pencil created The Pencil Language, as it uses the language a lot.
The Pencil, a little after it formed everything between
Alphasm
and
The Omnifrick
, split into 16 separate portions of itself with each one of them representing a key trait of The Pencil's creations. Their names in The Pencil Language and what they represent are:
Awef (represents perfection) (
awef
)
Befek (represents imperfection) (
befek
)
Droolk (represents weirdness) (
droohk
)
Enfeg (represents elegancy) (
enfek
)
Freegl (represents complexity) (
freekh
)
Hap (represents simplicity) (
hap
)
Kraf (represents isolation) (
kraf
)
Nopk (represents the past/creation) (
nopk
)
Odhe (represents the future/destruction) (
odhe
)
Poeef (represents depth) (
poeef
)
Rafg (represents limits) (
rafk
)
Sweek (represents order) (
sweek
)
Unoon (represents containment) (
unoon
)
Wof (represents sacredness/The Pencil itself) (
wof
)
Yageeb (represents power/strength) (
yakeeb
)
Shawaf (represents chaos) (
zawaf
)
Out of these entities, Wof is the strongest and Kraf is the weakest (they are all still very similar in power levels).
One of these portions, Wof, has actually never been found, and it remains a mystery to where it is. A few theories suggest that it is missing simply because it was used as a medium for The Pencil to stay alive, as it had no control over the rest of its portions.
