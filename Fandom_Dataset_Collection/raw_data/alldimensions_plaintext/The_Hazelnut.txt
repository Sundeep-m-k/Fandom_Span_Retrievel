"To crack the uncrackable 'nuts' [sic]
[

]
, one must find the nuts [sic] that exist and can be cracked. To this end, I present The most 'Nuts' structure of them all, The Hazelnut. A Hazelnut is a structure in which there is one central cosmic structure, referred to as the 'Chestnut', and all structures surrounding the Chestnut are copies of the chestnut called 'almonds' that diverge very little from the original. However, every structure surrounding the first copies diverge minorly from the copy, and so on. The
order
of an almond is defined as 1 + the order of the Nut that the almond mimics, with the Chestnut being of order 0. As the order approaches infinity, the Almonds become so distorted from the original that they are nearly impossible to pass through without suffering damage from incompatible physics with that of the Chestnut or outside of the Hazelnut. This outer layer is known as the 'Shell' of the Hazelnut."

Structure
[
]
All Almonds of the same order do not necessarily diverge from the previous order almonds in the same way, however, all Almonds that diverge in the same way are always clustered into structures known as
Walnuts
. The Chestnut has been observed to exert some type of force on space around it, and this force has been theorized as causing the Hazelnut to form. All known Hazelnuts have had a fully formed Shell on discovery.
Evidence
[
]
Many
Fricknias
have Hazelnut structure, with each
Fricksville
being a Walnut and the Chestnut being a
Downtown Fricksville
. The Hazelnut structure has been observed in all
Types of spaces
, and has been found to occur most often in Vsauian space. Hazelnut structure has also been observed in the imagination of
Alphasm
, although extremely rarely, and all observed occurrences happened in a Fricknia that was itself of Hazelnut structure. The occurence of Hazelnuts inside the imagination of Alphasms has been questioned, with researchers noting that these Hazelnuts are not completely consistent in formation with those that exist outside of Alphasm's imagination. For this reason, evidence pertaining to Hazelnuts in Alphasm's imagination are usually not considered conclusive. Attempts to artificially create a Hazelnut have been attempted, but never have succeeded.

Rayiht called The Hazelnut was called a "Misugk jer≈àahw" (EN /'Mi.souk 'je í.na/ Raztl√´ ['mi.sox 'jerÃù.≈ã…ë ç]), which translates roughly to "Primordial Structure". Rayiht theorized that Hazelnuts were the first or one of the first structures that existed. As evidence to this, they note that no verses in
The Traditional Hierarchy of Verses
have Hazelnut structure. Building from Rayiht's theory, other scientists have theorized that a Hazelnut is the "simplest unique infinite verse". The idea of the "simplest unique infinite verse" is that a Hazelnut of infinite size could be simulated using only a true random number generator and an elementary particle, and that this Hazelnut would not exist anywhere in existence. Because of this, the Hazelnut is often used as a model in studies of infinite cosmology.
