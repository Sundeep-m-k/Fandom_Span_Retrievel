The Imaginary-verse is an imaginary-sized verse which contains many of the things normal Universes do, such as planets, stars, galaxies, etc. It also has imaginary dimensionality and imaginary Kardashev Scale as well. It has the appearance of a blue-purple fractal similar to the Mandelbrot set on the outside. The Imaginary-verse is contained by the
Imaginarium
. Some of of the Imaginary-verse's planets (and moons) have hypercrystals.

Some hypercrystals.
Hypercrystals are crystals that can be found on planets and moons on the Imaginary-verse. They are also able to be created artificially. Like the Imaginary-verse, hypercrystals are imaginary in size and dimensionality.
Timeline
[
]
Hypercrystals were first artificially created by scentists in the year 6,809. The chunk created weighed about 2 picograms imaginary (ipg). At this point, the price of hypercrystals is $14 undecilion/ipg.
In 7,089 scientists created 1 gram imaginary (ig) of this material. At this point, hypercrystals cost $156 octillion/ig.
In 10,251, hypercrystals were beginning to be mass-produced and they were becoming more common. At this point, hypercrystals only cost $12/iG. Scientists also created a bomb out of hypercrystals.
In 12,812, the Big Kaltianam disaster happens.
Hypercrystal Bomb
[
]
The hypercrystal bomb is a nuke-like bomb made out of hypercrystals. They usually have an explosion force of at least 50 ikT (kilotons imaginary) of TNT. They can also send things in a large radius to the Imaginary-verse. How the teleportation happens is currently classified.
The Big Kaltianam Disaster
[
]
In 12,812, a large city by the name of Big Kaltianam was sent to the Imaginary-verse after the accidental detonation of a hypercrystal bomb. Upon later exploration of the Imaginary-verse, the entire city was discovered on a moon with everyone who was in the city at the time being dead. The crater left behind was covered in hypercrystal residue, which was collected for further studying. The area which once held Big Kaltianam is now officially marked as a deadzone, with no one except authorized personnel being allowed in the area. This is due to things in the area randomly getting transported to the Imaginary-verse.
