History

The
Hchezics
are very mysterious as they didn't write down anything. We do know a list of rulers though coins and rough dates.

After this no coins were found, but some structures still remain.
During the reign of Jgep-Konrtibn the Hchezics were making art - something that they don't do during any other time. It is theorized that they did make art but destroyed it all in an attempt to survive, using it for valuable materials, but the art made during the period of Jgep-Konrtibn wasn't found or when they were found, they didn't destroy them, as they depicted kings as gods, so they thought they were gods. Historians side with the latter.
We have no idea why Herthyius and Justlyuis ruled at the same time.
Religion
[
]
Late Hchezics worshipped 56 of what they call "void lords". They worshiped them in the
Alebo-Ashewan
realm. We only know 8 of their names: Zjanfua, Otknuxi, Sylioq, Lggmotu, Jbefinisspinhsa, Setcwec, Hehyub and Primbiklh.
Konrtibn, Rathjau, and Jgep are notable previous kings mostly confirming the "god" theory on why their art survived. Some historians think they were gods and they just made coins out of them as gods, and Herthyius and Justlyuis were also gods so that both their coins were made at the same time.
