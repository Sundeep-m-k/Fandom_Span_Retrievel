Hi! I’m the creator of these numbers, Gavinnusz! All these numbers are fictional and the equations are also, and we will be going in size order.

Yt” - Yocto’s number
[

Yt” is considered to be the closest number to 0, being 0.00000000000… {0x finity}…00001  (finity is the closest number to infinity) if you put the number in real life, it would only be able to contain 5
Protoverse’s
and since 1/ ∞ = 0, then this is the closest number to 0, ever!
There are 3 to make these numbers, simple, modern, and complex (none of this math is real BTW)
Simple
[
]
Get a 1 and divide it by finity
Modern
[
]
get a 0.1 and add 1,000,000 zeros between “.” And “1”, we will call this S, and do this, S/S/S/S/S… {SxSxSxSxS… {SxTREE(3)} = 1/ ∞ and then divide 1/ ∞ by 5 getting Yt”
Complex

lets say 1 is X, X/8 x 16 = 2, which we will call Y. X/Y/Y/Y/Y/Y… {Y = 100} witch we will call D, and the equation we will call Z, Z/D/D/D/D/D.… {DxD}, we will call that V, V/1,000,000 = F F/1,000,000 witch equals T.
and repeat the process T more times. And we will call this process, S, do that process S times more. And we will call that R. once again, repeat that process R more times, and repeat that R more times, and repeat that G(64) more times. To finally create Yt”
