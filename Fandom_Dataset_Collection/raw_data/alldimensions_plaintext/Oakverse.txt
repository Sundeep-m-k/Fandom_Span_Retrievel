The
Oakverse
is a structure made by unknown creatures attempting to control the
Quod Transfinita
, it contains the Quod Transfinita projected as a hologram on its center. Excluding all previous verses inside of it, it has a population of 124,000 (mostly workers who ensure the verse doesn't contract into Quod Transfinita).
While the creatures were constructing the Oakverse, one of their tools spawned in several larger verses by accident, like the
Oakmultiverse
and
Hentexa
.
