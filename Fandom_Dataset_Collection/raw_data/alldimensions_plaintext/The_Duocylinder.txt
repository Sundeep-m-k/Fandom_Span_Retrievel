The
Duocylinder
is a verse that is shaped like the
shape of the same name
, which is the
Cartesian product
of two
circles
. It is made of
Cubinders
, and slowly rotates in four dimensions. Like
The Tesseract
and
The Cubinder
, most of the verse is just void and a barrier but the most interesting part is the part shaped like a duocylinder.

Construction
[
]
Like the previous verses, The Duocylinder is constructed from many
Archrealities
on top of one another. The number of layers in The Duocylinder is actually
Ω
2
{\displaystyle \Omega_2}
, or in other words, The Duocylinder can be described as
R
The Cubinder
Ω
2
{\displaystyle R^{\Omega_2}_\text{The Cubinder}}
