Fake Networkverse Hypercontainers
are abstract containers where all the
FNSs
which are related to others are here. They are very advanced and even have something so meta. The little boxes inside are just FNSs and they represent the related container of Fake Networkverses. Because of the mass connection with many others, they became virtual.

FNHs have less connections (or the connections are further away) than FNSs and especially
FNCs
since FNHs are bigger and contain more
Fake Networkverses
which are related. But still
FNUs
actually are the least connected (the most separated) verses in
Fake Wikiverse Chain
as it contains every single FNs of the similar kind. FNHs are very bright, as much as
‽
⫚ luxes. So luminous you could use them to light the entire FNU. It is messy inside but all of the little boxes are actually FNSs. They are also more disconnected with others. FNHs are self-contained, too. Most of the voids are just empty placements for creation of more Fake Networkverse Superclusters, so this makes them self-contained.
Timeline
[
]
Fake Networkverse Hypercontainers are formed when many Fake Networkverse Supercontainers are joined to form a larger container. And they are connected to make their FNH better. Also to add more content inside the FNH.
At
⫚
⫚
BOYC
, the first Fake Networkverse Hypercontainer was formed. It doesn't had as much content as it is today. It is a primordial FNH that's still is surviving. That FNH is ours, and contains only Fake Networkverses before they formed FNCs and FNSs.
At
⩸
⫚ BOYC, since there's more FNHs, our FNU was formed.
At
¿
⫚ BOYC, a FNH was closed for some reason. It is said that it must be closed because this one is unneccesary. This moment was the first time FNH had been closed.
At
!
⫚ BOYC, a FNH was destroyed, but not closed for no reason. It was destroyed by itself and noone knows what exactly it happened. Many think it's maybe a lot of
[ERROR]verses
are present and not controlled. This wasn't the first moment but it was too bad and was unexpected.
At
Ħ
⫚ BOYC, one of the FNH in our FNU was stolen to get merged by another FNH. But it's only had a little content and it was young.
Fake Networkverse Hypercontainers can also be destroyed if they have had disconnected verses or loses them. Sometimes they (containers of Fake Networkverses) can even be destroyed but not the FNH.
