A
point
is a location of size zero. This means a point is not a region, but a single location.
I t is defined by Euler as "that which has no part", which is an apt description - a point has no height, width, depth, or any other measure in any other dimension.
It is also the only zero-dimensional shape, and any zero-dimensional space consists of a single point and nothing else. This means that it can be considered  as a zero-dimesional space of infinite extent, in analogue with the
plane
.
A line can be thought of as consisting of an infinite amount of points placed directly adjacent to each other.
By the same logic, a plane can be thought of as infinity lines being stacked next to each other.
