Atorm
Natural Position
Contained by
???, Some predictions show that The atorm could be in one of The first,
The Last Voids
, Where in that Last Void, The Atorm is the only thing.
Contains
Atoms
.
Planets
, And
Stars
.
Scale
Dimensionality

Diameter
510 Trillion LY
Kardashev Scale

The
Atorm,
also known as Bigger atom, Contains 2,587x of the
Atoms
In our universe, and the number is getting bigger. About 27 Billion planets, And 1.3 Trillion stars. The average Temperature for the
Void
in The
Atorm
Is about -273.13846 Degrees. Its size is 510 trillion Light Years, Lightspeed here is 2,173,202,284,381x Times the speed then usual, Lightspeed here is not the fastest thing. If you cutted The Atorm, there would be a 274 Quintillion Light year Explosion.
Problems
[
]
Like the
Alpha Hub
, Math and Size is different here, There is a example below.
Maths
[
]
Maths here is different, 1+1 would be 11, 2x2 Would be 2222, That means 3x3 would equal 333333, It basically means 2x2 = 2x2 Amount of zeroes. 1-1 Would be -1, 2-2 Would be -2. (-2)-(2) Would equal -22. 10รท2 Would equal 102, That means 10รท5 Would be 105.
Size
[
]
Size here is also different, A meter here would be 2 meters, Size here is always doubled. But sometimes, Size changes, Every couple of hours, The size Becomes 5.3% Bigger or smaller, for about 8 Seconds.
Components
[
]
It contains a EXTREMELY BIG Nucleus, EXTREMELY BIG
Electrons
,
Protons
, Gluons,
Quarks
And More. Inside the Things it is made of, It has
Atoms
,
Planets
, And
Stars
.
Appearance
[
]
It is 510 Trillion Light years, But looks the ABSOLUTE Same as a regular
Atom
. But the insides are EXTREMELY Different to a normal Atom.
Glitches
[

Glitch 1 -  If a human here jumped, The person would fall through the floor to the core of the planet.
Glitch 2 - Humans here have eyes on the same spot we have, but see 2km's above them.
Glitch 3 - There is a  0.2727272727...2727% chance that a star could be 5 meters long.
Glitch 4 - There are reports from 1782 that somebody randomly got teleported in to the backrooms.
Glitch 5 - In a corrupted
Metabubble
, There has been a  report that somebody randomly teleported in front of them from 1382
