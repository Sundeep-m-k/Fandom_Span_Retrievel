Eɣɤɧinjīverse
[
]
The Eɣɤɧinjīverse is a verse made of
Blueprint Particles
. It doesn't really have much properties, and it is very boring by itself, but things containing it are the opposite.

Wɨɫǫnik
[
]
A Wɨɫǫnik is a structure in this verse. It is made of Eɣɤɧinjīverses, and has an icosahedral shape. When Wɨɫǫniks collide, they create a big explosion, and create a substance called S̩âʄăᴋḯ. S̩âʄăᴋḯ is spread all over the Øjånsklaverse, due to Wɨɫǫniks being very common here.
S̩âʄăᴋḯ
[
]
Like it said, S̩âʄăᴋḯ forms when Wɨɫǫniks collide. It is solid, liquid, and gas all at the same time. It can warp spacetime, and it is 4D. it can also rearrange Blueprint Particles when it flows through something. It also builds structures called Ğʒumbøṅḳ.

Psæ̊çèŋ
[
]
A Psæ̊çèŋ is a verse in here. Reality works differently if you are in a Psæ̊çèŋ. Here is the system for reality inside of a Psæ̊çèŋ:
(letters are variables)
Psæ̊çèŋ[a] means you are in an a-level reality.
Psæ̊çèŋ[a,b] means you are b-level a-level reality.
Psæ̊çèŋ[a,b,c] means you are in a c-level b-level a-level reality.

Očũnid
[
]
An Očũnid is a verse that is in here. It exists. There is nothing special about this verse.
Ğʒumbøṅḳ
[
]
A Ğʒumbøṅḳ is a giant structure made of S̩âʄăᴋḯ. It is octahedral. There are an infinite number of them.
Ûlaŋǣverse
[
]
The Ûlaŋǣverse is a verse made of stuff. It has coordinates for every verse in it.
Coordinate system
[
]
Ûlaŋǣverse(a) means you are on the a-th coordinate.
Ûlaŋǣverse(a,b) and beyond are impossible but exist somehow.
