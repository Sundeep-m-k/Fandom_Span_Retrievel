You gain extreme strength, enough to lift a large galaxy with half of your fingernail and to strike with punches that feel like 1,000,000,000,000,000 brass knuckles made of diamond with spikes sharp enough to puncture 1,000,000 miles of concrete with wood, but with spikes on spikes on the spikes as well as more spikes and at 3,000,000,000x the speed of light with power to kill an immortal entity while becoming immortal yourself.
You also gain wings that allow you to effortlessly fly the width of the entire
Primordialverse
in half of a a nanosecond, as well as the ability to heal so much that your heart exploding would have the wounds from the blast (as well as the heart itself) regenerating in less than a nanosecond.
You don’t need food. You don’t need water. You don’t need air. You can survive in
Primordium Omega
or in
The Magma Realm
or even in gas
Toxicium
or some crazy death void or 1,000,000,000,000 below absolute zero. You are immune to voodoo dolls.
