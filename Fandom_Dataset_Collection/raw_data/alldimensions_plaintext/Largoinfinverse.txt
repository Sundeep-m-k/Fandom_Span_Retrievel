The Largoinfinverse is the home of
Largoinfin
.
The Largoinfinverse is not very special, as it is mostly empty. The Largoinfin will periodically traverse its empty, barren space until it finds a verse to consume.
The Largoinfinverse gives off a bright light from its center. Anything which attempts to get close to the light except Largoinfin will be repelled back and violently shredded.
The Largoinfinverse has a transparent barrier, as shown in the image.
