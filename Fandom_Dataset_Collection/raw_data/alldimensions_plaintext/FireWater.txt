Flarius and Aquarius
Creation
[
]
Less than a yoctosecond after a universe was created, a evil being was created. It had brought havoc to this universe.
The Entity
had to much power in the universe. A second after this universe was created, the
Cosmic Savior
created a being, who was a attempt to stop this being from destroying to much.
Fights
[
]
Fight I
[
]
FireWater and
the Entity
went into battle with each other.
The Entity
destroyed him almost immediately after the fight began. FireWater almost lost the ability to continue further. With his almost dead self,
the Entity
locked him away and continued his destruction.
Redemption and battle II
[
]
FireWater was barely alive, and was put in torture after he was held captive. FireWater then eventually grew with anger for what he was causing. FireWater grew so mad about him, he regenerated from all of his wounds, and escaped from captivity. FireWater went to fight
the Entity
, and grew with intense amounts of power.
The Entity
and him had a draw in battle and both could not continue. They both retreated, and both had to lessen the powers they had so they did not lose everything that they had.
The Entity
was more powerful than him, so his regeneration lasted longer.
Battle III
[
]
FireWater and
the Entity
fought again one billion years later, after both had regenerated.
The Entity
won again, but the fight was closer than the first. To prevent FireWater from fighting him again, he gave him a deal. Either he would be corrupted and joins his side for one hundred million years or he would be killed. He knew that the universe would lose power if he did die, so he decided to join him. However, he was on his side for only one million years. He left that side after several of his friends fought them to save him. They did not want to die in battle, so they let him go.
Entity
vs. FireWater
[
]
They both have only fought three times in the life of the universe they lived in. They fight once every 1 quadrillion years.
The Entity
has a 85.5% chance of wining a fight against FireWater if he is not enraged or determined to fight more than he normally would.
Present
[
]
The Entity
and FireWater escaped the universe they lived in and entered the multiverse. FireWater stayed inside of the multiverse, and dedicated his time to creating a life of his own. He then created his own super-planet inside of the multiverse. He then named it
Xenontryptophyl
. He is attempting to enter the forth dimension to become the same strength of his worst rival,
the Entity
. He is currently training on Xenontryptophyl, and will be until his next match with The Entity.
Flarius
and
Aquarius
[
]
FireWater created his own minions that he calls "elementals." They are named
Flarius
and
Aquarius
.
Flarius
was made for the heat of the universe. Examples being a star, a core of a planet, to even a entire galaxy.
Flarius
controls temperatures between 0.0...1 degrees Fahrenheit, (the temperature before the freezing point of water) to 7.2 trillion degrees Fahrenheit (the highest temperature before physics breaks down). If a temperature is any higher, than the universe
Flarius
is in will never go above 0 degrees Fahrenheit.
Flarius
mainly controls the flames in the universe it is in. (From Flare)
Aquarius was made for the cold of the universe. Examples being ice, the average temperature of the universe, or the freezing point of hydrogen. Aquarius controls temperatures between -0.0...1 degrees Fahrenheit, (slightly below the freezing point of water) to -459.67 degrees FahrenheitÂ (the temperature where atoms stop moving). If a temperature is any lower, than the universe Aquarius is in will never go lower than 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Aquarius mainly controls the liquid in the universe it is in. (From aqua)
