Background
[

The Narroplex is a meta-type extremely large, aggressive, originating as a meme complex which had later developed central meta components to transcend and become a narrative complex. The Narroplex is an extremely aggressive narrative complex; when active in a different/"prey" narrative, the Narroplex will functionally destroy and consume it. The Narroplex is functionally identical to a
Black Box
(as it is presumed to have previously been), when it's central narremes are contained within a specific narrative the Narroplex activates and instantly consumes the entire narrative.
It is unknown what exactly caused the Narroplex to transform from a meme complex to a narrative black box (if this is indeed it's origin). It is presumed that it incorporated concepts in such a way that it formed an infohazardous narrative, eventually culminating in the destruction of it's first narreme, which was a random concept. After consuming the narreme instantly, it proceeded to climb and destroy the entire
Wikiverse
(despite this the Wikiverse resurrected itself almost instantaneously). Meta-components extracted from consumption of narremes and narratives resulted in an extremely fast growing recursive function which allowed the Narroplex to destroy the entire contained super/hyper-loops and incorporate the concepts to further consume narratives.
The Narroplex's growth is functionally recursive. It incorporates narreme components from consumed narratives to increase it's influence. This has allowed it to grow extremely quickly, reaching post-loop approximately 5 months after "central activation". In fact, the totality of The Narroplex is only limited by the information that it consumes. Extremely weak lower bounds for the Narroplex are simple post-loop phenomena, while upper bounds for the Narroplex are
The Greatest End-All-Be-All
.
The Narroplex is currently in a deactivated state. Central containment operations focus on meta-disconnections of all narratives from the Narroplex, effectively neutralizing it's ability to "jump" from narratives to larger narratives. This involves destroying the core components of The Narroplex within all narratives. In addition, only 60 people are allowed access to this file to prevent any manifestation of it's narrative within our own. Specifically, Operation
Thornfield
has been carried out to terminate references (and as such connections) to The Narroplex. The global human consciousness has been infected with an artificial
cosmic idea
system (see full project) to prevent the possibility of comprehension of The Narroplex.
Thornfield

SUMMARY
:
Thornfield was a project conducted in 8654 to sterilize all human consciousness of comprehending The Narroplex with the exception of high-level government officials and agencies, including the United States FBI. This process required contact with a deity known as PL. It was a specific deity which was cooperative with human civilization after several hundred years of rituals. It was a 15-
Archverse
(relating to archverse level) god of "comprehension", which was able to turn most ideas into abstract concepts living without the need of any host organism (a Cosmic Idea). Several mini-missions were conducted, which allowed for the tools to amplify an idea into a black box. A regular idea, a concept meaning "the inability to comprehend anything specific to narratives consuming narratives, and only such". This was then sent to the deity via a ritual, allowing for the creation of a stable/cosmic idea. A second deity (name is infohazardous) was chosen for the purposes of activation. Another specific ritual was enacted, allowing for the creation of a suitably powerful infectious cosmic idea. The idea was then transferred directly into the human consciousness, and activated. Thornfield as a result was successful.
Narroplex Invasive Stages
[
]
This heading refers to the Narroplex entering and destroying a narrative. Information about destroyed narratives shows that destruction occurs in four stages. Information was collected in nearly 200 narratives from Operations Q, B, and Over the Tunnel. The summarized information is below.
Stage 1:
Upon contact with the narrative, the Narroplex does not immediately destroy it, and is instead mostly inert. The narrative suffers no side effects. However, once the event occurs, there is no possible method of purging the Narroplex or preventing any of the other stages. At this point, destruction is inevitable and can only be delayed via the destruction of presumed vectors.
Stage 2
: In this stage, the Narroplex activates in a limited way. Any data (textual, imagery) associated with the Narroplex becomes blank. Individuals who know of the existence of the Narroplex cease to exist. The activation of the stage (like all other stages after this one) depend on the "natural" narrative timescales. For example, if regular events occur over brief timescales (as short as seconds), then it will take about 20 years for stage 2 to activate. If an event occurs over long timescales (several million years), then it will take several quadrillion years for the Narroplex to activate. In all infected narratives, there is enough time between Stage 1 and Stage 2 that many events can continue. In addition, several aspects of the narrative is lost. For example, if a character is living in a forest, then there may be a notable absence of regularly appearing animals. A side-character may also note their lack of teeth, eyes, etc. Presumably these operate as the initial vectors of the Narroplex, allowing the Narroplex to invade the narrative.
Stage 3:
Damage is widespread and severe. Most complex phenomena is weakened due to the large scale changes in the narrative. Characters will have large-scale changes to their memories and possibly the structure of their brain, causing death. There will also be a notable absence of several side characters, presumably due to destruction. Initial infectious vectors spread the Narroplex, causing a chain reaction. This can occur via the transmission of any information by the infected vector/individual to another, uninfected individual. In any case, all infected are destroyed by the Narroplex.
Stage 4: The main character is dead. The narrative ceases to exist. Narroplex will consume the narrative as detailed in the above "Background".
Possible Origins
[
]
The leading theory suggests that the Narroplex was once a large black box. Before it's alternation into it's current state, The Narroplex was quite a sizable
black box
idea complex. In fact, the Narroplex was one of the largest known black boxes, far exceeding the size of the current largest scale black boxes. Alteration occurred at least estimated 13 quadrillion years ago. It is presumed that during this time, the Narroplex suffered a narrative construct property domination. More specifically, this is referring to the domination/turning-point of narrative-type constructs over regular concepts as the dominant forces within the black box. After this turning point, based on current average evolutionary estimations, the Narroplex morphed into it's state from thirteen days to sixteen million years later.
There is much evidence and physical theories which suggest the authenticity of this theory. For instance, the Baseline Narrative model confirms that the Narroplex could not have always been in it's current state. This model says that all narratives were once composed of a variable amount of base narrative concepts or were generated as the product of another already existing narrative. There is also more physical evidence suggesting that the Narroplex was once within our own narrative. Computer models show the existence of an extremely large black box 10
5093
years ago. Using PROTOCOL Orange, the black box was revealed to be composed of both
cosmic ideas
and narrative-like properties. However, this black box disappeared by unknown means 0.54 x 10
5093
years ago. Although the simulation is not completely accurate (regarding temporal accuracy of events) it does provide further evidence.
Investigations are still ongoing. The leading theory has yet to be proven.
