is a calendar used for the majority of this

On the
Omniverse
article, it is explained how The Box's layers collapsed on themselves. These collapses were periodical, and every single one of them took exactly the same amount of time. This amount of time was then measured precisely and labeled as the OYC.
1 OYC is approximately (in Earth measurements) 791 years, 3 months and 25 days, 2 hours, 36 minutes 57 seconds, 600 miliseconds, and 864 femtoseconds. This can be pretty accurately approximated as

{\displaystyle \frac{7} {22-7\pi}}
years.
Subdivisions
[
]
An OYC has many subdivisions, infact, an OYC has so many nested subdivisions, that the last official one is comparable to a planck time. Contrary to what one might think upon reading this for the first time, every single one of these divisions are used just as much as all of the ones above and below it.
Some divisions are used more, and some aren't, there are many types for specific fields and large enough civilizations.
OW: The Omniversal Week is equal to 1/512 of an OYC, or around 564 days, or 1.54
Earth
years.
OD: The Omniversal Day - a translation only used by
humans
, is equal to 1/5040 of an OYC, which is equal to around 57 and 1/4 days, about 2 months.
OH: The Omniversal Hour is equal to 1/50,400 of an OYC (ten times less than an Omniversal Day), which is approximately equal to 5 Earth days and 17 hours.
