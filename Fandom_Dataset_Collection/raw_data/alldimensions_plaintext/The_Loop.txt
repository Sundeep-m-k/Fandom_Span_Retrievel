An uncountably infinite number of reality plane's, our local one being called
The Sea

Position
Contained by:
The Loop
(proven),
The Oven
(theoretically)
Contains:
The Sea
and many other Reality Planes.
The Loop
is an infinite loop of reality planes, like
The Sea
.
Appearance
[
]
From any reality plane, if you got on the top of one, you would see nothing but different versions and colorations of
The Sea
. The angle taken in the picture is as if you were above the loop instead of looking outwards.
Inside
[
]
Inside the Loop, there are infinitely many combinations and types and colors of reality planes. Each of the black spots are rips where reality doesn't function properly.
Outside?
[
]
The Loop is contained by itself, as it loops itself infinitely.  However, Theories of a hypothetical object called
the oven
suggest that the reasonit is so cold is because it exceeds the 64 bit integer limit for temperature, thus heading back to negatives.  This, however, has not yet been confirmed.
