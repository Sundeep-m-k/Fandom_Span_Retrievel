Introduction
[
]
Yoolith
is the good in the bad, the bad in the good. it is the reason for the balance of everything inside. Anything outside its Square would be unbalanced if not for Yoolith.
The Square
[
]
The Square is the barrier of Yoolith, it is very thin with it being made out of only
Protoverses
. These protoverses are different models, with more spiritualistic Protos. If the box around it ruptures, the energy will begin to be imbalanced
The Great Flower
[
]
The Great Flower is a spinning disk rotating at 1 lightyear per second. every time it does a rotation, 1
box
explodes. These boxes are always replaces, though, and the neutral energy in Yoolith generates what is lost anyways. The blackness comes from the evil of the Yangas, in their great density.
Clouds
[
]
The clouds are places where energy of both good and evil intentions is gathered within Yoolith, and the clouds do not contain any
Yangas
, but they harvest small amounts of the energy within Yanga and the
Yinas
within those Yangas to keep the balance of good and evil throughout Yoolith, and every Yoolith does this.
Flower Clouds
[
]
Flower Clouds are the clouds inside of the great flower, they are the reason the flower can spin and cause great destruction to boxes. The clouds there harvest the majority of the energy from the locations in the ever-dense Flower.
Corner Clouds
[
]
The Corner Clouds are what keeps matter from going past the square. when matter gets past it, it shoots out lasers that destroy the matter trying to get out.
Core
[
]
The Core is what keeps the entire thing together, it has infinite gravity but The Flower keeps things from falling into it.
