About

The
Papers
are indescribably long and wide (however only a meter tall) structures. Them, unlike what their name may indicate at first, are not made of paper at all, and are instead made of a
Primordium Delta
and
Alpha
mix, and some cell like structures called 'Realitators' that turn things drawn on them into reality.
Threats to the Papers
[
]
If a Paper were to rip, its local
Metareality-Webs
would tear along with that rip, and if they were shredded by something like the
Paper Shredder
(Created by
Tenebriyza
) or
the Scissors
, the Metareality-Webs would instead be shredded and/or corrupted leaving no
life
within them, meaning that entities such as
THE CREATOR
have to make sure they're safe from all and any threats.
Because of that, only a few beings are allowed (and are even capable) of drawing on the Papers, such as THE CREATOR, the
Primordial
, etc.
