A
Supertime and Superreality
is not really a
verse
, but instead it is more similar to a
Time and reality
with some changes, being the reason they have such a name.
These places are looped for ᾮ times, though some of them can reach up to ᾮ
ᾮ
amount of loops, meaning they have even more loops than Times and Realities, being the OTHER reason Supertimes and Superrealities receive their name.
