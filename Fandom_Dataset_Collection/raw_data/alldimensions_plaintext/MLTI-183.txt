multiverse
of all. Weirdly, it only contains approx. 100

(
List
), when its size could make it contain more. Even with its size, lots of creatures are inside its multiverses, fighting to see who is the MLTI-183 alpha. Some of these beings are known, but no name was given to them. Some of these species are:
- Some 3 meters tall praying mantis with orange colors.
- Some fishes with arms and 4 eyes.
- Unknown one-eyed beasts with tentacles.
And lots more!
