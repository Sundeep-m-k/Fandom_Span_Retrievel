The
Obsidianite chunks
are not really verses by themselves, but rather components of another ones. Like their name implies, they're small parts of another Obsidianite structures, specifically the
Obsidianite massifs
. Obsidianite chunks are basically bigger
Obsidianite bits
.
Even tough their name has the word Obsidianite, these really arent made of something similar to obsidian... the
Obsidianite
is rather a way stronger material that shares a similar color scheme to the obsidian. So thats why its named like this.
They're mostly hollow, thus being able of containing the previous verses in the
hierarchy
.
