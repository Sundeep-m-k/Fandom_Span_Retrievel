"Boundary of reality". In other words, the
limit of
physics
and ultimate border. As you approach it, the common world gets distorted by the ungodly power of everything slowly crumbling away. Undefined point of truly no return, where beyond it is an eternal wasteland of darkness. We live in the central region of this spherical border, gladly enjoying the mercy of physics. However, there are alien and mystic scenery unseeable inside the safe zone. Below is fearsome yet beautiful sceneries one will see while approaching the edge and beyond the cradle of existence.
NOTE: The whole page is based on Minecraft's old and awesome bug:
farm l
ands
.
SECOND NOTE: the border is also the maximum influential region of
Quantu
mverse
, meaning quantum verse is the former of the ultimate border.

Nothing TOO bad happens in Normal regions, aside from some minor(?) unnatural look of space.

explanation about (𝔀^𝔀^𝔀)*𝔀 is written
he
re
Escaping from The center region (assuming you have an impossible spaceship) makes the shape of verses (which are commonly perfect and flawless spheres) get a little stretched and become oval. No, it's not a diameter increment of infinitesimal length, but clearly observable stretching. If the original verse sphere is "O", oval-shaped verses of this region are more like "ㅇ".
For structures, their border's contrast of farthest and closest from the center is higher than usual. For example, if there is a structure with the shape of
a stellated
dodecahedron
, the
spikes extend
unnaturally long
above the structure's center. And for linear networks such as
Uqraek
fiber
, stretching is a significant problem. The linear networks and structures gradually become thin lines and disappear near the edge of The unnatural region.
at the exact edge, you can notice something weird. although it's a rare phenomenon, some verses may have a perfect clone verse(s) within a distance of few times its diameter. No, they are not a parallel universe, and they are too common to be considered as work of
The
Box
sort of structures. This is caused by the distortion of space here not only being able to replicate visual of verse but everything of it (physics, time flow, history, ...). Originally a space should not behave like that, which indicates space itself starts to, sort of "glitch" from here.
Much clearer evidence of "glitching" space is a truly weird one; sometimes, the tiny tiny verse can survive even if
-sized verse undergoes violent collapse right next to it (truly
WT
F
!!
moment). Energy itself is struggling to flow through some space, which is quite worrying news if you like living. And for the structures, whose borders are purely made from dense energy... they frequently send out gigantic explosions as their border breaks and spilling inside is converted into pure energy.

Occasionally, verses located inside The significant glitch region can appear to be bigger than ∐-size. Which is a
little
terrifying
if you realize the maximum diameter a verse can have is
ℰ
0
. How is it possible, when no property can ever do that? The answer is an immense spacial distortion of "
...
no
" level. ∐ or bigger verses' actual physic influences a region absolutely incomparably smaller than visual of verse. If you entered one of these impossible verses, you will find yourself not influenced by verse's physics. Simply, verse's
"sprites" are bugged that they grew
so much bigger than their "hitboxes"
.
Going a little further from starting point of the region adds new weirdness: some verses do not match its visuals and physics law! To make the concept a little easier: it's like seeing
our universe full of
infinite power sources
, although as you know, that's not what our universe's physics allows.
Right in front of the region's edge is filled with ...
beaut
iful
sceneries. Although normal and perfectly fine verses are a majority, many verses have their visuals placed really far from where their physics influence. Structures are at least a little more normal since their visuals still carry a border with them.

Things are
even nastier
than they
are in the former region
! Now, inner material, physics, border, energy, and all other components of many verses and structures are all playing on their own. Sometimes even individual components get chopped into smaller regions. This only makes finding the original shape of the verse even harder. If the REAL location where the verse is actually in, moves, so does every component of it. Like illusions, an individual component can come together to become normal, if the verse's real location is a certain point.
And you know what's better? In the outer part of The shattered visuals region, many verses and structures' disassembled components are each replicated. Not only that, components, as well as the original location of verse, are usually shattered into
pieces.
Oh g
reat

Along with space being distorted in
a

, even time itself begins to flow at a non-regular rate. No, it's not verses or structures' time speeds; they can easily be altered by
ti

out
side
. However, the time-flow speed of inter-versal and inter-structural spaces are not. Nothing can alter it except space itself, which is possible from The order-break region and beyond. At some regions, time flows insanely fast (such as ∐ OYC/sec), or don't flow at all. Time not flowing is not quite a problem, because it just causes little inconvenience of
everything around time
-stop region freezing
.
Faster time-flow, however, IS a big problem since
entropy grows in
comparably faster
than anywhere inside the ultimate border. Space is not adapted for entropy increase of The order-break region. Fast-time-flow regions' verses and structures maintain their shape. For their borders, inner objects, and every other individual component have a dark, staticky look. It happens because space is curled up so bad here, that any energy particle gets eternally trapped inside countless closed loops of space.
Then there is the edge of The order-break region, a perfect dark shell enveloping the entire world inside it. No; it's not a void nor a huge inside-out black hole. It is
a space lacking
energy itself
, as energy particles are
all
trapped inside unobservably tiny, closed loops of twisted space. Observing beyond can only be done by measuring the spatial attractions objects create. Observing beyond with the method proves the edge of The order-break region is not the end to
the w
orld
(is pun intended? Yesn't) of fantastic and alien space.

Anything beyond the Normal regions is broken in countless ways, except afew chosen ones that are corrupted as little as possible. But who cares if only a tiny percentage of verses are not broken badly!

Like all other components of many structures and verses, physics starts to glitch out. Physics of them slowly moves away from where they are supposed to be, starting to influence regions far from their original locations. For some verses and structures, physics gets so far away from original locations, it just disappears. Those verses and structures have no physics, only the empty shell of visuals and eternally frozen components.

Anywhere before this, and everything is spread randomly through space. Anywhere beyond this, then everything is one behind another. In other words: linear alignments. Countless clear lines expand from The physic collapse region. Or rather, they are similar to countless "axis" of the marginal model plot, slowly being revealed because randomness decreases at The linear alignments region. You can imagine a situation like an urchin (probably more powerful than all gods beyond
alph
asm
) with a limitless number of eternally extending long and thin spikes (that varies in length), each jeweled with everything you can imagine.
Traveling to edge shows something odd! instead of "Absolute God Urchin's spikes", lines expanding from center start to resemble donuts. Go a little more out, all lines concentrate to a disk. then the disk expands forever until even linear arrangement gets its components all disassembled, fading out completely. Some lines may survive disappearing, continuing the tiny road of order among immeasurably big and empty space. However... basically everything in the order continuity line is corrupted and some even have
physics that cha

Continuity road's objects start to lose details. It is almost as if a resolution of space itself slowly going down, where minuscule particles mostly disappear and are replaced by mysterious substitute forces. A bit like replacing gradually replacing all parts of the human body with machines: starting as small as replacing cells with robots, then to arms, legs, and heads.
If a human body is fully replaced with machines doing t
he same functions (including the brain), is it really a human?
Probably not. Same for everything of continuity road inside The lost details region: at some point, they stop being what they originally were.

Things (which are now just weird arrangements of unknowable forces) still have physics of their own. But they are super fragile. Physics goes beyond constantly changing moment to moment, they now blink... disappearing and reappearing as a different form.
objects are easily destroyed by "blinking" of their own physics, severely damaging little order of continuity road that may have left.

wa
it
. didn't the stretching happen long before, at normal region? That's true, but once again the majority of objects experience rapid stretching. It's not gradual, it is instant. When anything enters The stretched region, they are VERY likely to be instantly stretched to an unending, thin stream of unknown material. Sometimes these streams can form tiny tiny order continuity roads of their own, at least raising broken-as-hell order of space a little bit.

Eventually, all order continuity roads loose everything except one. That last one is final survivor of deadly game played by breaking space. The reward is order continuity line containing only clones of itself, stretching for
NPD. If the final survivor is luckier than usual, clones of themselves form a little tiny grid. Phenomenons ultimately make region look boring, filled with endless amount of exactly same verses.

an unima
ginably tiny
percentage of order continuity roads managed to get here, which are about to be completely obliterated by all limits falling down to lower levels. Destruction source is space being more and more diluted into oblivion, dropping maximum capacity of it. Usually, space can hold basically limitless energy, dimensions, and every single property is existable. Here, however,
limitless is no
longer limitless
. maximum capacity drops like crazy. At first, it is not noticeable since, after The stripe world, the average density of space is kinda ok. But as objects get closer to the edge of this region, they start to crumble away.
The first limit to lower down drastically, is the limit of dimensions. The complexity of objects gradually goes down, becoming close to the realm below
∐
. Although ∐ is incomprehensively big on its own, limits dropping to ∐ level is a drop bigger than ∐. Then the drop rate gets accelerated like crazy. In some areas, dimensions fall as low as finite level, while other limits falling rate goes on drugs.

limit of

, and maximum timeflow rate follow the limit of dimensions. All activities of objects are severely disturbed, and sometimes, they even get destroyed. Each
NPD farther from the center of the ultimate border drops various limits drastically. By the way, when some limits drop a tiny bit faster than others, it becomes clear what that limit restricts. And by that, weird limits such as the limit of
big

Some limits including a limit of dimensions plummet so much, that they drop

At a place where limits fall so fast, they now disappear one by one. Limits fall into utter oblivion of negativity and below, that nothing can be influenced by them. So if the limit of dimension goes below the oblivion (which is actually what it is doing here), a concept called "dimension" is just strictly removed from space. Gradually all concepts disappear, even the concept of space itself. What's left is nothing... absolutely nothing... except unobservable limits falling downward for

LE DISCLAIMER:
∞
{\displaystyle \infty}
here refers to "limitless" (not
Absolute infinity
), which means "absolutely, in
alphasm
's name, no boundary"
↑
∞
{\displaystyle \infty}
here, also, refers to "limitless".
↑
Sorry for same references...
∞
{\displaystyle \infty}
will mean "limitless" from now and on.
↑
The reason why Existence rank, Finality index, and FOEI (the one that's especially weird since
it got 3
rd
term that is either plus or minus
) splits into several values, is that they are not definitive
but range where they could be
.
↑
yup, these three values are getting really crazy.
Hey, at least they don't exist as range!
↑
From here, FOEI stays at
F
O
E
I
(
(
∞
,
)
∞
∞
)
{\displaystyle FOEI((\infty,)^{\infty}\infty)}
. although there are almost nothing inside regions beyond this, their sheer size raises their FOEI to absolute highest.
↑
yes... it is the range again. Glitching space produces lots of existence rank and finality index. No, it's not various places having different of those values, but rather space splitting into
few
possible outcomes that co-exists in one place.
↑
Oh and the range is only gonna get more
disappointingly large
afterward.
↑
oh wow, a minus range!!
↑
Finality index and Existence rank is suddenly dropping to smalle-than-1 fractions! :O
↑
Ordinals other than biggest 3s (
∞
{\displaystyle \infty}
is not ordinal since it is concept representing "limitless") are now needed to represent two values. Not only that, maximum value drops to minus!
↑
Because limits have fell below zero, nothing, not even time and space themselves are able to exist.  As a result, FOEI drops to 0.
