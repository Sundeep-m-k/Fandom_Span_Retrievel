The Sequioaverse is a supposedly small island-shaped verse that is home to a Sequoia tree around 32 meters tall (same as the verse's diameter) in its center. This tree is also surrounded by several smaller Sequoia trees.
However, this tree is not normal, as the higher you climb on it, the larger everything seems to get. Its branches also continue to branch out infinitely. These properties give the verse an infinite dimensionality as well as kardashev scale rating.
If someone gets high enough on the tree, they will begin to perceive even Planck level objects as being larger than them, which is physically impossible. Reality at this level begins to bend, eventually transforming the landscape into an entirely new verse.
