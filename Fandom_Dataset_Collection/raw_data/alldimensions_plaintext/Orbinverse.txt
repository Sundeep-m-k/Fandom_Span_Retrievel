About
[
]
The
Orbinverses
are a type of
verse
which mainly contain two objects: the
Ends of Chains
and the Ends of Chains' polar opposites, the
Ends of Darkness
.
End's motion
[
]
Both the Ends of Chains and the Ends of Darkness orbit each other within the Orbinverses in an elliptical motion, while everything else is surrounded by a very large
void
.
History
[

This section has one of the few known stories related to an Orbinverse.

The Ancient Escape ship, which didn't use a indescribability drive, was actually stuck in the Orbinverse for a while, and only escaped around

ago. We are still unsure regarding why it would've taken so long, but it's just how history goes.

After escaping the End of Chain, the
Escape crew
got into the Orbinverse and escaped the End of Chain. It seems that the surface of the 'final' layer of the End of Chain had a lensing property that allowed for sight into the very middle of it.
The End of Darkness was located, and was named that way because it emitted so much light that it acted almost like a white hole, with photons actually pushing the ship when they got within around

light-OYCs of it's 'surface'.
After research, a station was made, and after some measurements and a new ineffability drive, the crew escaped into the
next type of verse
.
Composition
[
]
Other than the Ends of Chains and the Ends of Darkness, the Orbinverses' voids are actually full of weakly interacting
particles
called
Kappa Particles
[

]
that cause turbulent motion near the center of their Orbinverse, lowering the energy of photons in certain ways to make light slightly blue.
Further out in the Orbinverses, these particles barely move at all, causing a spherical 'wall' of Kappa Particles to form, which is tough to pass without certain drives (like the ineffability drive). This sort of structure makes many shells of Kappa Particles around the verse, where particles move the least.
Etymology
[
]
The name 'Orbinverse' came from the two words, those being 'orb' and 'inverse', because from outside of the Ends of Chains, they looked like an orb, and so the inverse of an orb is whatever isn't where the orb is. The name became Orbinverse, even though they actually contains the Ends of Chains.

Except around the Ends Of Darkness, where they are absent for around Œ© OYC due to photons pushing them away.
