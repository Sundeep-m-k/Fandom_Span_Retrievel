Size
A lot bigger than every other article that the ultimatum contains.
Dimensionality
Can vary from 0 to numbers even bigger than ∞ x ∞ x ∞... (Uncountable times more)
Position
Contained by
T H E B U L T I M A T U M
. But you can still make something who contains the ultimatum. But if you do it, please edit the page and put it here.
Contains
Every other 'verse, reality, etc. who doesnt contain the ultimatum. This even includes the
Wikiverse
, and even bigger things than those, if they exist, but doesnt contain the ultimatum.
The Katastrofo Void
.
The Ultimatum
is the end, the last, the biggest (Not anymore, lol). It contains EVERYTHING who is smaller than him. When i say EVERYTHING, is EVERYTHING. This means this object cant be contained? No, you can make other even bigger.
But,
if it doesnt contain the Ultimatum, the Ultimatum contains it.
This part is very important.
Well, now lets talk about its temperature.
I will resume this in some word:
Varies a lot in each place of the ultimatum
. Theres not an exact number of temperature in this place. Its practically imposible to get the information of all places the ultimatum has, so the only answer to the question is the one i leaved before.
Like i sayed before, the ultimatum can be the biggest, but only from now (Not anymore, go see
The Bultimatum
). If you want to make other bigger, go ahead. This object can be an end-all-be-all but it can be contained. Remember what i sayed some paragraphs above.
