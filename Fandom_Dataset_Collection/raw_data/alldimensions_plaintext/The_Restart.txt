The collapse of time and space started and ended right before the creation of the
Omniverse
, where a race of humanoids was forced to battle gods under the rule of a mysterious god, soon to be revealed to be
The Devil
. At this time,
Magistri Tempus
could be observed and existed as a being. The race of humanoids proceeded to try and defeat
Magistri Tempus
. Magistri Tempus was then forced to restart time, resulting in multiple new Timelines and the Omniverse to begin.
Magistri Tempus
was then forced to become somewhat Non-Existant.
