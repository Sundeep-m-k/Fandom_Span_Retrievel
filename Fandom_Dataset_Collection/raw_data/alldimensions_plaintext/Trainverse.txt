Areas
[
]
There are several areas on this verse. There is the slow speed one, the medium speed one, the high speed one and the sonic speed one. Each area has trains of that speed. The faster the trains on each area, the longer it needs to power up. A train can take someone to a verse a maximum of three multiverses over.
Fastest Train
[
]
The fastest train in this verse is the Noetharw 1000. It can go as fast as light but needs three hours to power up. This one isn't used much.
Slowest Train
[
]
The slowest train only takes a millisecond to charge up, but goes at the speed of a snail. This train is called the Snael 2000. It is never used.
Usage
[
]
This verse is mostly used for quick travel. That is why the slow speed area is used the most, because it only takes a maximum of a minute to charge up. The higher speed areas are usually used for longer distances.
