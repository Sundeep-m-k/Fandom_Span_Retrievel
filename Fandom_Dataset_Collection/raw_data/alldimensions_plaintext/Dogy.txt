üêï
's friends.
It can speak all languages and it is smart. However, everything that Dogy says is corrupt in many ways due to constantly adjusting to many languages. Many times, it can be impossible to decipher what Dogy is saying.
It can detect broken matter in
The Fried Egg
that were broken by
Cat
, but only Poorly Misplaced bBee can fix the matter.
Dogy can also destroy "infected" parts of
The Glitch Space
, but chooses to use this power to a lesser extent, as it is less powerful than The Tiger, and Dogy is more "innocent" and less "aggresive".
There is no specific way to pronounce his name, in fact, he may have no real name, and ‚ÄúDogy‚Äù is a placeholder name.
