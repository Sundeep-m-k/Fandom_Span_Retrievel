A veritaversje (verita (truths) + verse (container) + je (small)) is a container of a reality. Because everything that could ever be exists in a veritaversje, they could be considered to be a "greater multiverse" of sorts. Veritaversjes are defined through their axioms, and because there are an infinite amount of available axioms, there are infinity factorial amount of veritaversjes.
Like all metaversjes, it is an abstraction of reality and not actually a thing.

Physical
[
]
Physical veritaversjes are made up of space and time. Things in space move through time, interacting with eachother according to the axioms. Physical veritaversjes are infinite and unbounded.
Static
[
]
Static veritaversjes are abstract concepts such as math. In these veritaversjes there exists only truths, so they are very useful to think about for complex life.
Dynamic
[
]
Dynamic veritaversjes are changing things like simulations. They are different from physical ones because they are bounded and do not possess the true randomness required to form greater versjes
