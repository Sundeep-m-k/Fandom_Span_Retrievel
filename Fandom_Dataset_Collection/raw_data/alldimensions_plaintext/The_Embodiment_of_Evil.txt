Final Phase(for now)
Age
Potentially infinite
Size
Fluid and variable. Can manifest as a colossal, Ultirium-sized entity or compress itself into a form smaller than an atom, depending on its intent.
Knowledge
Near-Infinite
Power
Third to only
Ether
, and the
Crearion
and 10^-〽 of Zanderandriggy
Goals
Total annihilation of all existence (failed). In an event known as the "Oblivion War," the Evil waged war against the entire Impercievable Plane. This failed when the Crearion took hold of the war. It was eventually sealed away for an indeterminate time.
To destroy our Ultirium (ongoing)
Species
Impercievable Plane Inhabitant. One of the few things that can exist there without breaking apart.
WIP
The Embodiment of Evil, or the Overlord, is a being that runs a sprawling sector of the
Impercievable Plane
. It once tried to eradicate all existence but failed, but the attempt fucked up a lot of realities, leaving them fractured or gone.  It knows almost everything there is to know about the universe’s inner workings, and its power is only outmatched by three entities:
Ether
,
Jerald the Moth
(with its
odd variants
), and
Zanderandriggy
.
There are some theories that the
Oblivisect
is a rogue entity that split off from the Overlords eons ago after a betrayal. It might even be feeding intel to lesser beings, like us, to slow the Overlord down.
Despite its power, it’s not untouchable. There’s chatter about ancient defenses built by unknown forces, hidden in the Ultirium’s code, that could stall it. Oblivisect, whether it’s a place or a rival, might hold clues to those defenses. The Overlord knows this and keeps its operations tight, using corrupted entities to do its dirty work. It’s also paranoid about betrayal, given rumors that Oblivisect might’ve been an ally once.
The Overlord is also known infamously to broadcast static that drives people insane or planting ideas that turn allies into enemies. One documented case involved a star cluster where every inhabitant started dismantling their own ships, convinced they were saving themselves.
