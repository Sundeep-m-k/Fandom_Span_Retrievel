"What the f*ck did you just f*cking say about me, you little b*tch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Antimatter Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on the 9th Dimension, and I have over 300 NNnNeMI-NNnNe confirmed kills. I am trained in potato warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire Antimatter Galactic armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another infinity. I will wipe you the f*ck out with Max All mashing the likes of which has never been seen before in this dimension, mark my f*cking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Interdimensional network? Think again, f*cker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of autobuyers across the galaxy and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the Big Crunch, maggot. The Big Crunch that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re f*cking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven 😠💩 different ways, and that’s just with my mouse. Not only am I extensively trained in dimension shift combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Antimatter Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the universe, you little shit. If only you could have known what unhevi retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your f*cking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re buying until 10, you goddamn idiot. I will shit antimatter shit all over you and you will drown in it. You’re f*cking dead, kiddo."
