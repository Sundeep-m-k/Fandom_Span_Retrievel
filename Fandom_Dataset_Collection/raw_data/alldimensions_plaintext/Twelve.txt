Appearance
[
]
Twelve, from the outside, appears to be a strangely shaped and strangely colored verse that vaguely resembles a sphere. From the inside, Twelve appears to be an infinite, black expanse with nothing inside of it.
Structure
[
]
Twelve has a very boring, void-like interior, with exactly 12 entrances to the 12 Elevens Twelve contains. These entrances glow a bright, yellow light that can be seen from up to 10 AU away. However, since Twelve's time is slowed down, the light travels a lot slower, making finding one of these entrances very hard.
