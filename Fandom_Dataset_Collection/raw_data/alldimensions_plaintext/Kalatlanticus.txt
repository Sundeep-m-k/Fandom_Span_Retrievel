The Kalagrids
Kalatlanticus
are humongous planetoid verses. Their surface is covered in a substance made entirely of
Kalagrids
(reffered to as K-water) which behaves similar to water. This K-water is actually home to lots of entities which are considered transcendently enormous for us (but the size of a normal fish relative to a Kalatlanticus itself).
Measurements used:
Kalameter (klm) - 1/12,742,000 of a Kalatlanticus's diameter (Basically a meter relative to a Kalatlanticus)
Kanimeter (knm) - 1,000 klm (kalameters)

Composition
[
]
Kalatlanticus have the same composition as a planet. They have a relatively large core, which is composed of a substance called
K-Invar
which is made out of
kalagrid
-sized clumps of invar. Then, they have a liquid mantle and a crust, which are made of K-rock, which is composed of verses that are relatively similar to Invarverses.
History
[
]
Our Kalatlanticus was created just like a regular kalaplanet; One of its
Kalaverses
was a clump of
Kalagrid
matter and
K-Invar
, but then it started expanding. The Kalagrid matter stuck to the clumps of K-Invar and separated from the other clumps, becoming its own planet. After isiofinitillions of years, our Kalatlanticus developed life.
Entities
[
]
Kalatlanticus have a LOT of different living beings which are transfinitely larger and stronger than all entities smaller.
Kalacarp
[
]
Kalacarps are a species of entity that resides in the shallow regions of a Kalatlanticus. They have a size of 0.8 klm, and feed on Kala'algae. They typically serve as prey in the Kalatlantican ecosystems, but they are still horribly dangerous to a normal person who is transfinitely smaller than them.
