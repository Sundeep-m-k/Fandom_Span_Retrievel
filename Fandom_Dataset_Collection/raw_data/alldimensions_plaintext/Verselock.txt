The verselock is a metaphysical framework where anything that falls into the state of being is contained within it.

What is the state of being?
[
]
The state of being is very close to the state of existing, but way more complex, the state of being is existing under the definition of "is" or "was" or "can be", and if you can define something under the conceptual framework and ontological structure of "is", then it is contained within the metaphysical framework of verselock.
What is ontology?
[
]
Ontology is the study of existence, and why, and what, ontology is one HUGE question that explains more than The theory of Relativity ever could, for example, Martin Heidegger's being and time, where he explains that the question of being is what defines the entity, but there has to be a entity to interact with the question of being. Ontology is the philosophical understanding of existence and reality, it as itself defines the very world around you with dasein(dasein is the structure of being, thought, space-time, concepts).
Conclusion
[
]
The state of being does not matter whether real or fictional(because thought and mind can define something that is thus it exists ontologically) or beyond the bounds of observation/human limits, what matters is that you can be sub-described as something that is.
What can be defined using the state of being
[
]
The state of being can define any fictional or real description and the branch(possible physical interpretation), this means that any writing or possible writing that falls under anything(incomprehensible, comprehensible, AI, etc) can be ontologically interpreted as real, and exists under the definition of is, which does mean that verselock is paradoxical, but that does not mean that it is not true, as scientific and lingual paradoxes exist, that does not mean that language is incorrect or science is incorrect.
What is "is"
[
]
The word "is" seems very simple, we use it a lot, but tell me the definition, why is this seemingly simple word, so hard to describe, is can be a question, a explanation, a description, and yet we do not know how to fully define it, it is principles like these that leave humans questioning where the word even came from, yes of course we have a definition for the word "is" but, what does it mean to be "is"? This question is one of the very foundations of ontology.
Existential ontological questions
[
]
Ontological questions are the very base of ontology, and most of them are existential.
Examples:
What does it mean to be?
What is definition?
What is being?
These questions define the very structure of ontology, and you can think very deep about them when you understand the true scale of these questions on a humanly level, they are so complex that these questions themselves define ontology, which defines reality, and the gap between reality and fiction.
Better description of verselock
[
]
Verselock is a all ontological encompassing plane, this includes the
Allsphere
because that exists under fiction, and is a fictional state, and fictional being, or the ontologically real state of being because it consciously exists in a physical ontological plane, and if you claim to exist outside ontology that claim itself is in a state of being, and existing is under ontology, the verselock is the scope of linguistics(not only linguistics) as linguistics are a sub-limit in ontology, and the scope of linguistic branching, and linguistic potential, and linguistic false potential, even below-interpretation level linguistics(defining something beyond language) and below-interpretation level linguistics potential; but verselock also encompasses the very structure of itself, and the very structure of ontology(the ontological questions).
