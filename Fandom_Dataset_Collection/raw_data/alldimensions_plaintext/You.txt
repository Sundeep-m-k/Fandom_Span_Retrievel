You
is the person who is reading this text.
(probably)
You
may be thinking,
'but I'm not you? I'm me!'
Well, that is correct, but when one person wants to refer to another person, they say
"
you
"
instead of
"
me
"
in English. Hmm.
So who, or what, are you exactly? This question can be both very easy and very difficult to answer and it can be viewed in many ways. You might point out,
'you already answered what is "you"! The very first line of this page is "You is the guy reading this."'
Well, that is one way (and, it must be said, a simple one) to look at it, but it's not valid in every perspective. Heck, it can even be considered not factually true! For example, such an assumption can be proven false if you are not a guy or if you are not reading this (the vast majority).
What is the point of continuing to try and figure out who you are, if every attempt can be denied in some way or another? In the end,
we can't prove anything
and we have to rely on
precepts that are merely asserted and not defended
.
Gosh this is a stupid page
I might expand and improve it if I find motivation :>
