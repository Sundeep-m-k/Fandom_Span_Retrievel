The
Wormholeprison
is located in the
Berryverse
. It is 2 wormholes that have collided and corrupted in such a way that they make their own "realm" in the center. The Wormholeprison is physically impossible to escape, as the wormholes create a paradox realm, an infinite plane with nothing but white "tiles" as described by explorers using disposable atomic cameras. Due to the endless realm, it is impossible to be in the same place as someone else or some
thing
else. It is an empty void to everyone and everything that goes there.
