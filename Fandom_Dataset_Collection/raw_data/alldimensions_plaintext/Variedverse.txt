Yourmomverses
First recorded state.
The
Variedverse
is similar to the
Yourmomverses
, but instead of only containing variations of mothers, it contains variations of all known entities.  The Variedverse has too many states to list, but the most notable ones will be summarized below;
The Variedverse likely existed long before even
The First Boom
, so it's basically impossible to tell what it's first state was.  However, the first ever recorded state of the Variedverse was in a Mucube-like formation.  Not much is known about this state, other than it was the state of the Variedverse approximately 0.007
voidseconds
after
The First Boom
, and that only a few entities likely existed in it.
142
OYC
after the state of the variedverse completely shifted around constantly, there was an entire week where it maintained one position;  The triangle.  It's unconfirmed why it kept this shape for so much longer than others, but it's theorized that it was likely due to the triangle having the strongest molecular structure out of any shape, which allowed it to maintain it's position for awhile.
Another notable state occured 2,022
OYC
later than the previous notable state;  where it maintained a state for 12.32 seconds.  This is the 2nd longest that the variedverse has maintained one solid shape.  It's also noteworthy due to this being the first time it shifted into a 4 dimensional shape;  A petrial tesseract, to be exact.
The most notable state is likely when it suddenly became Ω-Dimensional, turning into an Apeirosphere.  This lasted for 172
voidseconds
, as opposed to the regular 1
voidsecond
.  This is the 18th longest that a singular state has existed.  This likely occurred when all entities fused into one, trying to escape, so it transformed temporarily to something that they couldn't escape.

Timeline

The variedverse has existed since long before even
The First Boom
, and likely is the first verse to exist, likely as a result of the
Pre-Primordial Boom
.  It used to only contain the
Primordial Speck
, but every entity that ended up being created ended up being contained here.
Interesting Variations of Entities
[
]
There have been more and more variations of several entities throughout the past couple million
OYC
.  Here's some of the most common and interesting ones.
Alphasm
[
]
While the
Alphasm
is not directly contained within this verse, all other variations and avatars of Alphasm are contained here.  This includes, but is not limited to;
Deleted Alphasms
Old Versions of Alphasms
Future Versions of Alphasms
Nonexistent versions of Alphasms
Etc.
Alphasm was likely one of the very first entities to appear in the Variedverse, and also likely one of the strongest.
Absolute
[
]
The
Absolute
, as well as deleted, old, future, and nonexistent versions of The Absolute all exist here.  There's also, notably, the Pre-Primordial entities, who were likely the very first entities to ever appear within this verse.
Marlthor
[
]
Marlthor is actually not a singular organism, but instead a hivemind, made out of all of the strongest entities, such as the
Transcendent Omni-Gods
.  It is not any stronger than aforementioned entities, but it is as intelligent as the sum of all of them combined.
