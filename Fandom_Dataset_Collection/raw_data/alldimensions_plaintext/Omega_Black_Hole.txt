Sentience
[
]
The Omega Black Hole is sentient, and is the only example of a type of black hole to be even remotely sentient.  The Omega Black Hole has no remorse or emotion for any other being whatsoever.  However, the omega black hole has been slain before, by two things; The Omega-Light Beam, an ultra-powerful blinding plasma beam, and Omega Radiation, the most potent and deadly type of radiation ever.  However, even with those weapons, the omega black hole took multiple
OA
to be defeated.  The omega black hole is the living embodiment of the embodiment of pure chaos and destruction.  However, this does not mean it's the biggest.
Containment
[
]
Our Omega Black Hole has been sent to a huge
Unexistence
in one of the
Omega Voids
, which cannot be escaped from. It was placed here in order to stop the Omega Black Hole's destructive rampage, and also torture it through starvation and isolation as punishment.
