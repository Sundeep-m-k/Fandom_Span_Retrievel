Reaching the Limboverse
[
]
First, you have to enter a level 666
Le Jorino Area
.
Make sure you brought at least 2 galaxies with you. Go into the larger galaxy and go to a planet with life.
Go behind a geological structure at least 1 kilometer tall.
Quickly go to the 2nd galaxy. You have 10 minutes to get there.
In the second galaxy, eat something while within 4 kilometers of a star.
If done correctly, you should be transported into layer 1 of the Limboverse.
Layer 1
[
]
Layer 1 is a bland area that doesn’t have much accept large amounts of weird temperature changes in various places, as each square inch can have temperature ranging from 200 to 300 (f) and -120 to -230 (f), and the temperature of each square inch constantly changes. There are also large amounts of “ghost wind” that sucks out parts of your soul. A strange entity with no physical form sometimes uses telepathy to give people false information about their loved ones and other unpleasant messages.
Layer 2
[
]
Reaching this layer
[
]
To reach layer 2, you need to use telepathy to bully the strange entity to make it angry.
Find ghost wind moving at at least 20 km/h and stare directly into it. Weird ghostly images will appear.
Touch the ghostly images.
Whisper, “I pledge that my soul will be kept in the depths of the darkness”.
Your vision will be swirling. Head directly into the ghostly images.
You should end up inside layer 2.
The Layer Itself
[
]
It has much slower ghost wind and time is slowed down. Black smoke figures appear constantly. The entity no longer does anything, but ghostly images will appear constantly. The temperature is extremely cold, at -9,274,237,623,185ºC on average. Ghost wind sucks souls more, and you will have constant out-of-body experiences. A large, black smoky dot with glowing red eyes also lives here, and is immortal and sucks souls.
Layer 3
[
]
Reaching this layer
[
]
Touch a black, smoky figure during an out-of-body experience.
Move “upwards” (according to your point of view) away from the smoky figure.
Wait until the out-of-body experience ends, then find the immortal smoky dot within 5 minutes.
Before he sucks your soul, say “I am now your servant. I pledge to do whatever you want. Not my soul. Not our soul. Your soul.”
You should be eaten by the dot. Or, it looks like it. But you will actually find yourself in the final layer.
The layer itself
[
]
The ghost wind is massive and it’s below absolute zero. Time is very slow and black holes are everywhere. The out-of-body experience is always going on, as your body is actually destroyed. There is a bright, shining cow that exists here that is immortal and can be walked right through. Nothing else is here, although it is rumored that your sleep paralysis demon is also hiding here. Current research is finding that this is very likely, but isn’t proven.
Escaping
[
]
It’s very hard.
Layer 1
[
]
Make sure you aren’t being affected by telepathy.
Go into a black hole.
Don’t get stuck in it.
Escape the black hole through an obscure exit.
There is a very small chance that you may end up outside the Limboverse.
Layers 2 and 3
[
]
Layers 2 and 3 cannot be escaped. However, it is theoretically possible to get from layer 3 to layer 2. This method has something to do with the bright, shining cow. It has never been done, however, so it is unknown whether it is possible or not. Even if you do that, you can’t leave layer 2, so you’re still stuck. Or you would be, if it hadn’t been recently proven that you can do the layer 2 back to layer 1 transition.
Layer 2 to layer 1
[
]
Find some ghost wind blowing into a black hole.
Bring the black smoky dot into the ghost wind.
Lure the smoky dot into the black hole.
Have the black dot attempt to suck your soul while you are moving around at high speeds inside the ghost wind.
You might suddenly be blown out of layer 2.
Layer 3 to layer 2
[
]
Find your sleep paralysis demon.
Bring the sleep paralysis demon inside the shining cow while the cow is at the borders of layer 3.
Kill your sleep paralysis demon while both of you are inside the shining cow.
Head backwards while killing the sleep paralysis demon and still be in the shining cow and head towards the wall.
Once you reach the wall, attempt to head away from the wall.
The wall will suck you in and bring you back to layer 2, and your body is restored somehow.
Trivia
[
]
Layer 1 is harder to escape than the mines of slavery.
Layer 2 can only be escaped by gods that are on or above the 1st everything layer. Layer 3 can be escaped only by gods that are post-5th everything layer.
Despite technically being in the 1st everything layer, it is also actually located in the 7th everything layer.
It takes 10 hours for 1 mph ghost wind to take your entire soul.
The Smokey black dot is stronger than Ayzyen, and is MUCH stronger than any god below the 6th everything layer.
The strange entity from layer 1 is weaker than
Dunkey Kong
.
The shining cow is about 10x as strong as
BEAN MAN BUT AWESOME
