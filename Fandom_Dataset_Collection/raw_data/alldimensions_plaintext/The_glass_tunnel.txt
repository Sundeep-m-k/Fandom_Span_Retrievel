A
glass tunnel
is a giant tube made out of
Laserverses
used to transmit information between and to users on the
Omni network
.
Glass tunnels are hard to break through, as the glass they are made out of is actually a bunch of Laserverses which each have shields. However, there is a slim chance that a
lasercore
forcefully exits the shield, and if that happens, the lasercore may disrupt the information flow through its glass tunnel for usually a few minutes before the lasercore spontaneously transforms into information after some time.
A glass tunnel is able to regenerate itself. When the glass is broken or the glass tunnel is otherwise damaged, the information inside gets turned into glass and sticks to the broken glass, eventually repairing the glass tunnel fully.
A glass tunnel also usually winds and has many twists and turns, for overall safety, and because creators of the Omni network don't want the glass tunnel to be vulnerable to attacks and natural phenomena, so with the twists and turns, the glass tunnel becomes harder to navigate.
The size of a glass tunnel is usually so big, a Laserverse is the size of a
protoverse
compared to it.
