The
Plant of Greatness
is an absolutely enormous class-12 object that is built with
cells of greatness
. Several of these plants actually grow on the Plantet of Greatness, named for the fact that it has an abundance of these plants.
This plant behaves just as any every-day plant would, except it is MUCH larger, and its cells are powered by verses instead of actual organic cell parts.
There really is nothing special about the Plant of Greatness, other than its size, as it does not produce any fruit or give a home to creatures. It actually doesn't need to do these things, because there is 100% plant life on the Plantet of Greatness and 0% animal life on it. It has, however, evolved against the Death Dust on the
Plantet of Greatness
.
