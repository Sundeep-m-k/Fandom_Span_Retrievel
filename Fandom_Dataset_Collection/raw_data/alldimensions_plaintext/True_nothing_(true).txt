True Nothing
in its "truer" form is the idea of what is nothing relative to everything.
There are many
objects
that are much smaller than the usual
nothing
, but wiki pages are made about them, so they exist in a sense. If there is a page about something, then the true Nothing automatically is classified as nothing relative to that object, even if the opposite is written there.
Something smaller than a true Nothing existing destroys the fundamental meaning of their idea, so in the name of preventing this, all pages that are supposedly "smaller" will be entered into a list of structures that are simply below Nothing.
Any attempt to define the true nothing and present it will lead to the fact that the true Nothing will become nothing relative to this definition. Even this interpretation of true nothingness is too powerful and we will never understand how insignificant true nothingness is.
True Nothings are nothing to even
