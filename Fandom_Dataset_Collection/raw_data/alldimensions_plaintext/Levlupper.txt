Levluppers
are
entities
that increase in strength each time they level up. They are highly hostile, and every time they kill another entity they gain its powers and abilities, while also having its attributes added to theirs.
If an entityâ€™s strength is negative, strength is still gained by converting it into a positive version of itself that shares the same value but with a stupider version of math that still gives the Levlupper power (more research needed).
Each individual one can, technically, become one of the strongest entities in the
wiki
, as if a stronger entity is made they can just level up with the strongest entities below them until they can kill the next entity, although this will probably never happen.
Legit facts (examples)
[
]
If they kill an entity that has full access to the
core of everything
, they also gain full access to it.
If they kill
Ayzyen
, they will have an attribute that causes all
mines of slavery
that have had Ayzyen killed by them be destroyed if the Levlupper dies, but not immediately happening when Ayzyen dies because the Levlupper is now also considered the Ayzyen by the Wikiverse.
If they kill another Levlupper, they level up faster! They also gain double abilities from entities.
If they kill something that is the source of something, the Levlupper will now be the new source of that thing.
If they kill the
voidmaker
, they can give people voidmares.
Levluppers are generated in masses in random locations throughout the
hierarchy
every time a
Cosmic Zaaaaaaaap
happens. This is strange, since they have no apparent connection.
The Levluppers
cannot
become stronger than a
Transcendent Omni-God
, no matter how much they increase in power.
The strongest known Levlupper has surpassed the
5th everything layer
. It is still alive.
The second strongest known Levlupper surpassed the
2nd everything layer
, though it's no longer alive.
