The
Superclusterverse
is a
Universe
that has only one
supercluster
. The superclusterverse has the biggest supercluster in our
Multiverse
, that is estimated to be over 700 trillion light years long. The superclusterverse will continue producing stars and galaxies forever, as every black hole inside of it evaporated from Hawking Radiation, and dark matter does not exist here. The superclusterverse contains the mass of 0.2% of the Multiverse. The superclusterverse is a universe that malfunctioned, and caused it to stay the same size as a normal supercluster. After 500 trillion years of staying the same size, it grew rapidly, growing at about one universe per second. The rapid growth then stopped again. This will continue happening once every 500 septillion years.
