Stаr Clustеr
is a strange anomaly present in a single
Universe
with laws of physics very closely resembling that of the universe the
human
species resides in. The stars contained within the Stаr Clustеr seem to be
quadrillions
of years old, making it older than its containing universe, whose age is only ~5 billion years old.
Origins
[
]
The origins of the Stаr Clustеr are unknown. Since the Stаr Clustеr is older than the universe it is contained by, its origins are certainly in other, more ancient universes. The structure may have even come beyond its local
Multiverse
.
Extremely accurate records by ancient multiversal civilizations indicate that the Stаr Clustеr was not present in its universe before -3439
OYC
, 54 OD. However, there are no records of any civilization or entity forcing the Stаr Clustеr into its containing universe through its verse barrier, a process which could take hundreds of OD and would certainly be noticed. It is therefore unknown how the Stаr Clustеr ended up in its present location. Several hypotheses involving
Glitchonicite
have been proposed, although they are not convincing as Glitchonicite is exceedingly rare in interuniversal space and is only present much higher up in the hierarchy. The involvement of cosmic entities cannot be dismissed.
Strange properties

Physics becomes stranger and stranger the closer you get to the Stаr Clustеr, until they completely degenerate at around ~1,700 LY from the center of the structure, sending anything that crosses that point into
Unexistence
. However, electromagnetic radiation and physical matter from the Stаr Clustеr can reach outside observers. The reason behind the progressive degeneration in physics has been theorized for thousands of OYC. The role of Glitchonicite was ruled out in -1390 OYC.
