Mr Clean
[
]
Mr. Clean was hired in 1700 BC, his goal was to clean every single dirt spot in every verse, Mr. clean spent 3,000 years trying to achieve this, he DID achieve this but 3 seconds after that all the dirt spots started coming back which made him angry and that’s why Mr. Clean retired, where he now works at OXI Clean world.
Soap Guy
[
]
Soap Guy was hired right after Mr. Clean retired, his goal was as-well to clean every Dirt Spot in existence, but The Hyper Dream had made existence 10^18 times bigger than it was before, meaning it would of taken Soap Guy about, 10^22 years to clean every dirt spot. Soap guy realized that this wasn’t a good idea, so he tried to speed up the process by experimenting, then Soap Guy invented his ultimate creation, the “Bathroom Soap” which killed 100% of germs, and then Soap Guy cleaned every single dirt spot in 2 years. Soap guy wanted to give his creation to every civilization, Soap Guy built a Soap Mall in every corner of the universe and created clones that went by the name Soap Guy 2 - Infinite.
OXI Clean Master

Dwam’s final disciple, OXI clean master admired Soap Guy’s work and he wanted to build his own soaps, which failed because the Soaps always ended up killing 90% of germs. Instead, he made OXI clean which removed stains. I know, this is a pretty boring page but I made this to learn how to use editor better.
