Red
[
]
When a Hevv is red, it means they're moving very fast and are very unstable, to the point it can make them fall apart on the worst case scenarios.
Green
[
]
When they're green, they're undergoing a size change which can enlarge or shrink them randomly. They CANNOT become larger than a dentist / smaller than a
Hekc
, though.
Orange
[
]
A Hevv turns orange when they're underwater, and when this happens they can swell up to half the size of a dentist, meaning they can become even smaller than what the green state allows them to.
Blue
[
]
When they're blue, their temperature lowers to a great extent and they turn into an ice-like material. Increasing the temperature can get rid of this state.
