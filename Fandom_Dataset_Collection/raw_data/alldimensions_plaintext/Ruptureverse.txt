A
Ruptureverse
is a verse, whose
dimensional barrier is ruptured, shattered, broken or destroyed
.
The cause of this phenomena is mostly due to
immensely strong collisions
. Other causes include:
evaporation (extremely rare), black hole consumation, dimension shattering, liquifying, decomposition or even artificialy inflicted damage, mostly war
.
Ruptured dimensional barriers can serve as openings for civilizations to leave without needing to develop transdimensional technology, which can be positive and negative, in the sense that beings can leave before a universe ending scenario.
But, life in a multiverse is much more difficult than that in just a verse, with set laws and logic
.
