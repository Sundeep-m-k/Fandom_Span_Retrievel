! Multiple Issues
!
This article has multiple issues. It requires fixing or deletion if fixing is not to be done. Issues listed below.
1. Low quality article. This page is very short and contains a minimal amount of information.
2. Spelling and Grammar Issues. It has many grammatical issues, making it hard to read and painful to look at. Many words are used wrong.
3. Bad Formatting. This page has horrible formatting.
4. End All Be All. This is an EABA, and that is against the rules. it also violates leftunknown's first axiom of reality.

WAA WAA TOO MANY REDLINKS!!!
no picture ROFL
NOTE: This was a test if I could make a end to the Verses. You can move this to a blog post if you dont want a final verse as a thing but thats fine. Just dont delete.
The Final Verse.
[
]
The Final Verse (TFV for short) is a type of omnipotence nobody can withstand. Not a single thing can escape this verse as it is anything and everything. If you compare anything to it, it is worth smaller then the smallest thing in this wiki by [UNDEFINED] times.
The Final Verse.
Scale
Dimensions
Its dimensional size is beyond definable, futuristic, unimaginable and incomprehensible. it will always be bigger and its dimensional size is growing by [UNDEFINED] times anyways so it wont matter.
Size
[UNDEFINED]x the size of the 2nd largest thing, which nothing deserves to be the 2nd largest thing.
Kardashev Scale
[UNDEFINED]. (Always growing)

Nothing can contain this Verse. It is beyond mathematical sense so nothing will be bigger.

It's True Size, Explained.
[
]
It is unable to purely calculate it's size. Because The Final Verse is anything and
EVERYTHING.
The Absolute Infinitieth Looped Lesser Ãœ
is the theorectical largest thing but still 0.0000...(UNDEFINED)...00001% of the way but even if it was 99.99...[UNDEFINED]....999999%, you can still add a [UNDEFINED] verses between that and this.
Who created this?
[
]
It created it self.Well, no it didn't but that creator is
Itself
. Literally, Itself, can't be bigger then it, though its journey is slightly faster then how TFV is growing. Itself is currently 0.000000000000000000...(xAleph-Twenty Seven).....000128947581243748658685419% oh wait now its 0.0000...(xAleph-Twenty Seven minus )......000000012894758124374865868542% the way there. With a definable number, you know Itself has got progress, but still, an infinite amount of things are in between Itself and TFV.
A new type of Verse.

Beyond this point, there is a reason nothing is bigger. Not a Verse, not a Loop nothing, TFV is smaller and bigger then itself, make something 1 meter larger, it will be 2. Make something 1 meter smaller, TFV does 2 and if something is 10%, TFV is 9.99999...%
So I present to you:
Graphs.
It system as follows (it skips ALOT of graphs):
Unigraph
Multigraph
Omnigraph
The Storage Unit (The Box)
The Looped Unigraph
The 2nd Looped Unigraph
The Aleph-Nullth Looped Unigraph
The Absolute Infinitieth Looped Unigraph
The Paradox Unigraph
GigaParadox Unigraph
YottaParadox Unigraph
OmegaParadox Unigraph
OmniParadox Unigraph
OmniOmegaParadox Unigraph
Themselve
The Final Graph.
A Graph is so big, so large, The Final Verse. can't contain it. This is the reason it is called "The Final Verse." not because it is and will be the largest thing in history. But because it literally
is
the final verse. anything that TFV can't cope will be called a
Graph
.
History
[
]
Itself was the first thing
EVER
. It made Graphs, entities, universes etc. But Itself wanted to make something so huge, it is bigger then itself, it tried for 0 second and BOOM the first of everything was made, and more of those were made in 1.0e-10^10^SSCG(TREE(BIGFOOT(Rayo(3)))) seconds. TFV was made. It was like how someone made a chess A.I. and can't beat it.
Continuing After This Point.

You should go to The
Unigraph
as comparing this to that is like comparing The Corona-Borealis Great Wall to the Obsevable Universe. Good Luck as you aren't escape until
Itself
does. Oh and by the way, beyond here, almost no photos will be taken and you would need to be in something larger then a
Unigraph
to take a photo of The Final Verse.
