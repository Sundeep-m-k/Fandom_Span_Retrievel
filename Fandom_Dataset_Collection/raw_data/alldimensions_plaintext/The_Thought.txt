The Thought is an extremely invasive, manipulative, nigh-omnipresent parasite able to manifest itself in other creatures if the creature mentions The Thought in any way or form. If the creature is under control of The Thought, The Thought is able to do whatever it wants with its new avatar, sometimes simply destroying it for its own survival.

The Thought, as mentioned earlier, is able to control any entity which mentions it. The Thought can also inhabit multiple entities, although if its consciousness is spread across too many avatars, it will lose control of all of its hosts and become formless and powerless again. Due to this, The Thought rarely targets entire civilizations and instead chooses to first take control of a relatively powerful entity and force the entity to attract the attention of stronger gods, thus allowing The Thought to control the stronger entity and become stronger via inhabiting that entity.
However, The Thought is limited in the fact that very powerful entities can possibly fight back against The Thought, not allowing the entity to take control. Because of this, The Thought usually has no chance of controlling gods which are beyond the Omniverse, and instead chooses to just cause havoc among civilizations in the Omniverse and below.
How the entity survives
[
]
The Thought survives by consuming the consciousness of other entities. Entities which display a higher level of self-esteem and/or are more capable can supply The Thought with more energy than a weak, egoless entity does. The Thought, with every meal, grows slightly stronger, and if The Thought becomes strong enough to overpower all other gods, The Thought is completely unstoppable.
The Thought has a weakness where if The Thought's current host it has manifested itself in has been destroyed, The Thought will lose much of its power. Because of this, The Thought will usually exit/destroy its host if it is being attacked.
How to stop The Thought
[
]
It is incredibly difficult to erase The Thought, and many inventions have been developed which have been claimed to make a creature immune to The Thought, although all of them have failed. As of the current
OYC
, there is no real way to stop The Thought, although as most creatures do not know of The Thought, they have a 0% chance to be invaded by it.

Another Verse

The Thought seems to have a relationship with
Not A Void
, as both verses share similar properties (with
Strange Verse
and The Thought both able to mess with entities who mention them). One theory is that The Thought is what allows
Impostor
to be able to drag entities to its incinerator.
