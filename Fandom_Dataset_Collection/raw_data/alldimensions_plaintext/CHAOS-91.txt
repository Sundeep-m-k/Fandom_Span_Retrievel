CHAOS-91
is a
ΔT star
located at the center of the CHAOS star hypercluster, located 600 trillion light years away from the Sun. With a mass of 1.5x10^16 solar masses, a brightness of 1.5x10^30 solar luminosities, and a temperature of 8.7x10^21 Kelvin, it is one of the most luminous stars in our multiverse. It has an apparent magnitude of 13.5, allowing it to be seen with a small to moderate sized telescope.

Visibility
[
]
In the night sky, CHAOS-91 appears as a faint object in the constellation Orion. With a magnitude of 13.5, a telescope is needed to view the star. The star can be seen throughout the Northern Hemisphere all night every day, if conditions permit.
Surroundings
[
]
CHAOS-91 is located at the very center of the CHAOS star hypercluster. The hypercluster contains an estimated 1.2 million stars and an unknown amount of planets all orbiting around CHAOS-91. The closest star orbits at a distance of 2 light years, while the furthest orbits at 56 trillion light years.
CHAOS-91 is located near the center of the Okis Universal Void. This means that the star is relatively unobsucred, resulting in an almost negligible visibility decrease.
Properties
[
]
Some scientists have argued that since the CHAOS star hypercluster orbits around the star, that the hypercluster isn’t a star cluster at all, but rather, CHAOS-91 is a 1.2 million star system. The legitimacy of these claims are under heavy debate.
Classification
[
]
CHAOS-91 is an ultra-high luminosity ΔT3 star, putting it at the extreme top left of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and in luminosity class -4 in the Yerkes spectral classification.
Mass
[
]
CHAOS-91’s mass comes in at 1.5x10^16 Solar Masses. Due to stellar wind speeds approaching the speed of light though, the star loses around 5 solar masses per year.
Luminosity
[
]
CHAOS-91 shines with the brightness of 1.5x10^30 solar luminosities, easily making it one of the brightest stars in the entire multiverse. It’s brightness from 10 parsecs (or it’s absolute magnitude) is currently unknown, and for the better, because even with a distance of ≈32 light years, it’s sheer brightness would be enough to atomize your entire body before somebody with the reaction speeds of a god would even realize the first sign  that they’re fucked.
CHAOS-91 supplies 40% of the brightness of the entire Okis Universal Cluster, and 99.999% of the CHAOS star hypercluster.
Size
[
]
CHAOS-91 is an estimated 61,000 times the radius of the sun, corresponding to a volume nearly a quintillion times larger than the sun. This gives the star a calculated density of 2.235x10^10 kg/m
3 holy fuck that’s as dense as your mom and how has it not collapsed into a black hole yet
Rotation
[
]
CHAOS-91 rotates at a rate of 1 rotation per 50 hours.
Future
[
]
CHAOS-91 is estimated to go teranova in the next 500 million years, creating a teramassive black hole millions of light years in diameter, and forming a nebula the size of a Milliverse.
