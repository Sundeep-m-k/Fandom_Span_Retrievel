Natural Position

Universe
Contains
some small verses
Scale
Diameter
diameter of box x -1
This verse is TINY! it is so tiny that even the protoverse is bigger! it is the same size as the box but negative! now how is it so tiny?
It is tiny because it started at 0 meters but went in the opposite direction. then someone named phil decided to push it downward so now its as large as the box but negative sized!
what it contains
[
]
it contains everything but a single cheeseburger. just kidding it actually contains a bunch of negative sized things as well as some universes.
these universes smell like french fries because they were tossed into the fryer by someone named ethan because he was trying to fry his sausages but he accidentally put the universes there as well and he didnt see them.
structure
[
]
the structure of this verse used to be one dimensional. someone named sam tried to turn this positively sized but the experiment paused a bit because he went to go milk a cow so the experiment never finished. instead this verse became 400,000,000,000 dimensional.
this verse contains itself an infinite amount of times but in the negative direction. it is located in the
2
ω
{\displaystyle \frac{2}{\omega}}
th dimension because that dimension allows this verse to be possible.
also it smells like lettuce
