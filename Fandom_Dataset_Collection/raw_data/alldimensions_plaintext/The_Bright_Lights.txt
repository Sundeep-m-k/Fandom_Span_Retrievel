The bright lights are an existential threat to basically everything. They can be activated by closing eyes and hoping that you see them, if you don't then just start over until you see them (please don't.)
when active, they are said to destroy everything but we don't know what happens next.
scientists have discovered that these are actually real things that are in an actual location but they have yet to pinpoint where. there are 3 candidates but they will not be listed.
they were discovered by Szemtelen Mano after closing his eyes a lot and then seeing the bright lights.
turns out that every living being is shielded by something to not see these and instead imagine total darkness when eyes are closed but sometimes it won't work and this causes the bright lights to be seen.
the bright lights do not move unless someone is seeing them.
