A
Dodecaplex
is not a polyhedron but a
polytope
. A Dodecaplex works like a
Dodecahedron
but instead of binding Universes it binds other Dodecahedrons to create colossal cosmic structures.
Formation
[
]
Dodecaplexes form when a sufficient amount of
Dodecahedrons
(around 120) start adjusting themselves into shape via gravity bonds (gravity bonds are bonds of gravity) forming the vertices of the Dodecaplex. The edges will then immediately form from the gravity bonds being stable enough. The dimensionality of all the
Dodecahedrons
then adds up giving the Dodecaplex a dimensionality of 24.
Behavior/Properties
[
]
The Dodecaplex cant only create structures but destroy them. Because the Dodecaplex exists in way higher dimensions than other cosmic structures it can rip them apart. If a Dodecaplex passes through a
Metaverse
it can dramatically change the structures or destroy structures within the
Metaverse
. There are a lot of Dodecaplexes but they all are mostly idle so they do not move at all.
A property of the Dodecaplex is that it can create new matter. So when one of the
Dodecahedrons
at one of the Vertices gets removed the matter created by the Dodecaplex can create a new one.
