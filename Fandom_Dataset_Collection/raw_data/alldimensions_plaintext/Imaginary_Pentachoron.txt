Imaginary Pentachoron
. One of 4D imaginary polychora variants. This variant is more complex than
Imaginary Tetrahedron
. This object is more bigger than a
Omniverses
and
The Boxes
, even bigger than a
Cetaverses
. Due dimension of Imaginary Pentachoron, it can't contain
Imaginary Energy
.

What if it had contained Imaginary Energy?
[
]
If a Imaginary Polychora had contained imaginary energy, a imaginary polychora will get glitched with 3D and 4D shapes. Some of them may be unknown 3.5D imaginary polychorohedrons.

The Formation
[
]
Pre-Formation
[
]
Imaginary Pentachorons form from polychora energy that takes over a 4D pentachoron, creating them.
First 1 Second of Formation
[
]
When a imaginary pentachoron forms, choratoms and choraquarks form. Choraquarks start form, at 10
-39
seconds after formation. Then choratoms start form at 10
-32
seconds after the formation.
First 1 Minute of Formation
[
]
After choraquarks and choratoms form fully, matter start taking over imaginary pentachoron. After 10 seconds of formation, matter getting more and more taking over imaginary pentachoron.
First 1 Day of Formation
[
]
After 60 seconds from formation, matter fully taken over imaginary pentachoron. 100 seconds after formation, inflation started. After 1 hour from formation, imaginary pentachoron start becoming darker. After 2 hours from formation, imaginary pentachoron start becoming colder.
Very Early History
[
]
1 Day - 1 Year after formation
[
]
After 1 day from formation, imaginary pentachoron becoming at current darkness, but it have 1000℃  temperature. After week from formation, temperature reached 15℃. After 10 months from formation, inflation ends.
Note: More than 1 year after formation is unknown.
