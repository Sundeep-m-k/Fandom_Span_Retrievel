Yharon's Message to
Yharim
after seeing The Truth Seeker, Oblivion
[
]
The enemy ascended beyond your control, Or was that all your intention? They have managed to demolish whatever we made, But you're failing to comprehend... If they can, they will easily butcher you whole, While you're blinded by your depression. I have gotten to the point where I'm just too afraid That you're going to meet your end. My screams echo out through the fire, And your rival dares stand in my way. Yes, this is a hardship most dire, And one day, you will heed what I say: This is my message to my master: This is a fight you cannot win. I think that past your great disasters, Their victory stirs below your skin. If you proceed, I will not blame you; I will move forth and win your war. But if I should die before you continue, You shall have heard my final dying roar.
