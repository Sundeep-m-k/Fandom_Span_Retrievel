The Inaccurate Rating Person is a person who got really lucky during
The Championship
and managed to gain the ability to judge anything in The Box. While he doesn't have the ability to change anything in them, everyone just believes what he says and switches to his own opinion, while keeping the verse he judged intact if it has a high score and changing it and improving it if he gives it a low score.
However, the problem is he always gives every single thing a perfect score with no reason. Therefore, everything that he judges remains completely the same because of his opinion and everyone just believes him every time.
His name is actually Bob, but everyone calls him Inaccurate Rating Person because there is already someone called
Bob
.

Why he rates everything a perfect score
[
]
When he was first created, there was a substance called muhfhgrhive put into his head by a doctor that changed the way he thought about things. For a while, he would miss obvious things, but also notice really revolutionary things that most people would not notice. This changed the way he thinks, so he believes that positivity is the answer to everything which is why he gives everything a perfect score because he believes he is doing the right thing.
Also, this substance allowed his head to be morphed like clay, so he changed it to a pentagram for an unknown reason.
The Accident
[

After the muhfhgrhive was put into Inaccurate Rating Person's head and his head became flexible, it slowly spread to his body after a few years and his body was flexible as well. However, he accidentally fell down and took his body off, but it's fine because all of his stuff is in his head now and he doesn't need the body. Therefore, he just turned into a floating star that could move around.
This state was what he was in when he got lucky in The Championship, and after he became the Inaccurate Rating Person, people thought he was cool because he didn't have a body but he didn't like it because it made him uncomfortable so he wanted to get a body again. He requested for it to be a weird material that is said to be the average material of
The Box
but with the amount of salt amplified. That's why his body is made of that material, but one arm is slightly longer than the other due to a mistake. He thought the material choice was interesting and he likes salt so he amplified the salt.
How he got lucky in The Championship
[
]
Due to how random and arbitrary The Championship is, Inaccurate Rating Person just happened to be one of the people who did really well in it and was announced the role of a thing judge which can rate anything in The Box. However, the host of The Championship has a really high reputation so everyone trusts him and it was the host of The Championship who announced Bob's new role so everyone started listening to him, despite the strange choices he makes. This is why everyone listens to Inaccurate Rating Person. The Championship has been manipulating people and his role is a part of it.
Drawbacks
[
]
One of the verses that Inaccurate Rating Person judged with a perfect score is the
Negationverse
. There was an ongoing debate about removal of that verse, but then he said it was a perfect verse that didn't need adjustments and then nothing happened to it because of how much people trust the host of The Championship. This is why the Negationverse still exists. It is his fault, and it is also his fault that everyone hears Super Paper Mario OST after a
QuirkVerse
incident happens.
There have been multiple other things that he has unnecessarily kept up, such as many horrible creatures from the second
Physical Realm
.

Despite his way of giving everything a perfect score, he decided to publicly announce that he doesn't like the measure of intelligence that is IQ, even though he likes everything else. It is unknown why he said this.
