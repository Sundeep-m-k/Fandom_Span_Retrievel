Relative to time, a
law
is a dynamic
axiom
defining how differing types of matter behave under a
Verse
, spatial region, or another law. Laws are recursive and typically dynamic; a larger law container can control a smaller law container's composition, as laws and matter are both a form of information.
Laws can be partitioned into two domain restrictions: a limit on the matter that can be controlled (i.e.
Existence Rank
), and a spatial boundary (i.e.
Archverse
). A verse’s size can be determined as the reach of its spatial boundary or
area of influence
, which,
most commonly a sphere
, is a region of space where the
laws
of the verse govern that region. In practically all cases, it ends instantly upon contact with the verse’s barrier.
How strongly laws are enforced is interpreted via the
Eisler value
.
Universal Law
[
]
When a
Universe
is naturally created, it is automatically assigned a set of
laws
, which are determined by the form of creation and what happened during it.
For example
, when two Universes collide together to form a new Universe, the
laws
of this new verse are determined upon the exact moment of collision. What those
laws
will be is determined by the
speeds, sizes, masses, all laws, rotational speeds, accelerations, constants, distributions of matter and forces of both Universes and the
Multiverse
superior to it
. There are many, many more other characteristics, that change the outcome of the collision, but those are some main examples.
