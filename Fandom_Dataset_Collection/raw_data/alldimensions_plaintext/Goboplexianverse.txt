Rainbow color
[
]
The goboplexianverse's "rainbow" color is not light. That's all we know.
Hyperbolic spaces
[
]
This verse is in a hyperbolic space, so it is impossible to walk around it all the way. The reason for its "hyperbolicness" is because of
[REDACTED]
and
[EXPUNGED]
.
Galaxies
[
]
For some unknown reason, the galaxies show up on the outside when there in the inside, which is weird. They are also in the shape of hexagons, and don't ask why, as we don't know why.
Facts about gobocomputers
[
]
They destroy you if you use incognito mode.
Even though they have so much power, even the strongest ones are unable to calculate π.
They are always blue, and don't ask why...
Each one has exactly 10 goboantennas.
Each one needs to have to have 5 goboservings of gobobattery acid and gobopizza each goboday, nothing else, nothing more, nothing less.
Every gobocomputer is shaped like a klein bottle with the goboscreen on the bottom
You don't use gobocomputers, gobocomputers use you.

Giygas loves this place and goes here for vacation.
There is a gobovirus known as "CoVid-θ" (also known as CoVid-Theta) that explodes the lungs (or gobolungs) soon after initial infection, which is a matter of only a couple gobominutes.
