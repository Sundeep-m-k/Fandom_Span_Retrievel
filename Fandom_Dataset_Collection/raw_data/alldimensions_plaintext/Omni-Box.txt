The

are one of the biggest structures in almost any

This massive structure is at the heart of the
Clocks
, which are one of the essential finality-based containers.
Use
[
]
This structure is essential to the stability of their Clocks, containing the majority (but not all) of finality-3 objects. If these
verses
didn't exist, most Clocks would be overflowing with objects, causing immense chaos.
If these verses used euclidean geometry, they would be overflowing with verses and objects, causing their destruction. However, the Omni-Boxes make use of an infinite amount of pocket dimensions, curves space, and creates smaller self-containing objects.
Due to the properties of the Clocks, anything beyond this is very unexplored and dangerous to travel through.
Self-Containment
[
]
The Omni-Boxes contain themselves in a fashion similar to that of
Boxes
. However, they're so big that they not only do the length of the function needed to express the size infinitely long, but its sheer size causes space to warp around it's edges and center, creating many pocket dimensions and self-containing objects. All of the
Official
and
Extended
hierarchies are contained within the biggest pocket dimensions.
