The Structure Complex is a structure that goes even further than
Unboxed
's reality states; at this level there are now
Megastructures
, which can have varied containment structures without being limited to only
Boxes
.
Box
-Like Structures
[
]
Due to the random nature of verse containment within the Structure Complex, large looping structures of containment are common. These loops can also have many sub-loops, and are typically larger chains.
Sometimes however, this type of structure can grow at uncontrollable rates due to infinite loops in containment. This causes Box-like structures to be the most common type of object in the Structure Complex.
Reverse Tree Structures

Additionally, with verses similar in nature to the
Boxial Core
, the verse can be contained by multiple verses at the same time without those verses overlapping. This sounds impossible, but the Boxial Core can allow for one verse's containment to be "activated" via fluids, adding a control system.
If
Boxial Core
-like verses are not present however, particles that leave verses contained within multiple verses end up scattered into pieces. This typically makes verses lacking a Boxial Core not last long.
Archverse
Structures
[
]
This is the least common type of structure, due to the heavy amount of order required and/or a small group of verses. This category consists simply of a chain of one
Verse
containing another Verse over and over, until the smallest verse or the Structure Complex is reached. Due to being smaller and more organized, these structures last the longest, making up for their low ability to form.
