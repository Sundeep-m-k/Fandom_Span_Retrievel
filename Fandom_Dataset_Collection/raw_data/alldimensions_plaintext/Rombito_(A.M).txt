A.M Rombito (the “Absolute mortal”) used to have a verse, but it self-destructed due to it being unable to handle the power of its own inhabitants. He was the only one that survived. The absolute mortal is now fictic.
The reason he is titled the absolute mortal is because he has so much power for a mortal.
He had the ability of his power slowly increasing a certain fraction of the maximum, but since there is no maximum in FictoSpace, His power suddenly went haywire, he almost immediately got used to it due to said power
The power in question when not holding back
[
]
he can move so fast that it shakes and scrambles both nothingness (the absence of matter) and 1/4 of the Entire FictoSpace.
if he moves a Planck length he would cause a shockwave that would devastate every thing in a radius of 50 quintillion large fictoSpacial verses.
