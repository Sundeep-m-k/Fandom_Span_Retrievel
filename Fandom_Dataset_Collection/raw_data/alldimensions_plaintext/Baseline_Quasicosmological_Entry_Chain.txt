preface
[
]
this page shows many arbitrarily picked baseline quasicosmological entries which are part of a chain. linguistic description is simplification and understatement. in between the listed verses there are of course vast cosmologies etc consisting of more entries than are between the common contained object within the OCT and
The Layerium
/
THE.
remember all this shit is hard 2 explain and write down without just hilariously downplaying it just member that its all understatement like the description of THE. this is longer and bigger than it appears by a lot. and reminder that stuff b4 quasicosmology is already viewing everything below them as fiction except they can pseudoscript the nonanyscriptable
"entry" means the same thing as verse and object, except that those terms are no longer applicable here due to the scale (another term which is inapplicable at this "level") of these entries. this page will look like
Bullshit Cosmology.
a listed entry does not need to be truly listed, only said to be listed in some extent.
Pincel 3-4 (Level 1)
[
]
just getting started now
all listed things here are surpassed by another insane amount of listed chains and loops, which are themselves surpassed by an even larger insane amount of listed chains and loops etc, and even more all le way down ridiculously vastly non any scriptably (beyond that) its cray and incomprehensible 2 extreme fake extents (boundlessly and beyond boundlessly) (except donutentry chain)... its all interrupted by more shits than are listed every time.
donutentry chain
[
]
donutentry chain is a chain of 9,384,561,227 listed entries that are all functionally similar to THE on an abstract higher "level", each being a vastly greater jump in "scale" than absolutely every"thing" before them.
final donut entry
[
]
the final donut entry is the true end of the donutentry chain. the succeeding listed entry to this is the first entry of the bongulong chain.
bongulong chain
[
]
bongulong chain is a chain of
ζ
ϵ
1
{\displaystyle \zeta_{\epsilon_1}}
listed entries that are all functionally similar yet vastly superior to the final donut entry on an abstract more significantly higher "level", obviously superseding all massive lower jumps in "scale".
the loops
[
]
the loops are a great series of loops that go on for
Genuine Forever.
they loop the entire GOCT (fake) beyond the OCT up to this point, each on an even more significantly vaster "level" than everything before. they themselves are looped by a subsequent further
θ
{\displaystyle \theta}
greater copies of the loops.
loop chain chain chain loop loop chain chain loop loop loop chain
[
]
this is a group of loops and chains beyond the loops. its entry count is inexpressible and truly fake, because it is truly endless beyond any form of endlessness up 2 now.
greater loops
[
]
greater loops are further loops beyond LCCCLLCCLLLC. the entry count of the greater loops is inexpressible yet ever expanding through real time in ways similarly truly absolutely inexpressible through anything producible to any capacity in real life.
autoloop
[
]
autoloop is almost huge.
autoloop
2
[
]
autoloop
2
is huge.
last autoloop
[
]
last autoloop is insane.
Level 1 End Series
[
]
level 1 end series is an extremely long series of chains and loops and other things that are absurd.
to surpass the level 1 end series and reach level 2 many things must be done like repeat everything before a bunch of times and copies and shit all that stuff just lots of loops even after level 1 end series that culminate in final entry of level 1 of quasicosmology
Wey Part (Level 2)
[
]
level 2 is so ridiculously and inanely gargantuan compared 2 level 1 and all the listed levels in between level 1 and level 2 that it just makes everything look smaller than the inverse of the fake GOCT beyond the OCT which is fake but still cap at level 1 because this is too big for any extension of the OCT or GOCT
weyland
[
]
weyland is an even more insane series of series of... series of loops, chains, and many other things. its largest listed member is weyland carp, which is an entity and an entry
divine weyland
[
]
divine weyland is weyland but its really stupid and bigger or something idk
weyworld
[
]
weyworld is even more eaba shit but its largest listed member is world props so its called weyworld
whatever else
[
]
whatever else is the end of wey part (level 2). it is just the alt name for its end series.
Cog Poles (Final Level)
[
]
this is the final level of many. too many to explain it at all. just crayer than cray. craw even.
higher fictional stack
[
]
more cray version fictional stack that go cray cray sizes yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeg
cog bog
[
]
cog bog is the domain of curger
fin fold and soy saw
[
]
highest entry: curger complex
this chain goes on for LONG, and it cant be explained here how long LONG is.
It's still contained by
The BIGGEST Entry Chain
.
