Contained by
Absoverse
generated by the surface of the
Absoverse
is great enough to make the
Puiettabverse
seem "stuck" to the floor.
It becomes unstuck once the
Blaychamaverse
rings,
then
, it begins to
roll in a circular motion, powered by soundwaves generated by the vibrations of the echoing bell and rattling
Absoverse
. It takes an entire OYC for the verse to end its motion, upon which, it will
abruptly haste to the rock bottom and rest until the next calling
.
The rolling sound is interpreted as a
call for attack
, then, all major life in the
Absoverse
will seek refuge in so-called "
pocket-dimensions
", the order in which they hide in these random forgotten dimensions is
uninterpretable and impossible to comprehend to the primitive mechanical beings who attempt to annihiliate everything in their path
.
The major life will take all of its "children verses", aka, verses that it
contains or are smaller than itself
, into with them, usually for an entire OYC, due to the attacker foolishly scouring the
Absoverse
to find even the
slightest resemblance of life
.
