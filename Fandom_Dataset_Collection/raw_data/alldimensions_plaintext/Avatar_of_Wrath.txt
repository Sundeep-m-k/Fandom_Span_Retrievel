Avatar of Wrath is a fairly tall (1.9 meter tall) handsome terratomere (a species of dragon) with golden scales with various green platings located on places around his body. He has a very encouraging, hopeful, and cheerful attitude, albeit he sometimes acts a little childish, though usually resolving, when in conflicts.
Zenitherium, Exotic Variant Paragon Form Avatar
[
]
After spending more than a year in the
Incrementyverse
, a simulated evolutionary universe created by Patcail that was designated as a safe-haven and refuge spot for the remaining members of Avatar's civilization and allies, Avatar has developed his previous paragon form into an exotic variant. Zenitherium is an exotic variant or coveted species of the family of reality warping draconic life-forms dragoons. Zenitheria are relatively scarce, as only the most prestigious dragoons are capable of transitioning into this species. However, a lot of Zenitheria are created in the Incrementyverse due to the accelerated/tetrated technological growth the incrementyverse was designed to simulate. Zenitheria are notorious for nearly exceptional in combat and development. Most species come nowhere near as close as adept as Zenitheria in terms of overall abilities and effectiveness. Their power comes from their ability to gain new stats, powers, and hax at sub-pentational rates, usually by assimilating the abilities of defeated opponents, environmental surroundings, researching on new moves and learning them, or even by being exposed to new combat techniques and exotic matter. Their boundless durability, resilience, courage, and willpower only further allows them to prevail in tough combat. Power levels of a zenitherium range between

(

{\displaystyle \psi(\Omega^\Omega)}
and
ψ
(

{\displaystyle \psi(\Omega^{\Omega^\omega})}
which put them at High-Universe level in attack potency. However, they are technically only Multi-Solar System Level at best due to them not having enough destructive capacity, AOE, and they can be killed by sufficient blunt force if they have no exotic matter weaves or aegises protecting them.
As a zenitherium, Avatar gained an near unrivaled ability to adapt, regenerate, and mimic the moves of fought opponents and allies.
