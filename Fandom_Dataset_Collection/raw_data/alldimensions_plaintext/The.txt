Being The one who controls The universe known as
The Omni-Omni

The
The
is a fantastic entity with a form for human mids that is extremely underwhelming, a couple of the word 'The' in The Asap Font on a black background.  Its true form was only seen once by Marvelo The Hairy.  "It looked like a cross between a giant ape and The yelling nine-year-old you saw that one time you went to KFC," he states.
It's life only depends on it controlling The Omni-Omni.  The is rather stupid, he couldn't pass a first-grade science quiz.  It lives in peace, in The only land he calls home,
THE the
.
It only attacks beings you trespass its territory in THE the.  The grows giant claws and tries to stab you with them, and can only stop if you state that you pronounce The like Thee.  Beware of this monstrous entity. It somehow contains
The Omni-Omni
. One theory for this is that it somehow swallowed The Omni-Omni some time ago.
The is the enemy of
