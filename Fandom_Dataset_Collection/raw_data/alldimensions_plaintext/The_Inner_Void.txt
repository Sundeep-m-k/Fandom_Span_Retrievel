Between The Particle and hypercluster, there is a "bewilderingly cold" void that has shape of dodecahedron symmetry because weird probabilistical pulsation of hypercluster. Void takes up around 95% inner space of The Particle (rest is of course taken by hypercluster).

⌬ Wth hypercluster take up 5%
[
]
Well, the reason why hypercluster (which is transinfinitely smaller than inner void) can take up 5% of this huge void is because void has weird geometry of space and time. I did not really explain why this is the case in hypercluster page (or it was The Particle page. IDK! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯), so I will precisely explain it here.
First, you better read "
Types of voids
" part because there will be some mentions about types of voids. Ok the reason why this freak happens is this: from inside-hypercluster perspective, you perceive inner void as transinfinitely bigger than hypercluster. It is because hypercluster sort of "reflects" level 3&4 void and hypercluster barrier.
But from perspective in inner void, level 3 and 4 voids are none-existent, thus invisible (meaning that only level 1&2 voids are perceivable and experienceable). That is why I said something getting out of hypercluster only feels void a space few hypercluster diameter wide.
⌬ Wait why is Inner Void needed
[
]
Because hypercluster is likely to fall apart by immense energy of quantumverse if only
The Particle
was sustaining hypercluster. Void protecc the hypercluster from probability of destruction (the reason why The Particle entirely gets rid of probability of destroyed hypercluster) by being indescribably cold.
Imagine any big number and attach minus in front of it. It is temperature of void... approximately. That approximation won't be any good because at THIS scale of minus temperature, no imaginable minus number is useful. It is always not enough.
⌬ Is it really just empty?
[
]
The answer is yesn't. There is nothing inside voids, but there is ALWAYS something in it no matter how much you try to get rid of certain space. That single existing thing is void itself. It is because even none-existence voids exists as long as there is the space region of it, no matter how small it is. Also, like I will mention, even greatly empty voids interact in some way with outside world. And by that, we can tell something exists there, and it is void itself.
⌬ Types of voids
[
]
Basic info
Lv.1
Lv.2
Lv.3
Lv.4
Voids can be divided into four different region. Each have apex of weirdness that gets more weird as level of void gets from 1 to 4.
⌬Lv.1: Physical emptiness
[
]
Simply there is nothing that can be called matter or energy. This void is quite similar to vacuum of observable universe, where there is nothing that can affect outside world (of course you have to get rid of quantum fluctuations and bosons away to reach this level of emptiness). Sadly, this level of void is right next to hypercluster.
Hypercluster keeps inserting tremendous amount of existence to the void, and that incredible jump of existence level triggers everything original hypercluster space has, creating false existence. And you know what likes false existence very much? The supercluster seeds. Transinfinite amount of tiny supercluster seeds keep escaping from barrier of hypercluster polyhedron and blooms inside false existence.
As soon as supercluster blooms, the void go backs to false existence. But it is not a good move! it shatters superclusters and much of fragments have duality of existence and non-existence. That property allows fragments to vibe peacefully in Lv.1 void region.
Even though void tries to destroy them, the void only produces non-existence-destruction-resistence-particles
TM
. Those exotic particles ultimately concentrate around fragments of supercluster. Actually even better; it creates living star inside void region! Explanation about those "stars" are explained precisely at bottom tabber :3
⌬Lv.2: Realitical emptiness
[
]
If you travel little more to outer edge of physical emptiness void region, forces and fields themselves start to blur away. At Lv.2 void region, you find some fragments that were large enough to pass through Lv.1 void without being slowed down and stopped by countless explosions. Big enough fragments slowly turn their property to duality between realitical emptiness and existence without shattering.
This void region also tries to destroy leftover fragments, but that action of void only creates new star that cannot be extinguished even by shooting NOKIA3310 at it (NOKIA3310 can even destroy one supercluster when properly fired).
⌬Lv.3: Numerical emptiness
[
]
If you travel from Lv.2 void to little more outside, you will either bet bonked away (in extremely rare cases) or collide with "something" and be obliterated instantly. Congratulation, you just experiences Lv.3 void, the numerical emptiness region. Everything imaginable and unimaginable that can be described as numbers, are all zero!
If you try to solve formula (and also if you survive obliteration) or whatever mathematical, you will automatically get answer of zero! Even explosive formula like
f
ψ
(
M
(
M
(0;0);0))
​(10) will give result of zero, which is at least some good news for your computer. Math does not make sense in this region!
Because everything automatically resets to zero in here, fragments seems slowly disappear into oblivion because they are changing their duality. That reaction crushes fragment more and more, to infinitesimal, transinfinitesimal, ... to 0, nonexistent!
⌬Lv.4: Set-theoretical emptiness
[
]
Even non-existent adapted fragments cannot get in here. You know what is one important element of set discovered? it is empty set, and
even lacks zero
! This void lacks everything of set, including imaginables and unimaginables. And you know what, this void region also lacks empty set, so the void
lacks even a thing that lacks zero
!! This void does not make sense, so Ill just end this part with emoji :D
⌬ Inner void stars
[
]
Basic info
Weird stars of physical emptiness region
Weird stars of realitical emptiness region
Weird stars of numerical and set-theoretical emptiness region
As I described, fragments from destruction of superclusters (caused by void) disturb void from peacefully vibing around in space of nothingness. As a result, void tries to destroy the fragments. But sneaky fragments change their duality when they enter void, so void only builds up immense amount of weird material around fragments during trying to destroy them. That weird material is similar to D-gas, but much weird. Large enough nebula of them build stars.
⌬Stars

]
Picture is weird material nebula inside physical emptiness region collapsing onto fragment
This is most active region among other void regions. At here, "weird material" nebula is all over the void region. Those materials collapse onto fragment, slowing down their movement. But fragment is still moving with unstoppable speed, and blows away much of weird material surrounding it. Still, it gains more and more of it. Ultimately, some sort of friction slows down speed of fragment enough for spacetime web to envelop it.
After spacetime web envelopes fragment, the spacetime web explodes due to accumulating false existence. It somehow activates swirling force inside weird material, which annihilates weird material lump when it contacts with other lump of weird material. So these "stars" don't live by fusion reaction, but rather like huge antimatter reactor.
⌬Fra

These are most common types of stars in physical emptiness region. They have shattered fragment of superclusters as cores, and are
sus
tained by annihilation of weird material happening very close to core.
⌬Spectral type אָ

[
]
These stars are fresh and newborn stars burning their core very actively. Fresh fuel circulates around, delivering energy to entire system. Star expands as its equilibrium time gets close. After that, the star is very stable, just expanding a bit more each time core fragment cracks and immense amount of false existence stored in it discharges (it also generates flare capable of raising star's temp by infinite fold for a brief period).
⌬Spectral type אָ
1
[
]
Here, weird material's weight increases significantly due to dimensional radiation (which transfers not only D-magnetic force, but also mass) (that radiation also adapts to existence level just like fragment does), which cracks fragment more. Dimensional radiation from annihilation reflects off fragment core, and each time it reflects, the fragment loses tiny amount of duality each time.
Loss of duality narrows region where fragment's duality is able to keep weird material from being converted into false existence and explode because of void. As the safe region is narrowed, void's annihilation speed on weird material boosts.
⌬Spectral type אָ

[
]
Then when the core weird material is dissolved, the star undergoes total collapse. It draws all void around it. Briefly, so much false existence creates very, very tiny space with energy more than half of supercluster. Fortunately for void, false existence quickly absorbes energy and sends it out in form of ripple. That ripple fades as it travels through void, even though faded shockwave is still powerful enough to create false existence when it hits something.

phase is not the death of them. Shockwave from death of those stars push away void briefly. The pushed away void tries to resist, but because chonk stars release very long frequency shockwave, big bubble is formed at explosion site. In that bubble, fragment is damaged severely but still preserved. Around that, weird material that were flinged outside of bubble collects again.
Weird material is extremely expandable because it is supercompressed in process of avoiding annihilation. As soon as those tiny marbles of weird material enter safe bubble region, they expand, completely filing the bubble. Bubble even manages to grow itself via expansion shockwave from tiny marbles.
⌬Spectral type בֵּ

[
]
Because the bubble allows star to reincarnate, void really hates it and wants to get rid of it A.S.A.P. So tug o war between bubble and void starts. At first, star's re-ignition with powerful shockwave coming from it allows star to win for a short time. But it soon runs out of shockwave, and formation of false existence is not stonk anymore. Void slowly destroys whole bubble again, and finally, a star inside it.
⌬Spectral type גִּ
[
]
For even more chonk stars, one more reincarnation chance is given again. If fragment survives explosion (only super chonk fragments inside super chonk stars can survive), phase בֵּ

repeats. But this time, false existence is more than enough to resist void; it wins the void! freak shockwave passes through void region and rips off existing parts of void, creating some sort of gradient between existence protection region and void region.
That gradient of course slowly disintegrates from collapse of void around it. End of this star is ultimate shattering of fragment and release of all energy inside it. This explosion is too powerful for void to absord like cushion. Well, huge boom! :P
⌬Stars
inside
realitical
emptiness
region
[
]
Sometimes, unusually active process inside hypercluster or physical emptiness region generate some weird fluctuations on realitical emptiness region. Or, if something is energetic or lucky enough, material from regions contained in physical emptiness region gets into realitical emptiness region. Many of the material is instantly obliterated, but some materials adapt duality and is able to survive.
⌬Seed
core
stars
[
]
The seed core star (do not eat)
From here, stars have only one spectral type (so single color), and what changes is their inner material, size, brightness, etc. It is because
plutfuse was lazy
surprising chonkness of star does not allow spectral types to change.
At right moment, EXACT right moment, seeds escaping from hypercluster barrier strikes one of fragment core star. And, with tremendous crash, seed violently replaces fragment core while fragment gets flinged out of existence bubble and destroyed.
In fact, crash is so tremendous that star is pushed away from its original location to realitical emptiness region. Under the protection of star, seed blooms inside safely (because star core constantly produces false existence of itself). Star manages to get protected by seed, but the force field is unstable.
As I described in
supercluster
page, the supercluster has ordinal absolute infinite amount of variations contained in it, just not showing all of it to outside. Well, in this case, juice of star is fed into supercluster, rising its variation numbers. Imaginable, unimaginable, and something weird start to variate inside supercluster. Variation numbers reach ordinal transinfinite.
Now, you can notice that something is wrong with the star; as it expands a little and that layer instantly explodes outward (the picture is seed core star at that phase). As soon as star tries to change its spectral type, in an instant, supercluster releases smallest ordinal transinfinite amount of variations which all shatter and converted to star's juice. The juice released keeps star from changing its spectral type.
When star becomes heavier, supercluster releases more and more variations. It overdrives the star, and yeets it as soon as tiny inbalance of juice increase of star (caused by supercluster) and core pressure goes yeet to indescribable level. At that point, supercluster releases evry variationsat once. Ofc, explosion. But it isnt ordinary explosion, the shockwave is indescribably powerful. It bounces off between The Particle and hypercluster, raising energy level of whole system by undetectable fraction.
⌬Duality
core
stars
[
]
Typical duality core star (also do not eat)
Duality core, as I mentioned in supercluster page, is a center of The Box galaxy cluster, where many box galaxies are concentrated. It is second most powerful object in hypercluster (I also mentioned that everything inside supercluster can also exist at hypercluster space), and in some cases where it absorbs juice of star, it engulfs entire supercluster. So, this star is little weird variation of seed core star.
Duality core stars first come to existence when chonkness of star is too big for supercluster to not shatter. Star's transinfinite juice
TM
is immediately fed into all objects inside superclusters. Every holes and stars go transinfinite party, but the ultimate winner is duality core. It soon eats every other objects with unapproachable growth rate.
With that, star's color is determined to be red (although temperature is indescribably high). As soon as the duality core takes over, it stops expanding because it reached limit of growth (it evaporates away faster than absorbtion rate).
From now, duality core and the star is perfectly stable but of course eternal living is not allowed in my cosmology >:0 yeah so remember when I talked about dimensional radiation at hypercluster scale transfers not only D-magnetic force but mass too? That phenomenon ultimately becomes source of star' boom.
As the dimensional radiation from duality core rises mass of star, core is basically destroying itself. More mass compresses duality core until it yeets.
⌬Fractal co
re stars
[
]
Very unique fractal core star nebula with unusually high concentration
These stars have self-containing property, meaning that there are countless smaller copies of itself in it. What gives star this property is supercluster core somehow absorbing when supercluster shatters. So this star is some kind of spinoff of duality core stars.
Supercluster core naturally connects ordinal absolute infinity of supercluster variations. It also kind of "contains" all those variations inside the first layer (what is it? explained in "instability of supercluster" part of
this page
). Thus, it also self contains.
Star's juice possesses this power and creates bunch of itself inside supercluster core, which now contains smallest ordinal transinfinite amount of star's variations. How the star lives is quite brutal: it waits for inner copies of it to explode, and harvests that energy radiated from hypercluster.
Ofc, the star slowly runs out copies of itself as its energy consumption is too large for supercluster core to
sus
tain the star. Supercluster core kills more and more copies, but it soon all runs out. With incredibly huge boom, supercluster core now releases energy of copies of itself.
That shakes the star and raises star's mass by uncountable fold. This leads to supercluster core to keep itself from exploding by releasing more copies' energy of itself, but it only leads to overdrive of star. Star yeets (as it always has been) and this raises energy level more than explosion of duality core star.
⌬Void co
re stars
[
]
This is not cluster or something of void core stars; it is single void core star.
This star is one of most lowest density star in void region. It is overballooned even at its birth, kinda resembling dense sperical nebula with glowy explosions going inside it. How it is not falling apart is simple: it is barely held together by attraction, and has immense pressure at core which does not allow shockwave to disassemble the star.
I only explained weirdness of their shape, but how exactly do these stars live? Well, they literally contain tiny realitical emptiness void space inside it! This is caused by nebula of weird material collapsing in spherical shape while leaving tiny void region inside it.
Of course, reaction inside star core produces false existence. This violently reacts with void (because void really hates something with word "existence" with no "non" in its name. False existence kinda tricks the void so it reacts), and that energy balloons star to such size, making it quite transparent.
After star stabilizes a little, reaction similar to lava lamp begins. Superheated plume bubbles of weird material travels to inside void, being destroyed in luminous flash. It balloons star more until star yeets.
⌬Collapsing core stars
[
]
Also not a cluster of collapsing core stars, it is common binary collapsing core starsTwo stars are located where two powerful jets come out.
Collapsing core stars are even more less dense than void core stars and is reincarnated void core stars. Insane ballooning of void core star also balloons inward. It compresses void more and more, until void slowly starts to collapse itself. In the process of collapsing, void constantly gives away every single drop of energy it can generate.
Even though energy release is constant and not stonks for void core star, it is enough to keep colapsing core star (which lost immense amount of material from ballooning phase) from yeeting. Void gives off more juice as it radiates away, until the void disappears in single massive bang.
The explosion releases energy enough to superheat weird material surrounding void yeet site, that star is temporarily stable due to expansion power of core weird material. Eventually, star radiates that heat away. Expansiobn power of core weird material ceases, which leads to slow collapse of star.
Because star is so w  i  d  e compared to mass of star, it takes so much time for collapse to actually gain noticeable speed. Attraction force struggles to act because D-radiation is dimmed and star stops gaining significantly large mass.
⌬Replicating core stars
[
]
Common replicating core star. That spherical nebula is actually a single star
These stars are not not dense, but weird material making up the star is naturally and largely transparent. How this star works is very similar to fractal core star; except that cores inside fractal keeps replicating. When certain core replicates, it also replicates every cores it contained.
Energy level of star (that goes up like mad) caused by increase of released energy from replication creates D-radiation so intense that instead of gaining more mass, weird material disintegrates into smaller particles.
Reaction is similar to photodisintegration, where insane amount of radiation from dying star (ones in our universe) disassembles atom core it strike into pure energy.
D-radiation can pass through very, very, VERY tiny particles without striking it. And that is what makes star very transparent.
Death of replicating core star is same as fractal core star: overweight of star that ultimately destroyes itself.

Closeup of energy singularity core star (no it isnt edible get that mouth off nooooo)...That planet-like sphere is a degenerate remnant of its binary star.
Finally, this is a star with at lease ordinary star shape with ordinary density. These type of stars contain energy singularity at their cores. Then what is energy singularity? it is crushed supercluster, and is like black hole in many ways except their event horizons are blue and they convert anything inside its event horizon to energy.
This kind of gargantuan "blue hole" is really blessed because it got a bunch of star's juice to mess with. Blue hole cannot convert THAT much juice into energy immediately, so it stores leftover juice at its singularity. Because there is... a little bit to much leftover juice, blue hole goes
E.
Blue hole sort of explodes away but at same time star juice

is fed into blue hole, extending its life. Blue hole and the star co-exists. Again, everlasting coexistence is of course not allowed in my cosmology >:0
With my power to alter everything I created, I limit the blue hole's lifespan... oωo
When blue hole becomes larger, it also explodes faster. If juice cannot sustain blue hole from evaporating away, star booms :D\
