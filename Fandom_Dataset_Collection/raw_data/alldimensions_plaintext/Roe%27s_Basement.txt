About
[
]
Roe's Basement
is a location controlled by
Roe
which is capable of containing an infinite amount of rooms. These rooms are inhabited by
cosmic entities
that were trapped by this place's ruler.
Structure
[
]
Roe's Basement contains ω rooms, in a 3D grid. The location itself is 4D, so that Roe can use the 4th dimension to easily access every cell. When cosmic entities are trapped, they are prevented from moving in any dimension that's beyond 3 by Roe's powers, even if their body extends into other dimensions.
Rooms
[
]
Each room is a cube with 2 meters of side length. The walls are made of a material rendered unbreakable by the laws of this space.
History

The laws of this place prevent captured entities from dying.
Roe doesn't care if you don't fit in the room, YOU'RE GOING IN. This makes it so that most big entities that are incapable of shapeshifting are very compressed within their rooms.
