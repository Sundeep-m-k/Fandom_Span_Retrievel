The S P A T I A L L O O P E R is the final object located in the
Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse
. It is the main thing that controls what the verse does. This verse is unconsiously controlled by every living being ever, including you.

Structure

]
The outside is made of iron, but it is tinted green. The sticky material of the outside has caused the iron to react and turn a green colour. The shape is an icosahedron because that's the shape it was when it was created. It isn't a trueicosahedron, because it isn't 3D, but it is the icosahedron equivalent of the dimension it is in. It hasn't changed from its shape in the span of its entire existence.
The inside is an extremely reactive hypersphere, which floats in the middle of the S P A T I A L L O O P E R. It is made of solid hydrogen, so it is very cold. This is the part that is unconsiously controlled by everyone, and the rest of the S P A T I A L L O O P E R is pulled along with it.
Purpose
[
]
The purpose of the S P A T I A L L O O P E R is to keep the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse in a good and functioning state. It is theoretically "polling" all beings, to figure out which decision would be factually correct, as it would go with the majority. Due to this, the S P A T I A L L O O P E R does a very good job at making sure the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse doesn't dysfunction.
It can move around and alter its surroundings in basically any way, but it only does the correct choices due to the "polling" aspect. It also bounces around the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse and repels away from other objects without pushing said other objects, just so it doesn't hit anything. It can bounce around the sticky material at the border of the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse.
How it works
[
]
The way it is able to be controlled by literally every living thing is due to three specific, random beings that have more of a role than other people. One of these can even actively control it, completely consiously.

Description of being
Role
Consious controller
It is simply a blob that has very high intelligence. It is this one blob in the middle of space.
It consiously controls the S P A T I A L L O O P E R and it gets the controls of every living being, one at a time, in around 1.2 seconds, every 1.2 seconds.
Signal sender
This being is just Leftunknown. He is one of the top editors on this wiki.
He unconsiously sends the signals to every living being, by simply moving in space. The quantum movements are interdimensionally connected to sending signals from the S P A T I A L L O O P E R.
Response checker
She has no personality, and no character, and she isn't very smart.
She analyzes the responses sent by every living being unconsiously and applies them to the S P A T I A L L O O P E R.
