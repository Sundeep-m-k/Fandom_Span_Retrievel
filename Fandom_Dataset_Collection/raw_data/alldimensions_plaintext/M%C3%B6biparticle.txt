Möbiparticles are small particles that construct
opaparticles
, and they are a type of particle that has an antiparticle. They are shaped like
Möbiverses
, hence their name.
Interactions between Möbiparticles
[
]
Two Möbiparticles of matter or antimatter cannot collide, and actually repel each other.
However, when two different Möbiparticles collide, they emit a force particle called a Kleinparticle, which was named because it is related to how
Kleinverses
form.

Opposite kinds of Möbiparticles can orbit each other if they are around an
apoparticle
, which forms an
opaparticle
.
