The True Omniverse
is similar to "Original
Omniverse
". Instead of containing every
Archverse
possible, it contains every object possible (with existence rank of 1).
Structure
[
]
Its structure is completely chaotic and also recursive (because it contains absolutely everything with existence rank of 1, including itself). The objects inside it are randomly scattered around The True Omniverse space. There are no forces that holding they in place, making this place highly unstable.
