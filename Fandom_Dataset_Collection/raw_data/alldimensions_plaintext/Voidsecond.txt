A
Voidsecond
is the smallest measurement of
time
possible. It is roughly equivalent to a reciprocal of
Cantor's Absolute Infinity
of a finite unit of time. This is the smallest measurement of time because of Absolute Infinity being a factor in the time here.
Its use

Excluding its uses in
this
wiki
, this unit of time is too short to be useful in practically any situation anywhere, except for very rare individual cases. Even then, based on what your definition of "smallest" and "measurement" and "possible", is, the "Voidsecond" is only one of many others similar to it.

A singular Voidsecond is how long it takes for the
Multi Omega
to double their size.
