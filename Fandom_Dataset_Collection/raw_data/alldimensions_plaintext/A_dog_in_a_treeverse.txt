The Tree
[
]
The Tree is an endlessly growing tree that starts from the core of this universe. This tree's roots come from stone, which makes the tree very strange for what it is. It is made of a unique material similar to wood, but a bit colder. The top of the tree is always very tiny, so the growth actually happens somewhere in the middle of the tree. At the top of the tree, there is a bunch of stars that the dog uses to look cooler.
