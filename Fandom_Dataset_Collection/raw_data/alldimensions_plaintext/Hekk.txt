Hekk
is a type of verse that is always smaller than the (second) smallest verse. Since explaining things logically does not always end well (see
Heck
and
Kceh
), Hekks simply defie any and all traces of logic and ends up being whatever size it needs to be the smallest verse. It is contained by
Hecc
, and travels with it when Heck warps to another verse.
Hekks sometimes contain a
Heaa
, or even multiple.
