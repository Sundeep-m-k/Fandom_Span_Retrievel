A lot of things, but to dont make like one million more articles, lets skip straight to
The Box
or
The Continuum of Nothing
Contains
Transcendentem Bubbles
Before anything, this article isnt really my idea. I just wanted to add it to AD wiki, but its a lot shorter than the OG one. Here is the OG one:
Transcendentem Continuum
The
Trascendentem Continuum
is an huge thing that holds an almost infinite amount of
Transcendentem Bubbles
. Like in the Transcendentem, this place is also very dangerous, but to be here, you need a lot more of power than in the Transcendentem.
The temperature remains unknown, but its teorized to be a bit higher than our local
Universe
.
Creator note:
I reallly dont have any ideas to continue, since the original article has too many things that could make an chaos in this wiki, being forced to do a LOOOOT of articles. But, if you can add something, please do it. It will be too helpfull to me.
