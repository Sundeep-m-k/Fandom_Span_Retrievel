The
Eelbot
(
Kef'shyf Dorbpay prow
in
The Pencil Language
), also known as the
Ealbot
(as to keep the trend of removing one letter from the start of the name), is a
Utilibot
used for fighting
.
Eelbots are mainly used
as a replacement for regular soldiers when a civilization's main army is way too small
, as Eelbots can perform
about the same or even better than a regular soldier.
Eelbots
do not have a definite shape, and can bend and deform at will
. This allows them to infiltrate enemy ships easily as they can squeeze through small spaces.
Eelbots are relatively easy to produce compared to the infamously-hard-to-produce
SLbot
.
Eelbots
can last very long and operate for 0.5
OYC
before they start to break
, and can survive over 20 hits before the Eelbot gets destroyed.
Eelbots are equipped with 2 small plasma guns, 1
Glitchonicite
gun, and 4 smaller guns. These weapons can retract anytime. Usually, the Glitchonicite gun and one plasma gun are not retracted in case if the Eelbot is ambushed.
Eelbots have at least 2 special areas where another weapon can be added.
The Eelbots are the main fighting force of an army known as
The Utilitary
.
A few
Transcendent Omni-Gods
such as
Unknown92921
have endorsed the Eelbot, as they seem to like war technology.
