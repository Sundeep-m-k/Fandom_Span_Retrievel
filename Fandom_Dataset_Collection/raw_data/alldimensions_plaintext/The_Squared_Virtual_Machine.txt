The Squared Virtual Machine
is a virtual machine which is being hosted on the
The Cubed Virtual Machine
through
The Virtual Box
software, and it is simulating
The Virtual Machine
inside it. At first the usage of multiple (in fact they are infinite) layers of virtual machines may seem pointless, but it is for security purposes to prevent viruses from spreadingâ€“the security and protection of the VMs from malicious cosmic entities is very important because if they gain access they can kill the entire
Concept eater
which is being simulated in
The Virtual Machine
.
The Squared Virtual Machine is on an even more clean installation than
The Virtual Machine
, and
The Virtual Machine
uses most of the Squared Virtual Machine's processing power because of the high system requirements of Engine Eater.
