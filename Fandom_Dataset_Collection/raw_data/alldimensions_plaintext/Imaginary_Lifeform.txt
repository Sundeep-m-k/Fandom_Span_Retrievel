Generates Vauzian energy
Imaginary Lifeforms are a being which lives within the impossible to fully grasp '
Vauzverse
', which has 3𝒊 dimensions. These beings generate TREMENDOUS power called 'Vauzian Energy'. 1 second of power generated from these odd creatures is enough to power a type 5 kardashev civilization for millennia.
These
things
are powerful enough to be considered GODS to most mortal life, and some are completely indistinguishable between the 2 phrases.
(Again, I know that the picture IS impossible.)
