System
[
]
the aleph grid system can be used to measure lengths and sizes, to use it, you can do the following:
Overlay process
[
]
overlay an infinitely large grid along a verse, the cells of the grid contain a smaller version of itself, the main cell size 1 meter.
overlay another infinitely large grid, this time the cell size equal to the previous grid’s size
rinse and repeat infinitely
(So far, you can label each grid with a number, first grid is 0, the previous grid is -1, and the next is 1, pattern extends.)
then, overlay the first hypergrid, each cell contains all of the previous grids, hypergrids can be labeled like this (H1, H2, H3…)
hypergrids are contained by another set of infinite normal grids, which are all contained by another hypergrid ((n)H(m) represents the (n)th grid from the (m)to hypergrid)
there are now an infinite amount of hypergrids, meaning hyperhypergrids, hyperhyperhypergrids, ect exist (labeled via #H#HH#HHH#…)
(you can always describe a type of grid (besides nested prefixes) that contain another type of grid)
GridType definition notation
[
]
(A):(B)
gridtype (A) contains gridtype (B)
(A)~(B)
gridtype (A) is contained by gridtype (B)
+(U)
Preset variables
+E : every gridtype.
+A : the gridtype containing the current one
-(U)
Isnt contained in preset variable +(U)
(G) =
defines a gridtype (G) in which
+(G) =
defines a variable (G) in which
,
used to state multiple things within the notation
{* = (E)}
all things that (E)
the symbols of a defines gridtype are …(GridType Symbol)#…
Measurement
[

Now that you got your grids down, you can measure, as said before.
Grid 0 has a cell size of 1 meter, each grid after is infinitely bigger than the last and each grid before is infinitely smaller than the next.
(GRID LABEL)#(NUM) : finally used to describe a length of (NUM) cells in the grid labeled (GRID LABEL)
