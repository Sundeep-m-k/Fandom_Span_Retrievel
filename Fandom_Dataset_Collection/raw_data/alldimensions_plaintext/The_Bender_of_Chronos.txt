"Lirilí Larilà, elefante nel cosmo che si transporta di qua e di là. Con i sandali e un orologio che fa tic tac, le spine del cactus mi danno un attacco de flashback. Zio Ramón arriva su un'astronave mongolfiera blu, urlando: 'Cosa ci fai qui? Hai provato paura per l'ultima volta?'. Rispondo, senza fiato: 'Sto solo cercando di capire perché un cactus con i sandali possa sfidare tutte le dimensioni a livello concettuale!'"

Uncle Ramon arrives on a blue hot air spaceship, yelling: 'What are you doing here? Have you felt fear for the very last time?' I answer, breathless: 'I'm just trying to understand why a cactus with sandals can defy all dimensions at a conceptual level!'"

About
[
]
Lirilí Larilà
, also known as
Lirili Larila
or the
Bender of Chronos
is an extremly goofy yet powerful
being
who wanders across several random
Boxes
or even larger structures.
It has gained the nickname of "Bender of Chronos" since its time warping capabilities are one of its main properties. It also represents a threat to several
Greater Triangles
due to its power level.
Abilities
[
]
Time warp
[
]
Lirilí Larilà's main ability which makes it capable of distorting time on a radius of an average-sized
Greater Triangle
, being capable of reversing time, stopping / accelerating it, etc. on that domain.
Tack manipulation
[
]
Lirilí Larilà's main tool (or weapon) is known as
Tack
, a clock-shaped magical object which is capable of enhancing its owner's control over time. It is constantly doing a tick tack sound, hence its name.
Also no, it can't be seen in the infobox. Womp womp.
Time absorption
[
]
Lirilí Larilà can even drain the time out of the affected domain and boost its own strength with it. It can only activate this ability if it has access to the Tack, though.
Reality-breaking spikes
[
]
The cactus-like spikes on Lirilí Larilà's skin can be "activated" and forced to tear through reality.
Shapeshifting
[
]
Lirilí Larilà can distort its own morphology, being able to grow extra limbs, modify the lenght of the already existant ones, develop more spikes on its skin, etc.
Some of its features are restricted, though: it always needs to have a single pair of legs, a lot of spikes and an elephant head.
Behavior
[
]
It can be classified as a chaotic neutral entity, as all it wants to do is wander around every universe it stumbles across, including the different time periods they may've had.
That makes the Bender of Chronos an extremly dangerous and erratic time bender, but not because of being pure evil but out of its curiosity to see it all.
Some of its more offensive abilities (such as the time absorption and the reality-breaking spikes) are only used when Lirilí Larilà gets agressive or feels threatened, though.
Trivia
[
]
This article obviously is a reference to the italian brainrot "Lirilí Larilà".
It also references the Wally West meme (like cmon bro, Lirilí Larilà is literally (kind of) doing his pose in the infobox's image, and there's even a reference to My Ordinary Life in the quote at the start of the article)
