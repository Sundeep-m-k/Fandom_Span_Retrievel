Multi-Universal scales:
[
]
Ackan Super-Uni Telescope: 500 billion light years, first telescope to see objects outside of this Universe, made by Retan Ackan, 2193
Jydit Hyper-Uni Telescope: 1.5 trillion light years, first telescope to see
UNI-3
(the second closest universe) and the
Calamity galaxy
, made by Alen Jydit, 2284
Bau Mega-Uni Telescope: 5 trillion light years, first telescope to discover even more universes, made by Gabriel Bau, 2463
Zios Giga-Uni Telescope: 12 trillion light years, can see UNI-8008, UNI-205 and the
Geraldson 9-21 system
. Made by Forin Zios, 2498
Para Tera-Uni Telescope: 91 trillion light years, can see the entirety of
our universe group
and parts of other universerse groups. Made by the ParaLab corporation, 2510
Para Peta-Uni Telescope: 229 trillion light years, can see half of the entire
Sene-Hiris Kilogroup
. Made by the ParaLab corporation, 2524.
Kilua Exa-Uni Telescope: 1 quadrillion light years, this telescope was revolutionary for astronomy. Can see the entire Kilua Megagroup and some other megagroups. Made by Marco Kilua, the namesake of the Kilua Megagroup in 2540.
Sene Zeta-Uni Telescope: 40 quadrillion light years, can see most of
our entire multiverse
. Made by Pedro Sene, long-time partner of Marco Kilua, 2545.
Multi-Multiversal Scale

Riyu Multi-Telescope: 282 quadrillion light years, can see outer-multiversal rogue universes. This discovery made us be able to realize some universes aren’t bound to Multiverses, and are just floating in our Kiloverse. This was made by the 7th-great grandson of Forin Zios, Kraui Riyu. It was made in 2783.
Ikan Multi-telescope: 981 quadrillion light years of sight, can see just a tiny dot of MLTI-2, the first other Multiverse discovered. As we saw this Multiverse, it was apparently a “bright blue color” which likely meant it was alive and had healthy universes inside it. We were also able to see about 4928 rogue universes. In fact, one of the rogue universes seemed to have almost a 1 trillion light year galaxy. It was made by IkanTelescopes in 2983.
