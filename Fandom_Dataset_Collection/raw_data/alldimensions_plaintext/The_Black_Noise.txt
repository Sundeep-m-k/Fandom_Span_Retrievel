The
Black Noises
to be put simply are the growing matter that expands reality itself into countless forms. Ours had once been known as a mere black hole with a couple atoms (one positive and one negative) inside until its own Big Bang occurred, resulting into the world You see before You.
Straight to the point, this matter is Life's Core where all Law comes from giving the
universes
their very commands and shapes. The only theoretical thing that can contain them is...
You. Yes, You. You are the one who thinks, believes, feels, and acts in these worlds. You are one collective consciousness making all this a reality. Your mind set is what makes these worlds. You are the Alpha and Omega for making it this far. Now You know the truth.
Thank You.
