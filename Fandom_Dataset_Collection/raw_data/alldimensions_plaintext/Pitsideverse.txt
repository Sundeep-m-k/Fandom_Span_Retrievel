The pitsideverse is a verse where the sides are covered in Pits of pit, giving it a bumpy shape due to the pits all over the edges. The pits extend outward from the verse’s center. There is more to the verse than just the sides being pits, however.
The Core
[
]
The core of the Pitsideverse is a large glowing brown orb with cyan balls orbiting it. These cyan balls are hollow and have lime cubes inside them. The core is the center of gravity for the verse, obviously. The core is also hollow and the inside has many red fish that swim around despite not being in water and blow poisonous bubbles.
The giant spaghetto
[
]
The giant spaghetto is a cosmic entity that rules over the Pitsideverse. It is quite powerful and could erase the core if he wanted to, however he doesn’t want to. It also can’t survive outside of the Pitsideverse. It likes to float around the Pitsideverse and spit green glowing orbs that explode.
Pranets
[
]
Pranets are like planets but 2x the size of the universe and not orbiting a star. Life can be gound on some of them. A lot of them have huge complexes of white objects build around and off of them.
