Glitch matter is a special type of substance mainly located in the
Glitchyverse
. It has the ability to control matter and the way it behaves.
Due to this property, the Glitchyverse is an unstable, chaotic reality where only
Chaos Entities
can survive properly.
It is made of a mix of Isychros matter and
Primordium Delta
.
Glitchonicite
could've possibly originated from the first Glitch Matter.
