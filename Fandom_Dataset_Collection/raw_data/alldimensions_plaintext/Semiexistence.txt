Semiexistence
is a FES rank between
nonexistence
and
existence
, which is the strongest one in our
Cetaverse
. It is the only FES rank that can't be found in verses beyond
Omniverses
.

Property
[
]
Most interactions with
existence
also work properly for semiexistence, but however, couldn't interact
hyperatoms
beyond
biradioactivity
. Finding differences between existence and semiexistence is 99.99% impossible, except for
biradioactivity
hyperatoms, which only 50% of elements can interact semiexistence.
The 50% Semiexistential Law
[
]
The 50% Semiexistential Law says that for all forces in a
Cetaverse
, 50% of them can't properly interact semiexistent objects. For example, a
Multiverse
should have equal amount of forces that can interact it, and forces that can't interact it.
Studies currently show that there is a 99% chance that the law is correctly interpreted for scales between
Universes
and
Cetaverses
. Therefore, there is a noticeable problem on universal-scale, and should be researched further for resolving it.
Describability
[
]
Like existence, semiexistence is limited to non-abstract objects. Therefore, it can be easily described by us.
Amount
[
]
In
our Barrelplex
, the amount of semiexistent objects is at least
ω
∗
10
↑
↑
100
{\displaystyle \omega *10\uparrow \uparrow 100}
, due to being isolated in
Omniverses
, and also
Barrels
. However, it is really hard to determine the estimated amount for
our Cetaverse
, because all Barrels are inequally separated over 2 Cetaverses.
Synthesis
[
]
Due to being a FES rank, a
Protospatial particle
for this rank is absolutely impossible. However, it could be synthesized by equal amounts of
Protoverses
and
Nullirotos
.
Trying to synthesize with unequal amounts would result in chaotic situations, even destroying
Boxes
. Fortunately, Semiexistence is a really common one compared to other FES ranks.
Interactions
[
]
Nonexistence (Existence-0)
[
]
Semiexistence would be entirely
nonexistent
, if trying to interact with it. Unfortunately, all semiexistent objects are only located in normal
Omniverses
(mostly existent), and isolated in all
Barrels
, due to a really high presence of nonexistence in
the Outside
.
Negaexistence (Existence-(-1))
[
]
Negahiggs can barely interact semiexistence to make more
negaexistent
objects, but semiexistent entities couldn't spawn negaexistent objects by imagining, which causes a problem why Negahiggs is significantly more powerful than imaginations.
The 50% Semiexistential Law is correctly interpreted for all existence-(-0.5) objects (semi-negaexistence). But existence-(-1.5) really doesn't exist, because a existence rank between existence-(-2) and negaexistence always turns into one of those both ends, due to
Acic Fields
. This anomaly is called
Acic Law
.
Superexistence (Existence-2)
[
]
Semiexistence can properly interact
superexistence
, without a single anomaly.
There is also a FES rank called semi-superexistence, in which it goes between existence and superexistence, making it existence-1.5. The 50% Semiexistential Law is correctly interpreted for all interactions with semi-superexistence.
Metaboxial structures
[
]
We don't know that
megaboxial
hyperatoms could interact semiexistence, and by the study from most researches, there shouldn't be.
