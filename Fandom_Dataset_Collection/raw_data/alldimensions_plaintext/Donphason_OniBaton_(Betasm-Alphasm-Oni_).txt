Donphason OniBaton was a major politician and want to be minor cosmic deity on
Betasm-Alphasm-Oni Megacity-Planet
, this guy has made influence on the
Betasm-Oni-Jartos District (B-A-O-MCPV) ï¿¼
area of his planet. This guy is currently arrested by local authorities, though attempts to resist arrest and imprisonment was due to the
BAOBG Company
who had endorsed his campaign and promised him other kinds of powers. He ran on a very successful platform on reforming his district to reduce corruption and making the area safer and more respected across the planet. He was regarded as beloved by many, except for recently when his criminal and corrupt nature has been revealed to the publicly after being arrested and going on trial. He also developed a cult like following of people obsessed with him, worshipping him like a god or very minor cosmic entity. His cult like following caused interest of beings like
Batros
, and
The Bat-GOD
in case they actually succeeded in giving him more power than he ever needs or deserves. However, they have come close into making him a cosmic entity of his own. He is going to be moved to
Prison 0101 of the Bat-GOD
, secretly because the Bat-GOD does not want to see such a person locked up in a "mortal prison", even though he is very much human.
