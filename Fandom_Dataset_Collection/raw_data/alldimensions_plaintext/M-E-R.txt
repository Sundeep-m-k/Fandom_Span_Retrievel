The M-E-R is formed when
M-E-Os
group up. M-E-R is peacefull and wont kill or eat, its likely because it knows killing is bad from the grown brain it has gotten.
The M-E-R has 4 fins, 4 small blue eyes, an anteater looking mouth, (without the fur and ears) and some armor. The M-E-R is a true neutral, meaning it will attack you if you attack it.
M-E-Rs will hide in the shell and turn its shell color black to hibernate. Its unknown why it does that, maybe its to protect the civilisation inside of them. They have been seen to destroy the evil, which is good!
