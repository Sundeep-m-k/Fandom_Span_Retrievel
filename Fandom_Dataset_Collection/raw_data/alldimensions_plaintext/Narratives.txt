Narrative
- the level of existence in which certain
verses
are located.  The difference between narratives is the same as between
reality
and
fiction
. That is, for the second narrative, the first narrative is a fiction, imagination or simulation. None of the
creatures
can travel beyond their narrative, unless they have learned pataphysics or higher beings have made them real. For the narrative below, the narrative above is beyond the
concept
of size.
Interpretations
[
]
Low interpretation, as in imagination, fiction, games.
High interpretation, as in the whole Internet, which can also be considered part of the narrative, since this is information, but it is controversial, so I divided it into sub-interpretations:
