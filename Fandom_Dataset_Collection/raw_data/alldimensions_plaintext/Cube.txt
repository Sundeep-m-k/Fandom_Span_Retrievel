A
cube
is the
3-dimensional
hypercube
. It is also the only platonic solid that can perfectly tessellate
space
by itself in a honeycomb.
It has the
Schläfli symbol
, meaning that it is made of
squares
, three of which meet at each
vertex
. It can also be represented by the
Schläfli symbols
{
}
3
{\displaystyle { \{ \}  }^{ 3 }}
as it is the product of three
line segments
,
{
4
}
×
{
}
{\displaystyle \{ 4\} \times \{ \} }
as it is the product of a
square
and a
line segment
(in other words, a
square
-based
prism
) and
t
{
2
,
4
}
{\displaystyle t\{ 2,4\}}
as it is a truncated Square Hosohedron.

The cube is composed of many squares stack on each other. It is composed of two parallel squares linked by a ring of four squares. Three
squares
join at each corner.
When viewed from a square face, it appears as a constant sized square. When viewed from an edge, it looks like a line expanding to a
rectangle
and back. Finally, when viewed from a corner, it is a point that expands into an equilateral
triangle
, then truncates to various
hexagons
, then goes back to a triangle (oriented the other way) which then shrinks.
