The Timeline
is one of all possibility timelines in
Eternity
. Single timeline contains fluent events going back and forth by time. Timelines are in everywhere with timeflow, and everything produces timeline. For example, timeline of one electron appears once, and continues empty for eternity. Same with universe, timeline appears active for once (finite or infinite or beyond time) until universe ceases to exist and timeline continues inactive for eternity.
