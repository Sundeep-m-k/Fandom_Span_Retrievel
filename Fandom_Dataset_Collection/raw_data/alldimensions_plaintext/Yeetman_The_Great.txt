Yeetman The Great
is a decently powerful cosmic entity that rules a random
Atom
. He is an expert capitalist and owns several companies across the
Bhatsuperverse
we live in, his corprate empire is larger that his national one, and he's rich. Also can erase a few Atoms in an instant, but would rather do some stonks. His power is about 1/5^18 that of HE, and Yeetman is very kind with his powers, usually using them to help advertise.
Company History
[
]
Due to Yeetman coming from an incredibly smart species, he was able to inherit his father's companies at the age of 17. Yeetman then continued to slowly merge all of the sub-brands and small puppet companies into a single, large entity known as YeetCO, which had two branches, YeetFood and YeetMisc. YeetFood had been the dominant company, making most of the profit with adjustable muffins, FlavorAll cake, and other foods such as Chimera Foods. However, these would soon be bought by Oflici Cereals, a dominant food company and the one Yeetman had worried about the longest. Due to beurocracy n stuff though, Yeetman took control of Oflici and re-instated YeetFood and YeetMisc. oflici's dominance basically meant he tripled his company's size.
His Species & His People
[
]
Yeetman is a Dewdite, a race of blue-skinned humanoids which are 9ft/3m on average. They have four arms, two legs, and ten total limbs. They have small utility tentacle-like structures on their legs, banned in sports which Dewdites love. They also have a small, tail-like appendage in the same location as a monkey's tail that acts as a backup head with eyes, a mouth, and a small brain connected to the main one.
Yeetman is one of the only Dewdites with glasses.
His Nation
[
]
Nothing special, however, he is a god-emperor where he resides and is able to buy entire governmental control over nations due to his monetary value. His nation has access to some of the most advanced ships in their local
Knathsuperverse
, and these vessels are used to keep their trade going. Due to his many puppet states, he has good relations all around, either due to puppeting or fear of the empire. They can also use technology that changes one's species as long as the patient is sentient. This has been done before, though.
