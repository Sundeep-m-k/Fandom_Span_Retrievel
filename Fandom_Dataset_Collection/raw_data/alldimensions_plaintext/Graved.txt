Graved is a place outside of space and time where things go to die. On the outside it looks like a regular graveyard but its something MUCH DEEPER. When something dies it will end up here there's nothing to do and its pitch black. After 10 minutes of darkness something will happen depending on some things. If the object that dies is not living like a universe or a moon it will be revived in a ghost like state. If the object that dies is living then it will depend on the amount of sins Its committed if it goes up or down if you know what I mean. If the object has committed at least 20 sins or has a big sin like murder then it goes down if not it goes up. Now for the stats.
That is all for now
