Streets
are endlessly winding paths which contain
Hwagoanoids
walking on them. They're looped, and constantly change in an organic way. Sometimes there form forks and convergences in the Streets, which makes them big interconnected messes. They contain

Structure
[
]
The Streets are mainly composed of sections which are as wide as 10 Hwagoanoids. On the top side, where the Hwagoanoids walk, there are yellow lines much like streets in real life. On the bottom side, there are growing crystals of Hwagonite, which is the material that the Streets are made of.
Formation
[
]
It is thought that our Street was created by an ancient race of Hwagoanoids as part of their infrastructure in¬†!Ã∂
0.6
BOYC. œâ years later, a runaway Hwagification reaction caused our Street to start multiplying through our
Kalanomnihedron
and throuought some others.
Hwagonite
[
]
Hwagonite
(chemical symbol:
Hwg
)
is the material that the Streets are made out of. It is very resilitant but also very malleable, which is what allows the Streets to be constantly bending and changing. Hwagonite also has the distinct ability of having an astronomically strong gravity toward the top face, which makes gravity in a Street similar to that of
Earth
's. Hwagonite has a distinct "top face" and "bottom face" which define and limit lots of its properties.
It actually slowly grows through a process known as Hwagification which creates square-shaped crystals on the bottom face of it, and are the origin of the crystals in the bottom of the Streets.
Megastreets
[
]
Megastreets are rare streets that have a diameter of at least
!Ã∂
1,000,000
ly. While this is still nothing compared to the size of an average
Kalanomnihedron
, they have a zone of influence that is large enough to be seen from outside of their Kalanomnihedron.
