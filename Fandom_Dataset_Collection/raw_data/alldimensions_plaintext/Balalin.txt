Balalins hidden form when people meet him, so the people don't die out of shock
[
]
Balalin is a god like no other (as he can somehow even beat
The lord of lords
which is ONLY true by pure luck, if he uses 100% of his power with his older brother, they have about 1 in a googleplexian chance of winning) and is the little brother of
THE TRUE CREATOR
, but hes a peaceful god, he just created the true real reality after a long time of learning how to create matter (basically a barrier from the void) for more company, he also created the lord of lords because he was bored and made him a bit too OP and now it can beat itself
The reason why the true real reality is a type of barrier is because if there wasn't a barrier, everything would spread out and eventually mix together into some mess so unpredictable it would be out of his control, and he doesn't want that, he just wants more company other than THE TRUE CREATOR, his older brother
Balalin before he created the real reality, alone with his older brother (off-screen) in the void
Balalin after he made his
real reality
, just happy that hes gonna have some more company sooner or later
(i know this is unrelated, but technically
The infinite void
outside the true real reality "contains" it, but im not too sure)
