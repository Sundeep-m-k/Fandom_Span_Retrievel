Oddly, the technology required to escape this verse is an alternate version of already existent tech. By creating a
Berryverse
, which contains itself a finite amount of times, and going to the outside of it, it breaks logic, allowing you to escape this verse. Anything containing this verse doesn't actually contain this verse, it is just on a higher level of a sort of "meta-containment".
The dimensionality mentions the use of the
O
n
{\displaystyle \mathcal{O}_n}
function and
Y
{\displaystyle \mathfrak{Y}}
.
O
n
{\displaystyle \mathcal{O}_n}
is the
order function
, which is used in combination with other functions to produce the so called
"order" of a thing
.
Y
{\displaystyle \mathfrak{Y}}
is an
incredibely
complex constant
. It is the constant of size.
Just like Euler's constant (
e
{\displaystyle e}
) is the constant of growth.
The
Thubbunurrhypil

Thubbunurrhypil
,
Quarterthubbunurrhypil
, turning black instead of white.
Studying the Supremum of Limits is practically impossible and useless. Nothing can be obtained from it. When it comes to hand outs of knowledge, this supremum gives empty hands.
To give a biref and foolishly insignificant example of the
sheer difficulty of finding anything on this being / object
, when scientists were calculating the approximate position of the Supremum of Limits with respect to any object from the first
Realm
, the value
diverges into random gibberish infinities and randoms
. However, when scientists calculate the position of it with respect to
2nd Realmly objects
, like the
Yetmmud
, the values converges,
but it is unknown as to what it converges to
.
