Introduction
[
]
The
All-Verse
is a humongous structure that is
!Ã∂
light years big. They're almost impossible to destroy, even with the strongest machines the 2 civilizations that have traversed our All-Verse have.
Going out of these structures is almost impossible, as the temperature once you escape through the north side is¬†!Ã∂ X-Kelvins(1 X-Kelvins is equal to¬†!Ã∂ Kelvins). This is extremely hot, but on the other side, the south side, it is negative -¬†!Ã∂ X-Kelvins. You have to go directly east or west because if you are even a quectometer off, it is¬†!Ã∂ negative or positive X-Kelvins. The most a suit can be made to withstand is A Googolplexianth X-Kelvins(positive or negative).
The All-Web
[
]
The All-Web is a structure consisting of Quectillions of All-Voids. These structures make up the All-Verses, and if you were to see one, they are so bright they can literally burn your eyes of if you look at them without eye covering for .00(ƒ¶ number of 0‚Äôs)0001 seconds.
