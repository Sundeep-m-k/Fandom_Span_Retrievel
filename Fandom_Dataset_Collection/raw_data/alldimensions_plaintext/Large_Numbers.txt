What are large numbers? They help us understand the
Universe
. We can use these numbers in our everyday life. What is 1,000,000,000? If you want to learn more about them, this is for you.
What is a large number?
[
]
A
large number
is a number that is greater than 100. Try and count to 100, yes it only takes about a minute and 40 seconds if you count slow. So we can say that as you count slower, the longer it takes to count.
Large number list
[

Million (=
10
6
{\displaystyle {10}^{6}}
)
This number is so tiny that it's familiar in our world.
In 2007, Jeremy Harper finished counting aloud to a million, and earned his place in the Guiness World Records.
A megasecond (1 million seconds) is 11.5 days.
A tower of a million people would stretch 1700 km high, 4 times higher than ISS.
Billion (=
10
9
{\displaystyle {10}^{9}}
)
The world population is 8 billion.
Counting to a billion is only allowed for immortals, because it takes 125 years.
A gigasecond (billion seconds) is 31.7 years, which most people probably want to celebrate.
Trillion (=
10
12
{\displaystyle {10}^{12}}
)
Our planet has ~3.5 trillion fish.
Human body contains ~50 trillion cells.
A terasecond (trillion seconds) is 31,688 years, so a terasecond ago was the time of the last neanderthals.
Quadrillion (=
10
15
{\displaystyle {10}^{15}}
)
Our planet has ~1 quadrillion ants.
In ~200 quadrillion seconds from now, the Sun will be a red giant.
Quintillion (=
10
18
{\displaystyle {10}^{18}}
)
The diameter of the Milky Way Galaxy is ~1 quintillion kilometers.
World Ocean contains 326 quintillion gallons of water.
3x3x3 Rubik's cube has ~43 quintillion combinations.
Septillion (=
10
24
{\displaystyle {10}^{24}}
)
Decillion (=
10
33
{\displaystyle {10}^{33}}
)
Googol (=
10
100
{\displaystyle {10}^{100}}
)
NOT to be confused with Google!! Google is actually a misspelling.
The googol was coined in 1920 by Milton Sirotta, 9 year old nephew of Edward Kasner. 20 years later, the latter published the book
Mathematics and the Imagination
.
It is also the namesake of Google (reason is to describe the size of the internet).
It is larger than the atoms in the universe (
10
80
{\displaystyle {10}^{80}}
), but still smaller than the atoms in a
multiverse
.
The time it takes for the supermassive black hole with 20 trillion solar masses is ~1 googol years.
Only immortals are allowed to imagine the size of a googol.
Centillion (=
10
303
{\displaystyle {10}^{303}}
)
Millillion (=
10
3003
{\displaystyle {10}^{3003}}
)
Micrillion (=
10
3
,
000
,
003
{\displaystyle {10}^{3,000,003}}
)
Googolplex (=
10
10
100
{\displaystyle {10}^{{10}^{100}}}
)
Also proposed by Milton Sirotta in 1938, and suggested it should be 1 followed by writing zeroes before getting tired. Edward Kasner, not satisfied by this vague definition, refined it to its current quantity.
There is a book series called
Googolplex Written Out
, by Wolfgang Nitscher, with
10
94
{\displaystyle {10}^{94}}
volumes.
Googolduplex (=

Googoltriplex (=

{\displaystyle {10}^{{10}^{{10}^{{10}^{100}}}}}
)
Googolquadriplex (=

{\displaystyle {10}^{{10}^{{10}^{{10}^{{10}^{100}}}}}}
)
Super K (=10↑↑↑↑3)
Graham's Number (=
G
(
64
)
{\displaystyle G(64)}
)
This number is UNIMAGINABLY larger than a googolplex.
TREE(3) (=???)
We can use these numbers to figure out the
Universe
. Creators will often use these numbers if they are talking about the vast
Universe
. The largest non-salad number was discovered by
Emlightened
and is
the Sasquatch
. However, there are also some transfinite numbers:
Aleph-null (=
N
0
{\displaystyle N0}
)
Omega (=
w
{\displaystyle w}
)
The study of discovering large numbers is called
googology
, and you may learn more about it
