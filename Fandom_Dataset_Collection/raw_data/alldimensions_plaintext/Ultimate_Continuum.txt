The
Ultimate Continuum
is a verse that contains the
Ternary Omniuses
and is contained by the
Name Not Founds
, and it's the last in this set of sequence; Binary, Ternary, Quaternary, etc. This continuum is the absolute last sequence.

Size Explained
[
]
The Ultimate Continuum is so big, that even an infinity omnius would pale in comparison to the size of this """"verse""". It represents everything that the most powerful Omni gods can even start to comprehend. And this is the first verse (all verses bigger than this also apply to what's about to be said) that all Omni Gods can't destroy. I'll list some milestones of this "verse".
Sequence 3
[
]
Now, I'm not going to try and describe the sets of sequence 3 and beyond, as they are too complicated to describe. This is put here as it is the first one that cannot be described by any entity.
Sequence 5
[
]
Sequence 5 is the limit of the
Hyper Void Lord
and is the biggest possible set of nothingness ever. It's so massive that even
Gerald
has a hard time explaining it to mortal minds.
Sequence 8
[
]
Sequence 8 is the limit of really any god's destructive power. All entities on
The Official Cosmic Entity Hierarchy
stronger than an
Omegahuman
can survive here.
Sequence 1,382
[
]
Sequence 1,382 is where the glitches start happening. At the beginning of this layer, they're stable, but very slowly, they start turning unstable. In fact, at the limit of sequence 1382, it's so glitchy that it already surpasses the
Paradoxical Infinity
in glitchiness.
Sequence 1,383
[
]
Sequence 1,383 is where sequences start getting so unstable that they produce copies of themselves (faster and faster as the sequences go higher). And since copies of sequences are IN the sequence, sequences at this level or above are constantly doubling faster and faster as the sequences get bigger.
Sequence 1,387
[
]
Sequence 1,387 is the point where sequences are doubling at the maximum possible speed; 100 times per
Voidsecond
.
Sequence Infinity
[
]
Sequence infinity of the hierarchy is the point where all cardinal numbers have been surpassed in the sequence, and also has a strange barrier that prevents
The Multi-Omega
from growing to this sequence's size.
