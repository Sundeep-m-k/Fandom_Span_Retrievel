The Inaccessibleverse
The
Distant Reality
is a reality too far away to travel to. Even
omni-gods
as strong as
The Primordial
and
THE CREATOR
have not gone this far. That means that The Distant Reality is very unknown and obscure.
There are many creatures that exist within this reality, most are beyond our comprehension and act very much like
2nd Realm
creatures such as a
Yetmmud
. Also, no laws of physics inside
The Inaccessibleverse
and below exist here.
All the fundamental laws of spacetime and the 4 forces do not apply here. The Distant Reality has been mostly explored by the creatures living inside of it. Some parts of The Distant Reality are completely messed up, and other parts don't even seem to exist. This makes traveling inside this verse quite hard.
