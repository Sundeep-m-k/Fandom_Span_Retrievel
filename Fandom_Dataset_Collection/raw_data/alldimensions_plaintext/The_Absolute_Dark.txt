The Absolute Dark
is a verse that contains most of the light from
the Absolute Light
, making it dark in comparison.
The Absolute Dark is also a barrier that contains the Absolute Light, and although it contains The Absolute Light, The Absolute Light is not actually a part of it.
In large-scale structures, The Absolute Dark is commonly found in large voids that it can fit in, although this is so common that we cannot list them all in the Contained by section of the infobox. The only other place where The Absolute Dark is found in is
the Absolute Balance
.
Opaqueness

As previously mentioned, The Absolute Dark is a barrier that contains The Absolute Light and most of the light from it, but how much exactly? The Absolute Dark only allows for some ultraviolet light and under to surpass it, and even then only extremely small portions of that escape to the outside. This makes The Absolute Dark glow a faint white.
