Calamity Galaxy is an interuniversal galaxy that is located in the
Local Universe Group
. It is the closest object to
Our Universe
, with only 960 billion light-years of distance. It is triple the size of the Milky Way, and is remarkably unstable.
Structure
[
]
The Calamity Galaxy is a spiral galaxy with 6-8 arms, being 3 kly thick and 255 kly large. It has a supermassive black hole binary system in its center, with the black holes being called Calamitus A and B.
Origins
[
]
The direction the galaxy is going to and its short distance from our universe suggests it was ejected from it in a catastrophic event. Because of this, the galaxy is very unstable, and it is estimated that it will only live for a few more billion years.
Civilisations
[
]
This galaxy's instability does not prevent it from having life. Here are some civilizations which originated from it:
Pesoros (Kardashev scale 3.8)
They have a suprisingly good relation with Humanity, evolved from calamitian insects

Picos (Kardashev scale 2.9)
Picomachines that led their parent species (the

) to extinction and took its place.
