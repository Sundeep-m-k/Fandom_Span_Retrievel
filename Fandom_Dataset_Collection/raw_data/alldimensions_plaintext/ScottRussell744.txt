About
[
]
Scott
, also known as
ScottRussell744
(full name) and known as "the First Speedster." ScottRussell744 is an unfathomably powerful and fast
entity
with enough strength and speed to threaten the entirety of
fiction
.
This is because of his overpowered meme status, which ends up granting him
Memetic
levels of power and justifying his godlike status on battles.
Lore
[
]
ScottRussell744 used to be a normal but lonely being, until a mysterious object struck near his hometown called
Robloxia.
Curious, Scott went to investigate what the noise was. Once he arrived at the crash site, the object was pulsing with a mysterious yellowish energy. Scott walked up to the object and touched it out of pure curiosity. When he touched the object, though, an unbelievable amount of energy and power surged through the object and went through to Scott, giving him an insane amount of power and energy. This gives Scott the courage to train himself, all by himself in fact.
ScottRussell744 thus trained himself in several martial arts, like Muay Thai, Karate, Boxing, Kickboxing, Jujitsu, Brazilian Jujitsu and Krav Maga. Scott train his body nonstop for hours on end and pushed himself to limit every training session he did. Thus making him a master martial artist in a few years.
Also, ScottRussell744 made the Speed Force, a cosmic force based on movement and velocity. The same force that gave the speedsters their powers.
