HVC Xenoverse
or just
XV
is the name used in the
Hypervector-based Cosmology
(HVC) to differenciate from the common usage of "Xenoverse" in other hypercosmological hierarchies (altough "Xenoverse" is the most used concept for it in this cosmology), and it refers to the sum of all
Universes
that are from the same
HVC Ultraverse
of the transmitter or observer, but not from their
HVC Hyperverse
. This type of
Verse
is not strictly a hypercosmological object, due to its relative condition to the transmitter or observer, so it's more of a a mathematical construct working as a communicative tool to locally differenciate between types of universes. The mentioned sum is formed by all universes that have some laws of physics and/or initial conditions that differ from what is possible under all possible laws of physics and/or initial conditions from the point of view of the transmitter.
In HVC, the counterpart of the Xverse is the
Endoverse
, and these two together form the
HVC Ultraverse
.
Hypergeometry of the Xverse
[
]
The comparison between the behavior of
quantum hyperspaces
and currently accepted conclusions on
hypermechanics
reveal an absolute equivalence of values and potential crash rates between processed imaginary worlds within possible hyperspaces (by force-filtering space dimensions in dynamic world generation & processing) and theoretical calculations on impossible hyperspaces with the same hyperobjects. That's why there's an overall agreement on the idea that all verses that are not physically possible within any laws of physics and/or have theoretically impossible initial conditions are actually the same thing as all verses that don't have space dimensions. This is why the Xverse is also defined by the absence of spatial propierties within its
hyperobjects
, so the universes that emerge from
hyperposition
only have a time dimension and zero space dimensions.
It's considered indemonstrable if it's possible for a world within the Xverse to have multiple time dimensions, but it's not currently possible to execute worlds with these properties, since the branching of hyperspaces is actually defined by the autopoiesis process of the time dimension of dynamic worlds. It's also apparently impossible for the Xverse to contain static worlds.
