Binary Omnius
The
Ternary Omnius
is a verse that is EXTREMELY big and it's size is basically impossible to comprehend unless done by an all-comprehending entity such as
Gerald
. If it's not in the
Binary Omnius
, it's either here or beyond here.
Don't think it's around the size of the
Ultimate Continuum
, that's just an infinite set of infinite sets of infinite sets of … infinite sets of infinite sets of Ternary Omnii with an infinite amount of the containments and that is just a portion of it, it's still contained by a bigger set that's infinitely long and it's an infinite loop of those. It's basically just Infinity^^^2 times the size of TO.
It’s the 2nd in Omnius chain.
