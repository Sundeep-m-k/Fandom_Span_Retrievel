The
Barrelverse
contains all the barrels in
The Box
.
The collection is in a white realm of space. All of the barrels are colorless and the image to the right in the infobox simply shows a false-color rendition for simplicity sake.
The barrels are the largest of their kind and you absolutely don't need any larger ones.
