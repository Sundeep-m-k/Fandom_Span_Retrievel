The
Metaverse
is the 3rd verse in the main hierarchy. It contains many
Multiverses
and can have many appearances. The one shown on the right is only included due to it being visually pleasing, but those kinds of Metaverses are also popular.
A Metaverse may sometimes have anomalous distinct Multiverses which have very different laws then the rest of the bunch. If any civilizations are present in such a Multiverse, they will find it difficult to make contact with other neighbouring civilizations, as their differences would be jarring and sometimes too difficult to resolve.
Metaverses are located inside of
Xenoverses
, and they formed from the walls / barriers of their Xenoverse. Through natural occurences, a Xenoverse's surface may bend upon itself, creating loops which pass through themselves and eventually, after becoming too large, break appart and form Metaverses. The resulting Metaverse will be perfectly spherical and the Xenoverse will almost instantaneously return to its normal shape.
An outlying property of Metaverses is their ability to transfer matter information/laws/forces between
Multiverses
, and each other.  A consequence of this property causes non-archverse verses in the "mainland" of Metaverses to frequently exhibit instability. This means that Metaverses often generate tons of virtual or nonexistent objects, such as
Virtual Omniverses
and
Imaginary Dodecahedra
. Due to the properties of Metaverses mentioned earlier, Metaverses are essential to the
Omniverse
. As Multiverses have similar
Universes
, Metaverses have Multiverses with similiar enough sets of laws, due to their properties. The variance in sets of laws is perscribed onto a Multiverse upon its formation, similar to
universe formations
, and they're often similar and can even show signs of law-mixing.
Also, the Metaverse contains the Ordinal Universe, which is full of ordinals (in every Multiverse, There is a exact copy, just smaller)
Metaverse Formation
[
]
Described within the
Multiverse
article
As a Proto-Xenoverse transitions into a Xenoverse, the near instantaneous transition snaps off all folds, alongside with the crossings that converge the geometry of the shape of each fold onto them, like singularities. The folds aren't stable under this configuration, so they collapse from their uneven, assymetrical shapes, into perfect spheres. After this, the crossings are captured.
