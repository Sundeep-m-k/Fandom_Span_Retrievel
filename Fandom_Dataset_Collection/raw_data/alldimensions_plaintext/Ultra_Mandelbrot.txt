About
[
]
This is the
Ultra Mandelbrot
. It is a high-class entity but it cant be interacted with because it doesn't even live in existence, instead it ives in
the zoom
. It also has an omega form that can happen at random and its very rare to see when in this form it gets bigger and can move faster (not moving)
History
[
]
This beast was formed from the Mandelbrot zoom and started out as a little Mandelbrot a size of 1 billion light years long. It feeds on nothing it stands still and doesn't move it gains size from being still and not moving if it moves once it could die instantly it slowly is pushed around and gains size. It grew to 9 septillion light years long by eating another Mandelbrot. Later in would gain a blueish haze around it by eating more matter and more material while getting larger and larger in the process this was when it was 4 million years old at this point its larger then its kind (the normal size is 2 thousand feet) and this Mandelbrot has 15 forms through out its life and there are some images of its forms (wip).
Forms (WIP)

The 1st form Ultra Mandelbrot before it became what it is now.
This image taken from a person called bob. This is the only image of his 2nd form.
This is its 3rd form surrounded by matter.
This form of the ultra was when he was in his 4th form as you can see he has been surrounded by more matter.
this omega form can happen at random when this happens it is bigger and stronger.
These images are a compilation of all of his forms so enjoy them all there are at least 10 documented forms of him.
