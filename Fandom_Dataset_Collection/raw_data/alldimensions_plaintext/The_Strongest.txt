The
Strongest
(not really honestly)
is a "being?" Or thing that rules over the
Eternal World
. He has absolutely no beginning at all and is even before that meaning, if you were to meet "him" in person or something, you couldn't even see the face or really most of the body because it's covered by wings.
The image of him shown in the infobox isnt even accurate, he has WAY MORE WINGS however the artistic representation wanted there to make his appearance easier to understand for the reader, visual viewer, author, etc.
He has no real name, however "TRUE UNDEFINED" "33404"(means error) "NaN%" ALEPH NULL and NaN seems to fit him the most due to certain traits.
The reason why NaN is called the strongest is because
he has never lost once
, though who were his opponents anyways? There was that one
dreamers
army when he was doing a massive siege agaisnt random
Aboves
for no reason, and thats pretty much his only relevant match.
He doesnt erase his opponents, but instead he annihilates them, absolute OBLITERATION, it doesn't matter If your oc is infinite and has no concept of death, dying, or non-existence and is beyond life and boundlessness
and that they can destroy all the multiverses, omniverses, superverses, etc.
, they WILL get annihilated regardless and ALEPH NULL DOES NOT EVEN NEED TO THINK TO DO SO.
