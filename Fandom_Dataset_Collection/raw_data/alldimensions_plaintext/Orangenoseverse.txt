1st section
[
]
The first section is full of sharp rocks, as well as a bit of diamond.
It is where the tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt entity had some ham there, but other than that, this is not special.
2nd section
[
]
The second section is not special either. It is simply a transition to the third section.
3rd section
[
]
This section takes up the majority of the verse, and it is where pretty much all of the verse's good properties lie.
4th section
[
]
It is a void of nothingness.
5th section
[
]
This section contains cheeseburgers, and that is the only defining feature.
6th section
[
]
The last section is the solid crust. It is simply made out of foam.
