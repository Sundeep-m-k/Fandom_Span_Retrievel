Verse lag
[
]
Verse lag is when a verse starts lagging like in a video game. Not deadly, but severe lag is a sign of a verse crash. If you experience this, call verse glitch control please!
verse crash
[
]
Verse crashes are one of the most dangerous types of verse glitches. They are when, suddenly, all
uqraek fibers
in the verse switch places with each other, causing a devastating effect. 4 minutes later, the verse starts to slow down. 1 hour after that, the verse will completely stop for 2 minutes, and then the verse suddenly explodes! If you leave the verse while it’s crashing, it won’t explode, but all life in it will die.
verse softlock
[
]
A verse softlock is when a verse suddenly starts to go back in time 1 hour (everything back in time, like memory, locations, death, etc.) and that hour will play out exactly the same way as before, including it restarting after the hour finishes again. There are several ways to stop this, but the easiest one is for somebody to leave and re-enter the verse, and the verse will mysteriously go back to normal.
verse hardlock
[
]
A verse hardlock is very similar to a verse softlock, but rarer. It seems to have a 1/6 chance to replace a verse softlock. In these ones, the time loop happens every second. Also, leaving and re-entering the verse doesn’t stop it. Instead, you need special equipment from the outside the handle it.
verse fatal error
[
]
The verse just turns blue, then into a red ring, then explodes. That’s it. It’s gone. It can’t be stopped because the moment it turns blue, the verse is gone, all people and objects in it are gone, it’s just irreversible. Even if you go back in time, that verse will still be gone. If you go back while it’s blue or a red ring, it’ll still be a blue or a red ring. Any pre-alphasm god, even one on the level of chunky cheese, will die if they are inside when it happens. RIP
