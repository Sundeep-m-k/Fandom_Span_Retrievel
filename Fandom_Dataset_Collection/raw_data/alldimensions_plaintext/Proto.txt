Proto
is a transfinitely small omnipotent entity that lives in a
Protoverse
. If a Protoverse was 1 meter big, the Proto in it would be ∆ê meters, being WAAAAAY smaller.
A Planck time to a Proto is basically the same as a second to a human. This makes Protos go at an astronomically fast pace, while it looks like they go at human-like speed to the Protos themselves.
Actions
[
]
A Proto does a few things. The stuff are listed below.
Every 80 Planck times, Proto will teleport to a random verse and then protect it from being corrupted, and uncorrupt it if its already corrupted, and then teleport back to its Protoverse.
If an entity mass corrupts verses, Proto will destroy the entity and revert its corruptive actions, and protect the verses involved.
Protos will gather up to fight teams of corruptive entities quicker, as a Proto can only kill 1 entity every 10 Planck times.
