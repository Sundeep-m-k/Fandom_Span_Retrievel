The
V früit
is a tangled mess of
M-E-RS
. Since they group up, they sometimes clip inside eachother and merge into a universe. The shape they prefer is a
hexagon, cube, circle, and a long string. V früit is so massive that all the liquids and solids would sink in. But not the gases nor plasma. Since only the liquids and solids are in the middle, The gravity in the middle is so much, that the middle turns into a
Quark star
.
V früits are known to have hypernovas every second, its because in these universes, nothing can turn into a black hole, makeing the matter ricochede and relase a huge amount of energy. Thus causeing the hypernovas.
V früit is just like a human brain, exept a grahams number times smarter. The V früits sometimes live in resource rich places, and ask some fun facts, and they also have to give matter because if they dont. Then they dont get the prize. If they ever try to attack V früit, V früit will just eat them. So be friendly to V früit.
