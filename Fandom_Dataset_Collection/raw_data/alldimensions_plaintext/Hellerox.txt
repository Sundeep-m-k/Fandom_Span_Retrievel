The
Hellerox
is a transcended form of
Hell
and basically the trash corner of
times and realities
. It holds every
Demonverse
EVER.
The very middle of the Hellerox is known as
the Pentagramax
which is the ancient crystal of
The Almighty Being Chaos
which holds the barriers of the Hellerox itself, The Pentagramax holds the entire dimension of
Hell
inside itself and in hell the opening of the Pentagramax is in the deepest depths so deep that if anything was thrown into there,
It would be Erased from History
and into the Pentagramax it goes and the 8 eyes (counting the three on the back sides) are actually Openings to the main Realm of The Hellerox,
It is
BURNING, ITS BLAZING, ITS INFERNAL THE FIRES OF THE HELLEROX SHINES BRIGHTER THAN THE
LIGHT
