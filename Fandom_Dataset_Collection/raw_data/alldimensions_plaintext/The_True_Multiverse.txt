The True Multiverse contains every single universe from across every single loop while also completely transcending

the loops themselves. The True Multiverse is the first and smallest Post-Loop Verse.
An unfathomable size index
[

As Post-Loop verses are far beyond any previous measurements of size, we need a system that can measure these sorts of sizes. Well then, say hello to the PLSI (Post-Loop Size Index)! This size index is used for Post-Loop Verses. The size index goes something like this:
PLSI 0:
Any and all loops.
[
2
]
PLSI 1:
The True Multiverse as it transcends
[

]
the loops completely. However, in terms of size, compared to the other Post-Loop Verses, it falls incredibly short in this category.
PLSI 2:
A Possible "True Metaverse", this Verse would contain all Multiverses, including The True Multiverse, while also transcending the True Multiverse completely.
PLSI 3-4:
A Possible "True Xenoverse" and "True Hyperverse".
PLSI 5:
A "True Omniverse", it would contain all things with a lower PLSI than it.
PLSI 6:
A "True Box", similar to "The True Omniverse", but also containing all things that don't exist with a lower PLSI than it.
PLSI 7+
The point where things start to get interesting, at this point completely new and unique verses begin to utterly dominate. These verses deserve pages of their own. Due to most of the research on Post-Loop Verses being focused on The True Multiverse, it is up to people like you to research PLSI 7 and above verses!

Similar to "vastly" in the
Superloops
article, "transcending" in this article is on a scale unable to be described by
ANY
language.

This includes the Superloops and any extension beyond that.
