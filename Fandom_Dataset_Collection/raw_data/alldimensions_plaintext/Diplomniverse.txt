The
Diplomniverse
is a partial
power set
of
Archverses
within the
Omniverse
.
It contains partial Omniverses. With a half-life is around 6
Omniversal Gigayears
, it has degraded into an inexact structure over time, with duplicated Omniverses.
These
metalink
such that a change in one Omniverse is likely to cause a similar change in another.
Locations
[
]
The Core has a high density of Archverses, containing doubly exponential amounts relative to an average Omniverse. The Delta-Energy at this layer will re-arrange the Core's Omniverses; these effects are shielded by a rapidly expanding
outside
.
On the other hand, the Edge is more stable with a higher half-life and less duplication.
Veromniverse
[
]
The Veromniverses are an engineered structure around the Edge to fill in voids in a
Diplomniverse
where
Omniverses
aren't present. It filters through Omniverses with a low half-life, coating them in
Singularium
to increase size. This decreases mobility, an effect that can be paired with
Immoblium
.
