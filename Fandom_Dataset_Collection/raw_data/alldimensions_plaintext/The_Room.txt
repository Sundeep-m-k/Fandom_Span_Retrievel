A
Room
is the container of one or several
Tables
. They're made up of 4
Walls
, and also contain many other huge objects, such as
Chairs
,
Vases
,
Computers
,
Oak Trees
and many more objects.
The Rooms appear to be entirely coated in white coating. This coating has been known to reflect 100% of light and heat. Their ceilings have 8 bright lights. These lights give the entire Rooms a white look.
The walls, ceiling, and floor of a Room are made up of an unknown substance. The substance seems to be extremely durable and tough, a floor having even survived a big dose of
toxicium
from a lone
Blue Void
accidentally slipping from a Table and hitting the floor. The toxicium did absolutely nothing, not even a stain was present.
Again, it is unknown who built any Room or any of the other massive objects in them. The Rooms are way bigger than
Bongus
's power boundaries, however entities such as the
Primordial
and
THE CREATOR
can escape from one if they wish, but they decide not to.
The only living thing not found on Tables or Chairs in our Room is the
Shadow
. The creature lives under its local Table and has been fond of eating it. No one knows why it does that.
The Door With A Door Handle
is the only way out of any Room.
And maybe one day, that picture will have the things in the text.
