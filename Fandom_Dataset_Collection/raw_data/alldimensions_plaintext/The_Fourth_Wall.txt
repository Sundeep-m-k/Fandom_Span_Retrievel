Hello there traveler, never thought A wall that Exists in an infinite number of forms, realities, and can bend past existence would shield everything? well It's here, and it is made of a lot of different things, we have no idea what is past it, but it seems that there are still cracks in the fourth wall.

Infinite theory
[
]
There is in countable amount of uncountable infinite number of universes, and with multiverses, metaverses, yotaverses, boxes, barrels, havens, hells, Etc.
The fourth wall on the other hand, there is only one, containing the countable amount of uncountable infinite number of universes, and with multiverses, metaverses, yotaverses, boxes, barrels, havens, hells, Etc.
Structure
[
]
The Fourth wall is made of many parts, but the three main parts are the inner, middle, and outer region.
Inner Region
[
]
The inner region is where Everything is contained, only a number of us made it too here. Its gravity is undefined as large amounts of pure Graviton clusters can be found and mined here, and There is this nylon fabric that makes up this (wall alloy) or to put it more simply, Its pure fabric of reality, or F.O.R. There is a rare chance the fabric is torn so we can get into the middle of the wall. But in population, there is only about 1 countable infinite people, and because the fourth wall is Who knows how big it is, it's rare to find life, unless you're in a group, which has about 100 people/living things.
Middle Region
[
]
Also known as the inside of wall, cracks in the wall are rare, and impossible, There are an countable infinite amount of cities and who knows how many cracks in the wall But the inside of the wall, kind of feels like the Minecraft farlands, and with cool minerals, we have no idea on the atomic structure, as there is only 1 countable amount of science equipment, and like I said on how big the fourth wall is, a countable infinite is N O T big at all but we usually just mine the inside of the wall, but only the actual mineable ores, we cannot mine the wall... Yet...
Outer Region
[
]
There is no proof on what the wall is outside, one person in my city says that we are just an insanely small particle, and that makes us the smallest particle in one "verse". Another person says that this is the mainframe of the simulation. And another person thinks that this is a layer to a mining game. I honestly think that that is the stupidest piece of "Shaking Hot Ice Tea" ever.
The instability
[
]
This is a part of the wall where it is corrupted, pockets of this is uncommon
Whitespace
[
]
these pockets of anti-void is a safe spot, huge pockets have cities in this anti-void
Minerals
[
]
Its about risk and reward, the risk is finding it, and getting to the fourth wall, the reward is extremely cool ores.
Electrike
[
]
Pure electricity, Minable, kills you if you use metal to mine it because metal conducts electricity It powers everything here, so it's still useful.
Graviton
[
]
Has its own gravitational pull, and it makes the fourth wall's gravity extremely wonky
Mythril
[
]
There is an infinite number of universes and an infinite number of universes where fiction actually exists. Prove me wrong
Hyperium
[
]
It is a white mineral full of power and energy, It gets tinted yellow if seen to "the instability" Witch is at the middle of the fourth wall, it wants us to keep out, is this proof that something wants us out? I have no idea.
Noise
[
]
This is a static like ore, we named it after "Noise generation", we have no use of the ore yet, we need ideas and we are using the internet to ask for ideas
Nulhaze
[
]
Pure -null shards, if it shatters or gets ground up, It turns into nildust, witch usually happens
Entropyr
[
]
White blinding ore, We use it as frashlights without batteries
Inversium
[
]
This ore has properties beyond our research, we have no idea
Atomium
[
]
because of the fourth wall being wonkey, size can be broken, this is proof, and if you split it it will just split, and if you split the part, and then it explodes we will research on it
Havacon
[

Named after the god from a universes my friend suggested "Havax" this rare ore is pure chaos or havoc.
