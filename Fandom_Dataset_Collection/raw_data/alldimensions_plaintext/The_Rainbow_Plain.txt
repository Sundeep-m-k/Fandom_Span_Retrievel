The
Rainbow Plain
is the eighth and last step in the
color plains chain
. Weirdly, every part of this place has the same properties as the plain with the same color. Here their properties:
Red part
: Hot and life cant exists commonly.
Orange part
: Shiny, good temperature and capable of having life. This is where the smaller plains exists.
Yellow part
: Same as orange. Also contains life.
Green part
: Like orange and yellow, but a bit colder. Less life that in yellow and orange parts.
Blue part
: enormous seas with a good temperature to have life. Has the least amount of life compared to the other habitable plains, tho.
Purple part
: Like red, but a lot hotter.
Weirdly, there isnt a white part in this multi-colored plain.
