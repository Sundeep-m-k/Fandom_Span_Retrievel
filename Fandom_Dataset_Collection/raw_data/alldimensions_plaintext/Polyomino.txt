are figures created by attaching multiple
squares
edge-to-edge. They are sorted based upon the number of squares they have.

Henominoes
[
]
There is a single henomino, consisting of one
square
by itself.
Dominoes
[
]
There is a single domino, consisting of two
squares
attached edge to edge.
Trominoes
[
]
There are two trominoes: the I tromino, consisting of three
squares
attached in a straight line, and the L tromino, consisting of a square with two other
squares
attached to the top and bottom.
Tetrominoes
[
]
There are five tetrominoes - the square tetromino (consisting of four
squares
in a
square
shape), the line tetromino (consisting of four
squares
in a straight line), the T tetromino (consisting of a
square
with three
squares
attached directly to it) and the L tetromino (consisting of three
squares
in a line then an additional
square
on the bottom at a right angle).
The tetromino with the largest
edge length
is the line tetromino, with an
edge length
of
9
l
{\displaystyle 9 l}
. The tetromino with the smallest
edge length
is the square tetromino, with an
edge length
of
4
l
{\displaystyle 4l}
.
Pentominoes
[
]
There are twelve pentominoes. These are named, by their approximate shape:
Line pentomino
L pentomino
P pentomino
R pentomino
S pentomino
T pentomino
U pentomino
V pentomino
W pentomino
X pentomino
Y pentomino
Z pentomino
The pentomino with the largest
edge length
is the line pentomino, with an
edge length
of
12
l
{\displaystyle 12 l}
. The pentomino with the smallest
edge length
is the P pentomino, with an
edge length
of
9
l
{\displaystyle 9 l}
.
