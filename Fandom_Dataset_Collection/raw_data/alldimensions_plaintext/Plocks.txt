Plox/Plock
Plox
, or
Plocks
, are employees/employers of the
Barrel Factory
. They appear to have a Black exterior with a pointy heads. They have a white face that gives them the appearance of a baby. They are also the inhabitants of the
Rainbowcosmos
. They have no gender and have an average I.Q. of 1,000, which is far greater than the average human's. Their skin absorbs all of the colors of the Rainbow cosmos, which is why this text is not rainbow in appearance. Their 1-dimensional personality and appearance have no meaning, which is why this text is white. This is also why water is not

(disregard those rediculous statements).  Their regular diet is Rainbow eggs and ham, including other edible anomolies that are too complex to describe. They make products such as food soup (e.g. meat soup, chicken soup, Ice soup, hot soup, thicc soup🥵, Rainbow soup, etc...), as well as barrels, which tend to contain canned beef soup, which actually consists of the organs of many delicious animals, such as pork, rabbit, herring, and humans (they are not to be considered as cannibals; they are just doing their jobs). Their point of existence is to provide service to a variety of interdemmensional customers by fulfilling the role of an organization's suppliers.
There are different sects of plox/plocks.  The primary sector that resides on the first floor of the company is the dark sector.  The dark sect consists of plox/plocks which have been described previously in the first paragraph.  They carry out the role of suppling and registering barrels and items.  Remember what was stated in the first paragraph regarding their lobotomized personality?  Disregard that ridiculous statement, as B
lack Plocks
are the only ones who pertain to that personality (Yes, this is Power Rangers now, deal with it).
Green Plocks
are a bit more on the bubbly side.  Located in the vagrant sector (miscellaneous botany and lab-rat sector), these types task themselves out of hubris with the most fun-tastic of enterprises.  These Plocks also tend to have dissacociative personality disorder (DID) because they're so
fUn!
(Like, really fun).  From balancing on top of Oogles and Earth's beach balls into their designated vicinities, to type writing love poems to customers about the deliciously esteemed cooked soup, these Plocks put the Oomph (h is silent) in Oompaloompa Crazy!1!  Red Plocks, located in the "lais·sez-faire" (thanks a lot, Google) sector, these no-monkey-business, hard-headed, tuxedo-tattered go getters know how to get from plan A (get this) to plan B (no laughing they're serious business).  These plocks sure do know how to achieve their goals in a realistic, practical way - except when they don't!  In such case, they form what is know the hive mind, pilling themselves on top of one another in an endless sea of red in order to reach concensus on risk management, market trends, as well as sustainability and ESG (Environmental, social, and governance factors).
