Blue
The
Greater Blueverse
is a very large type of verse, which is obviously blue. They contain all of the
blueverses
in existence including the ones outside of
living multiverses
. They're hyperspheres of many dimensions, existing through them, so they can pretty much exist in lower dimensions too, allowing 3d entities to interact with all of these.
Civilization
[
]
Our local Greater Blueverse is inhabited by an extremely advanced civilization known as atrua or the blue civilization, which has access to all of its resources, and also uses them all as efficiently as possible. Our verse is considered to be some kind of state for them, having three large cities made by them on it, with the most populated one being closest to the center (it's also the capital), and the other two are slightly closer to the edges. Currently, the blue civlization is staying within our Greater Blueverse as there are dangerous threats to them outside of it, but they have plans to expand into the
void
soon.
Protective shells
[
]
These verses have a naturally occuring protective shell to protect themselves from
Cosmic Needles
, and ours has since been expanded by the aforementioned civilization in order to be 25% thicker. as such, it is impervious to all Cosmic Needles, even the type II ones. Approximately 790,000
OYC
ago a cosmic needle hit our Greater Blueverse's outer shell, obliteratinga big chunk of the verse. Thankfully it has since been restored fully, and the shell has been repaired.
