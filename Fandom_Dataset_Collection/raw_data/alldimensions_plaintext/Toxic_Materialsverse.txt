Toxic Materialsverse
Clearest image of the Toxic Materialsverse. Intense glitches and effects from the substances within affecting the camera.Dark circle is not the verse, in fact being a circle-like field around the verse rapidly changing "color".

The image above, but with the approximate location of the Toxic Materialsverse overlayed as a picture of a
Universe
. Due to the effects of additional glitchy substances, the overlay is slightly messed up.
The
Toxic Materialsverse
is a
verse
that, like the name suggests, has many different toxic/dangerous
materials
inside. Due to the sheer amount and size of said materials, the Toxic Materialsverse is extremely corrupted, more so than almost any other known verse ever.

Non-exclusive to this verse
[

Substances
known in other places findable in the Toxic Materialsverse include
Glitchonicite
,
Purialiconicite
,
Toxicium
,
Corruptite
,
Esdubleveium
,
Hyperradioactive Elements
,
ICantium
,
Primordium Omega
,
Glitch Matter
, and
Cuandaic Acid
. All of these substances are dangerous in some way to at least a certain (approximately 5 billion) amount of
creatures
in some way.
There are also many substances in the Toxic Materialsverse known to be exclusive to said verse. Many of these substances have a
particle
in them which denotes their exclusivity to the Toxic Materialsverse, named Particle TM (or PTM). A Particle TM is unable to be synthesized nor isolated from an exclusive particle, for unknown reasons. Some 'exclusives' have no Particle TM, leading researchers to hypothesize that they can be found elsewhere, but they have not been discovered elsewhere.
Exclusive to this verse
[
]
This is only an abridged list; there are approximately 21,322,981,000 exclusive materials estimated to be in the Toxic Materialsverse total.
Glitchonicite
-like substances
[
]
Error four oh fourium
[
]
Also known as Error 404ium or Error404ium, this substance does many of the same things Glitchonicite is able to do, but every time an organism utilizes it in some way, they will utter in the language they know best "Error four oh four not found", and then enter a comatose state. If the organism does not know a(the) word(s) that make up the utterance, or the language does not have (a) word(s) for a word in the utterance, the word will be replaced by its
English
equivalent.
The composition of Error404ium is similar to Glitchonicite, except there is a
Skidiri Quark
with a Mike Value of 404, and a Particle TM.
Scor-Glitchonicite
[
]
Acts like heated Glitchonicite at all times.
The composition of Scor-Glitchonite is of
Unknown String
, an isolatable + synthesizable particle not seen elsewhere, and a Particle TM.
Malfunctionicite
[
]
Able to do everything Glitchonicite can do, but at a reduced capacity.
The composition of Malfunctionicite is the same as Glitchonicite, but reduced by ~43.1%, and a Particle TM.
Unique
[
]
Data Corrupticite
[
]
Able to corrupt any data written about it. [DATA CORRUPTED].
[DATA CORRUPTED]
The composition of Data Corrupticite is [DATA CORRUPTED], as well as [DATA CORRUPTED] and a Particle TM.
Toxic Materialite
[
]
A very unstable and dangerous particle with unknown effects, possibly at least with almost every effect of every other substance in the Toxic Materialsverse.
[DATA CORRUPTED]
The composition of Toxic Materialite is entirely Particle TM. Impurities are impossible, as any get ejected, annihilated, or assimilated at random. A single Particle TM is unable to be isolated from Toxic Materialite, but it is not indesructable; a piece of Toxic Materialite is able to be divided into chunks.
