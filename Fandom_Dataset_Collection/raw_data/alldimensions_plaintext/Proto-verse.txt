Proto-verses
are very small/unstable
universes
, they appear all the time everywhere in every
multiverse
. They only last at most a trillionth of a second each which is why it makes them so unstable.
In the time they do survive they quickly produce even smaller particles that have a temperature of 5 trillion kelvin. These Proto-verses are about the size of one
string
.
You can see they vary in shape and sizes, the most common one being spheres and ovoids.
The true nature of Proto-verses is unknown but is predicted to be the same as an universe.
