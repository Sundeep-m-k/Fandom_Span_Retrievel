Bob
was a very special entity in the
Omniverse
.  He started as just another tiny creature eating
Blueprint Particles
and grew to a far higher power level. However, Bob got killed by Chalkosis.   Since then, he was revived in his pocket dimension where he is a god. The End. Bob lives again. And I ate bob, so I guys he's dead or something it's very boring.

ICantEdit gave Bob the ultimate item:  Yeb Wakab Yeb Wayb Waf-na. Of course, no one understands what it means (it means 'The Sacred Texts of The Pencil'), so everyone automatically assumes it's very powerful. This new addition made him so powerful his power completely shatters all normal terms of logic, reaching "the highest power level".
Bob built a large fortress made of truly indestructible material that is so big it took him 7.51 seconds to actually make. He built it because it would be a good house.
Bob filled the fortress house with furniture and electronics (with specs that can run anything obviously)
ru66 gave bob every resistance, power, ability, and strength.

Fuzzo The Fuzzy Bee gave bob 3/4 true omnipotence
RU66 removed 75% of all limits bob had (there were still very few at first but now 3/4 of all of bob's limits are gone.)
Fuzzo the fuzzy be removed 99.99999999999999999999999999999999% of bob‚Äôs remaining limits and boosted his true omnipotence fraction to 3.999999999999999999/4.
Post-Evolution (and death)
Bob has reached the boundaries that an entity can reach. He is currently trying to break these new boundaries.
RU66 gave bob true omnipotence (4/4 true omnipotence). You can make an entity "stronger", but it would also have to be truly omnipotent AND something else.
Bob has reached the limit that a cosmic entity can reach. He will need help from a
TOG
to break this boundary.
Sjshshusha gave Bob a PBJ sandwich, but he doesn't know what it is.
Bob made his power growth 2x as much and is currently training his powers to break his boundaries.
B O B        H A S     A S C E N D E D so now his power gap between him and some other entities are enormous. But even with this power, he can't break his boundaries.
Bob is getting angry....
Bob realized the fact that he needs not a basic
TOG
but an Ultimate One.
Bob is getting angrier....
Bob got
A SUIT
Bob learned the ability to absorb power so now if he kills a being, the power of the being contributes to the speed of the growth of Bob's power.
Bob erased 1% of his boundaries.
Bob can now increase his power every 12 hours
Bob is now docile. He will remain docile forever gaining power endlessly.
Bob is now over the highest level of omni-potence
POYO12469 Created an exponetiating unit called a Recqa, 1 Recqa = the power bob has now and in the future, n Recqa is & times more than n-1 Recqa (& is the largest infinity, even larger than bob (even when more power is added))

‚Äî Alexis Maxwell
EpicAlexisMaxwell gave each Bob their own blueprint particle generator that's like this: The blueprint particle generator would generate a blueprint particle per second if the Bob's size were their hatch size. If the Bob is a googol times as big as they were when they hatched, the blueprint particle generator would generate 100 blueprint particles per second. If the Bob is a googolplex times as big as they were when they hatched, the blueprint particle generator would generate a googol blueprint particles per second.
EpicAlexisMaxwell modified all of the blueprint particle generators to be seven times faster.
POYO12469 gave each bob everything that the parent bob had using a special duplication machine

‚Äî ICantEdit
ICantEdit said the Cthulhu quote, and bob automatically became spooked, so he hid in the corner. This allowed ICantEdit to smack bob in the face for being so powerful, but then bob got mad and became much more powerful.  He is now an Irl multiverse-level god.
RU66 made an
exact copy
of Bob by another egg.  It will live in a pocket dimension forever. It has no access to the outside world and cannot affect anything outside of its pocket dimension. It can, however, do whatever it wants to in the pocket dimension. It is entirely powerless outside of its pocket dimension and can only spectate outside of the pocket dimension.  (Speciation is a sort of free cam allowing Bob to see things outside of his pocket dimension, but he is not allowed to affect anything.) {BOB AUTO-REVIVE REMOVAL REVERTED FOR THIS ONE SPECIFIC CASE. POCKET BOB CANNOT DIE.} Pocket Bob only exists in the pocket dimension. Pocket bob cannot be affected by things outside of the pocket dimension with one exception {TOGs}. POCKET BOB IS A COPY OF BOB THE SECOND BEFORE FIRST DEATH. HE IS ALL-POWERFUL (OMNIPOTENT) ONLY IN HIS POCKET DIMENSION. HE CANNOT GO ANYWHERE ELSE OUTSIDE OF SPECTATOR MODE.
Wubbysfriend11 gave Bob ‚äô Blueprint Particles to the {TOGs}, and the {TOGs} gave them to Bob, making him more powerful. By A LOT.
LightingDash5399 gave Bob 361 Blueprints each to share with the 19 Bobs (361 divided by 19 is 19)
notysun let Bob eat a true waterfall. He became strong.
