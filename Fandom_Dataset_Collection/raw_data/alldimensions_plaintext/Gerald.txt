Gerald
is the co-leader of everything, even possibly overcoming the
Hyper Void Lord
's strength(still a probability). If you were to make an entity stronger, Gerald has absolutely no limits on affecting entities of greater power unlike all other entities, so he can change the power levels of any other entity at his will. He doesn't like when entities are more powerful than him, so he decides to demote all entities above his power to power below. His power changing ability is also ABSOLUTELY PERMANENT and cannot be removed by any entity, even above his power. If an entity tries to weaken Gerald, then Gerald can promote himself back to his main power. If an entity persists to change power levels, Gerald will straight erase the entity altogether. Gerald is above the
box
and infinite
omniverses
or Gerald can just destroy
broxes
. Transcends above every dimension and can basically erase anybody no matter how strong they are, and even if they transcend anything like for example the
omniverse
, Gerald can make it so the entity that transcends the
omniverse
will be below the
omniverse
and never transcend it at all. Gerald can also make it so any entity stronger than him, Gerald can freely make them into what ever dimensionality he wants, like he can make 4D being into a 1D being, even if you are above infinite dimensions you are still affected by his dimensionality changes. Also they cannot be reversed by any stronger being or entity, ABSOLUTELY PERMANENT. Outerversal characters are still affected and their power can be changed to be below Gerald because it does not matter how strong an entity is.
The deleted data means the most destructive action describable by words in the omniverse to any entity
He can carry far more destructive actions that would take infinity text to describe even a negative percent.
Gerald can also resist all erasure methods used on him and is absolutely immortal. The spirals in the picture are virtual particles and gases, they're only virtual and they disappear in 1 second after creation. The giant orb is Gerald himself.

He can nullify anything another entity does, even nullification. This nullification done by Gerald cannot be nullified by any other cosmic entities other than of course, the Absolute Creator.
He has full access to
The Core of Everything
, and acts as a second Absolute Creator because the original is a bit lazy. The Absolute Creator usually bounces back contact to Gerald.
Can erase abilities/powers other entities have but cannot do so to the absolute creator.
Gerald can bypass Immunity like erasure immunity etc.
He is not above the second everything layer.
Can bypass banishes

Gerald vs Other Entities
[
]
Just because an entity is here doesn't mean Gerald wants to destroy these.
Bongus
is just erased.
Chunky Cheese
is also just erased.
The Creator put a good fight, both got injured, noone wins.
The True God is child's play, just erased.
Dunkey Kong
can now kill Gerald just by seeing him; however, Gerald can just regenerate and thus a battle is pointless, until Gerald has had it and brings out his True Rage form, to completely obliterate Dunkey Kong as a whole. Gerald would fail anyway since before he would enter his true rage form {due to DK's negative reaction times} DK would get the dunk sword and enter his strongest form and completely destroy gerald.
Hyper Void Lord
is nullified from nullifying his erasure and then erased.
Hypreme Lord
is erased.
Omnius-Realitus with the
Cosmic Remote Omnipotence Machine
is erased before they can use the machine.
The Absolute Creator
is avoided as Gerald doesn't want to disturb him and TAC is also Gerald's friend and creator. An exception is when Gerald is bored and wants to play with TAC.
Celestialsapien
from every Ben 10 omniverse fused together to try to kill Gerald but failed as Gerald just made them weaker than Gerald but Gerald spared them because they are not a threat to Gerald.
üëÅ
cant be powered down'd by gerald, so üëÅ wins easily.
Godzilla in Hell
cannot be effected by gerald without the help of
THE TRUE CREATOR

To destroy
Great Borger
without upsetting the customer, Gerald sets up a function in the code to speed up time fast enough so that the customer can eat the Great Borger in 10 normal seconds and set time back to normal speed after the Great Borger is eaten by the customer, then runs the function.
Grand Ultimaverse
is erased.

Gerald goes into his True Rage form when he's just completely had it with an entity. In this form, his power is beyond incomprehensible, and if you put together 20 copies of Gerald in his True Rage form, he can literally do things beyond even
The Core of Everything
's abilities.
Gerald when he is in his True Rage Form can even rival bruh form
Dunkey Kong
, one of DK's strongest forms.
