The
Subfinal Verse
, as you may expect, is a type of verse directly before the final verse in
the Extended Hierarchy
, and it is contained by the
True Waterfall
and
all of its candidates
. This verse contains
Final Finals
and their first, second, third, etc.
Archrealities
. It also contains some other objects, which will now be described in detail.

Section 1: The Galaxy
[
]
Almost all of the Subfinal Verse, averaging around 95% of it (depends on the time, but approximately every 1.75
OYC
the size of the Galaxy returns to where it was before) is taken up by an object called 'the Galaxy'. Unsurprisingly, it is shaped like a four-armed spiral galaxy, and it has a hole in the center. This is where almost all Final Finals and their Archrealities are found.

Composition
[
]
There are 3 recognized layers of the Galaxy:
The Outer Spiral: This part contains the blue and purple areas of the Galaxy, mostly containing stray, broken objects, sections or megastructures of Final Finals.
The Inner Torus: This section actually contains Final Finals, with higher Archrealities being closer to the center of the Galaxy.
The hole section: This is definitely the most interesting part of the Galaxy. The center of this section is completely empty, having a strong repulsive force to most types of matter.

The Outer Spiral
[
]
As mentioned, the Outer Spiral does not contain verses, only structures and objects from Final Finals. It also contains small clouds of hydrogen, helium, and lithium.
For more information, see the
Final Final
.
Because the parts of the Outer Spiral are less massive then Final Finals, it only makes sense that they would stray away from the center of the Galaxy. The reason that Final Finals may fall apart is currently unknown, but it may be that these portions formed into Final Finals.
The Inner Torus
[
]
The Inner Torus contains nearly all the Final Finals found within the Subfinal Verse. These Final Finals are packed together tightly, and very rarely one may find small concrete buildings, sometimes containing books of various languages. They orbit the center of the Galaxy in a clockwise orientation.
The hole
[
]
Although it is almost completely empty, the center of the Galaxy has an extremely strong repulsive force balanced out by the gravity from the other two layers. Light can enter, but basically nothing else.
A second similar verse
can be seen from the other side, although we have not been successful in entering it.
Section 2: The Dodecahedra
[
]
The second section of the Subfinal Verse contains two different kinds of dodecahedra, the more common green and the less common white (90% of dodecahedra are green, the other 10% are white). The green dodecahedra absorb and use light like plants, and even duplicate themselves after around 2 OYC. Because of this, green dodecahedra are thought to actually be alive.
The green and white dodecahedra.
The white dodecahedra are not nearly as interesting. Mostly transparent, they are made of a glass-like material and it is about as thick as a
Box
. The inside has lots of white dusty particulates that give the white dodecahedra its color. It is theorized that there may be some almost-invisible dodecahedra without dust that have not been discovered, but this theory is very unlikely.
It is unknown why these are shaped specifically like dodecahedra. The currently documented laws show that it would be impossible for one of these to form, although it may be possible that laws changed in the past, or that the laws may change in a cycle. However, other than the existence of dodecahedra, there is no evidence that any of these theories are true.
Section 3: The Barrier
[
]
The final main section of the Subfinal Verse is the barrier of it. It is actually relatively easy to pass, acting almost like paper. It is also almost transparent, and sometimes small fractal formations can be found. One of these fractals in the barrier is a planet-like object, shaped like a sphere on a smaller sphere on a smaller  sphere on a smaller sphere...
The Planet
[
]
This planet (currently unnamed) is mostly made of large mountain ranges and acid rivers. It has an atmosphere mostly made of oxygen, but approximately every 10 OYC it disappears for an unknown reason. Surprisingly, life can still exist here. It has been measured to be approximately
‚àû

{\displaystyle \infin(0,\omega)}
light-years in size.
Mountainous Life
[
]
The mountains contain almost no atmosphere almost all the time, so all known life is found underground, out of the cold temperatures. The bottom of the food chain contains mostly worm-like creatures (species vary in size between 0.1-1000 millimeters) that eat rocks to grow, and they are preyed on mostly by very large beetle-like species that are blind and burrow underground.
Usually, the further down you go on the mountain, the further you go on the food chain, until eventually it is possible to breathe through the atmosphere. Many mammal-like animals prey on the beetles, and these species breathe oxygen and can see. For the most part, these are at the top of the food chain.
Aquatic Life
[
]
The rivers, being made of acid, do not contain much life, except of the single-celled kind. This is thought to be where life started on the planet.
Surface Life
[
]
The surface of the planet has mostly small plants, and they will retract into the ground when the atmosphere begins depleting, and will basically be in a hibernation state. Because of the whole atmosphere problem, most animals are small and burrow underground, although some flying birds have evolved to not need oxygen, so they are just ground-dwelling animals when the atmosphere is gone.
Underground Life
[
]
Most of the life on the planet stays underground all the time, either preying on plants when they retract or on other animals. Most of them are blind.
