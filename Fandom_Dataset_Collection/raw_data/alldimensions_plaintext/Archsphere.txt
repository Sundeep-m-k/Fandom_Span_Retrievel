An
Archsphere
(once referred to as THE Archverse) is a structure that bends spacetime and controls reality within its domain. Our Archsphere is home to what is known as the Archvoid and the
Feeshverse
. Due to the presence of this Archvoid, entering or exiting the Archsphere is extremely difficult, and this is on purpose to protect the vacuum inside from the vacuum of the
Hendaverse
. Many Archspheres exist and all have varying amounts of "layers". Therefore, an Archsphere's
AO
is ω.
