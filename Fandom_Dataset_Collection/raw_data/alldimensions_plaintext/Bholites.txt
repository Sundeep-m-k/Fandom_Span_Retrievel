Bholite Ds are like a middleground between B and A. They have full function, but seem to be much dumber than Bholite A. They do not have communication ability. They seem to intentionally avoid the cameras, which means that no images have been taken of a Bholite D.

Bholite Alphas appear to be the only thing capable of escaping the "realm", as it has been seen simply phasing through the barrier of it. It has also been seen phasing in and out of existence and shapeshifting. They are also the least common, and most recently discovered. Further testing and research required. No image has currently been captured.
