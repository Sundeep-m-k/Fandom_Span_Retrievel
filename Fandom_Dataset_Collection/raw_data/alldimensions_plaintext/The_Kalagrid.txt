The Kalagrid
Very far picture of a Kalagrid. Each pixel is around 4
Kalanomnihedrons
. The voids are too small to be seen.

Kalanomnihedrons
Kalagrids
are collossal grids of
Kalanomnihedrons
. They are laid out in a honeycomb pattern, although they have large voids inbetween them. Kalagrids are normally encased by a Kalacasing.

Voids
[
]
Kalanomnihedrons have an omniforce (called the
Kalaforce
) that tries to separate them which reaches out to ~3x their size. This causes voids to appear in the middle of them. These voids have a density of 1 blueprint particle per œâ ly, so they basically have literally nothing.
Kalacasing
[
]
Kalacasings are the things that encase Kalagrids. They are composed of an infinite amount of rods (remember that all of these verses have infinite dimensions) that have a wierd property that causes them to form types of zones between them that keep the Kalanomnihedrons from escaping.
Kalacasings are only stable due to the outward Kalaforces preventing them from collapsing in on themselves, so they collapse shortly after their Kalagrid dies.
Kalagrid viewed from the outside with its Kalacasing visible.
History
[
]
Kalagrids are formed when the pseudo-particles inside a
Proto-Kalaverse
collapse into one of two states. If they collapse into the first state, they deploy special programmed particles that have a piece of
blueprint gene
code that makes them start rapidly duplicating, however they have an algorithm that tells them when to turn and make forks. This results in the construction of a Kalacasing in
!Ã∂
years. The pseudo-particles, however, still have an extremely high amound of energy, so they create zones with unstable energies. These energies have a property that makes them unstable but in an orderly way, which makes them start creating
Kalanomnihedrons
in an orderly fashion, eventually filling the entire Kalagrid up. When the whole Kalagrid is filled, the energies fully stabilise and stop creating Kalanomnihedrons.
Death
[
]
Kalagrids normally start dying when their first Kalanomnihedrons collapse. This collapse causes a lot of empty space that the adjacent Kalanomnihedrons rush into, which disorganises and destabilises the grid. There is eventually a time when the repulsion force speeds a Kalanomnihedron so fast that collides with another Kalanomnihedron, collapsing them both and starting a chain reaction of collisions that collapse the entire Kalagrid. Kalacasings can last for a big longer, but they also collapse in on themselves without the outward Kalaforces in Œ© years.
