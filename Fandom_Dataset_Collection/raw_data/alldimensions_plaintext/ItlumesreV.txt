ItlumesreV
is a very eventful place because the inuesreV inside of it do not have a barrier at the edge, but the pressure in ItlumesreV is so high that it gives them a pseudo-barrier of compressed
OP water
that takes up 40% of the whole ItlumesreV. Because of the immense pressure in the ItlumesreV, some of it actually gets crushed against dimensional barriers and becomes a nonexistesphere, which prevents an area of space from being accessed by making a portal on all sides of it each of which lead to the opposite side. These are actually common occurences in ItlumesreV and can even form around a inuesreV, making it inacessible and inescapable forever.
Surprisingly, lots of life exists in ItlumesreV, this is because there are shredded power leaves shredded throughout the OP water in it, making any life that happens to be created from particles in the water very powerful and able to swim through the OP water with ease. a lot of these organisms are like more powerful
Pointlessly Omnipotent Worms
because most of them are not very complex or thoughtful.
There have been many instances where entire ItlumesreV were swallowed whole because one of the beings inside of them gained power greater than several end be all gods and absorbed ItlumesreV, granting them huge amounts of power. These beings are classified as Terror Evils and are a serious threat to all ItlumesreV. There are even civilizations in ItlumesreV with the sole goal of stopping organisms from growing into Terror Evils before it's too late.
