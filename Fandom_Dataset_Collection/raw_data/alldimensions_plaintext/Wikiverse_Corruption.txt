A Wikiverse Corruption is the phenomenon in which the page of the “Wikiverse” on the
Wikiverse
itself
loops
back to Earth. It is unsure if this loop is in the same
Everything Layer
or not, but every time this loop happens, the wiki keeps corrupting into something eventually unrecognizable. If you go to the Wikiverse page and keep clicking “Contained By”, you will eventually reach the earth in its first loop. Is this in some kind of greater reality, or is it simply the same? Nobody knows.
The Wikiverse after being looped ten times
After about 25 loops, the Wikiverse corrupts so much to the point where it is completely unrecognizable. One example of the corruption is that in the first loop of
Earth
, the image is slightly corrupted. It does make sense for the corruption’s loops to be on a separate Everything Layer, but why and how would it?
