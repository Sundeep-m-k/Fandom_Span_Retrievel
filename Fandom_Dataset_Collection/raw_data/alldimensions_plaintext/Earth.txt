The Moon
Earth
is the 3rd planet from the
Sun
, as well as the largest rocky planet in the
Solar System
. It is also the first planet to have a moon, which is unsurprisingly called "
The Moon
", as it was the
first moon discovered and named.
Earth
is also the most studied, well known, loved, taken care of and understood object in our
Universe
and has been since our very first primates and hominids firstly observed the landscapes and world around them.
Earth is one of the smallest planets in the Solar System. it is 12.756 km in equatorial diameter. It's actually 318 times less massive than Jupiter. It's nearly 10 times smaller in diameter than the mighty giant planet Saturn. Yet, Earth is more massive than all the rocky planets combined. The masses of Mercury, Venus and Mars combined, make up only 98% of the mass of Earth. Earth is just the largest rocky planet.
Earth is also a planet that has a great abundance of chemicals. It is the most dense of all the planets in the entire Solar System. Its density is 5.51 g/cm³. As it is the most abundant planet in chemicals, including oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, calcium, iron, magnesium etc. etc., Earth has life. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth, since the very beginning of life are thought extinct. Approximately 8.1 billion people currently live on Earth, but we will likely pass that number and reach 11 billion until 2065 or so.

Origins
[
]
Earth formed nearly 4.543.000.000 years ago. It was formed a little while after the Sun formed. Earth was formed because there was a lot of materials left after the extremely violent formation of the Sun. Many of these rocks and metals were clumped together. The big planet, Jupiter, entered the Solar System, breaking up some of the materials that formed the inner rocky planets.
Many rocks and metal created the inner rocky planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, while
Jupiter
was moved away from the Sun, by the formation of
Saturn
. The asteroid belt exists between
Jupiter
and
Mars
, since Jupiter prevents asteroids from forming into another planet. Thankfully, Earth was in the habitable zone, where it was safe and sound with liquid water that came from meteors, and Earth could have life.
Composition
[
]
A diagram showing multiple layers of Earth
Earth
is made out of the crust, mantle, the outer core, and the inner core.
[
1
]
The Crust
[
]
The crust
layer contains
oceanic crust and continental crust,
which together make up the tectonic plates. Lithospheric processes,
such as earthquakes
, also happen here, thanks to immense siesmic energy being released from the tectonic plates.
[
2
]
[
3
]
Earth's crust contains a lot of chemicals that are vital for life and survival. Earth's oceanic crust makes up 70,8% while the rest 29,2% is made up of the crust of land.
Earth's interior. Open image in new tab to see it better.
The crust's width ranges from 5 to 70 km. The mantle and crust are separated by the
Mohorovicic discontinuity
, where earthquakes sharply increase in speed (1 km/s +).
[
4
]
Volcanic eruptions also happen, along with earthquakes, spitting materials out of the crust to the surface.
The Mantle
[
]
The mantle
is divided into
the upper and lower mantle
, here, 100 to 200 km from the surface, rock reaches its melting point, upon which, it is turned into magma and later ejected out as
lava
. The outermost layer of the mantle, the
Asthenosphere
, is the molten matrix into which colliding tectonic plates,
also known as
Subduction zones
, strike deep into.
[
5
]
Olivine
,
pyroxenes
,
garnets
,
spinels
,
perovskite
and
ferropericlase
minerals are all found and created in the mantle.
[
6
]
Separating the mantle and core is the
Gutenberg discontinuity
,
otherwise known as the
D" layer
. This is where seismic waves
completely disappear, as the core below is liquid
.
[

]
The Core
[
]
The interior of Earth, as scientists depict it.
The core of earth is primarily made from an iron-nickel alloy, as well as other heavy elements, such as lead and uranium.
[
8
]
In the past, Earth was mostly radioactive, but as temperature increased, iron and nickel were allowed to move more freely, creating the core. This caused gravitational potential energy to release, melting the entire core and covering it in silicate magma.
[
9
]
This event, dubbed the
iron catastrophe
, gave the
Earth
the
magnetosphere
, shielding it from most of the Sun's radioactivity.
The outer core is a low-viscosity, molten, nickel-iron encasing of the inner core. Inside of the outer core,
eddy currents
happen,
which are electrical currents that are thought to give the
Earth
its magnetic field.
Unlike the outer core,
the inner core is a completely solid, possibly being a single, giant iron crystal with temperatures of 5,400 to 5,700 Kelvin.
The inner core is thought to be slowly growing, due to the inner-outer core boundary cooling
100 °C per a billion years
.
It is also theorized that the inner core rotates very slightly faster than the earth, about 0.3 - 0.5 degrees per year more than
Earth
.

The Atmosphere
[
]
A diagram deatailing the structure of the atmosphere.
The atmosphere of
Earth
is mostly comprised of N
2
(78%), O
2
(21%), argon (>1%), CO
2
(>0.03%) and more. Earth's atmosphere also contains water vapor. The clouds that exist in the atmosphere are actually water that evaporates, because of the Sun.
The further one goes, the thinner and lighter the atmosphere becomes, with the first 11 km on the surface making up 3/4 of all of its weight.
[
11
]
The atmosphere is divided into 5 main layers, the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and exosphere.
Troposphere
[
]
This is the first and shortest atmospheric layer, going from the surface and thinning out at 12 km at the
tropopause
. It is the heaviest and warmest of atmospheres. Most of
Earth
's water vapor ends up here (99%), as its cooling point is too high to reach the freezing temperatures of the stratosphere.
[
12
]
Due to this, the water cycles completely happens here, with all clouds, from the Stratus to the Cirrus, being in the troposphere.
It is home to some natural disasters, like tornado outbreaks, and hurricanes.
Stratosphere
[
]

The second layer, beginning from the tropopause and ending at 50 km above
Earth
. Here, the higher one goes,
the warmer it gets, as the ozone layer absorbs the Sun's rays.
[
13
]
Here,
many radioactive and dynamic interactions cause processes and circulations occur, dubbed the
Brewer-Dubson circulations
.
Mesosphere
[
]
The mesosphere goes from 60 km to 100 km. Altitudes of the scales of the mesosphere are usually called
"near space"
. This term doesn't have a formal definition, but it usually refers to the region between the
Armstrong limit
, where water boils due atmospheric pressure (18-19 km), and the
Kármán line
, where
astrophysics is used instead of aerodynamics.
Here, alike to an inverted troposphere, temperatures slowly decrease as one goes higher due to CO
2
radiation emissions.
[
14
]
Thermosphere
[
]
Earth's thermosphere, where is the International Space Station, ISS.
The thermosphere is the last atmospheric layer with an accepted boundary, that being from 100 km to around 600 km.
Contrary to the mesosphere, the thin gases in the thermosphere can reach temperatures of 2,500 °C during the day, however, and observer wouldn't experience these temperatures, only coldness.
Just like oceanic tides on the surface, atmospheric tides of larger proportions occur at this level.
Interestingly
, at the edge of the thermosphere, a 10 km thick band of elemental sodium occurs naturally. This band has a very low concentration,
analogous to gas, however
, it is used by scientists to create
guided stars
Exosphere
[
]

This is the last official atmospheric layer of
Earth
, ranging from 600 km to 10,000 km (roughly).
Mercury
and several large moons only contain the
exosphere without any lower atmosphere layers
, referred to as a
surface boundary exosphere.
The upper limit of the exosphere may not have a well-defined limit, it does have a lower limit, the
exobase
. Calculated using a full formula, it is the distance form
Earth
where
barometric functions
no longer apply.
Habitability
[
]
Microbes found on the Moon's samples
Earth
's habitability depends on multiple factors, which
Earth
abides by,
as suggested by the copious amount of life present.
[
15
]
A habitable planet must be located within the goldilocks zone
,
Earth
is located within the first half closest to the Sun, even with strict limits,
Earth
is clearly hospitable.
[
16
]
A life-bearing planet must be made out of a solid substance
, gas planets like
Jupiter
could
theoretically only hold life on their cores
, on which conditions are too extreme for life to form. Thankfully,
Earth
is primarily made out of rock and soil.
A planet with life must have a molten core
, as mentioned above, a molten core gives the planet a magnetosphere, which protects the planet from radioactivity emitted from the
Sun
.
Hospitable planets must be good candidates for an atmosphere
, atmospheres allow for comfortable temperatures for the organisms present and obtains our oxygen.
[
17
]
The chance for a hospitable planet is very low, much less with intelligent life, however, microorganisms can be found as close as the Moon, as they are much more common and durable.

Around 335 million years ago, all of Earth's
continents
were united in a single supermassive one, known as
Pangaea
