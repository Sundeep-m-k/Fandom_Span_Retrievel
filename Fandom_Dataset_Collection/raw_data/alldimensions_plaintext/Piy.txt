Piy is the verse directly containing
The Greatest End-All-Be-All
, also known as the Dumpsterfireverse. It is a simple verse constructed by and known for its loops. The verse in question contains an amount of loops in a linear hierarchy wherein the "loops" are not actually loops, but are instead ever so slightly different to completely alien copies of some previous loop or what preceeds them all. Each subsequent instance is unimaginably larger than the last. Things contained by the loops are usually at the same size they'd be in other loops, or are much smaller / bigger. At the center of Piy is basically just a massive star. You could call them hyperstars or something, that sounds generic but it's sufficient. It hasn't been named yet, but it is so incredibly luminous that about 1/9 of Piy is completely uninhabitable for most lifeforms. It is similar to how in a spiral galaxy the farther out spiral arms are much larger than the inner ones. The immediate successor to Piy in
The Extended Meta Hierarchy
is
Oril
