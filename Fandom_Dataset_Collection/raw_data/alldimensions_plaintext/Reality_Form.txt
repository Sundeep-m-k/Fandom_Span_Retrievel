The
Reality Form
is made up of a bunch of
Distant Realities
that warped into
The Space
and escaped, eventually surrounding The Space entirely. They have no life, because all that life died when The Distant Realities escaped The Space. Most of these realities are quite sizable, the biggest one being over 10000e+10000 googolplex times longer than
The Honeycomb
. Others, however, are only about as small as
Never
.
The temperature also varies between each Distant Reality. When the Distant Realities entered The Space, The
Ultimate SUN
messed up the temperature of some of the realities, causing them to become a scorching wasteland. That also killed many of the lifeforms in there.
It is unknown yet how the Distant Realities warped all the way out of
The Space
.
