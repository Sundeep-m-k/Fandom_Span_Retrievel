The Çirçlé is a round object that acts very diffrently to a normal Sphere. It acts very weird and can do alot of stuff. More information below.
Propertys
[
]
The Çirçlé has a 10 meter radius. This radius can get bigger or smaller, or the Çirçlé can compleatly disaper. Thr radius effects the the roughnes. So if the Çirçlé gets bigger, it gets more rougher. But every nook and cranny that forms when the radius increases, can create holes inside of the Çirçlé that can shoot normal balls. Those balls can stick to anything and will damage the thing its stuck to.
The Çirçlé can multiply if there is empty space. It cant multiply even if there is air, so empty spaces will be full of Çirçlés. But if any Çirçlé touches another Çirçlé, they be flung away at one meter and explode with pure energy. They can be used as infinite energy reactors.
The Çirçlé can randomise its mass, and can change color. The color change can make it have diffrent propertys, like disapering, explodeing, reflecting light, physics change and so much more.
