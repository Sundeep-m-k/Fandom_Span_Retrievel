Inane
(Non-existence, Nothing, etc.) - are actually void
Archrealities
which are filled with 'nothingness.' Unlike
Protoverses
, they exclude all matter and properties expect
Blueprint Particles
and sometimes
·s
for rare occurrences of Inanes. To compensate with the locking mechanic, they're only accessible by subrealities.
Our Inane is used to program really complicated properties and concepts, as it is mostly filled with Property Blueprint Partcles. You may find a short interval of 'Inane' layers after the short interval of Reality layers from
the Novachains
.
Inane is one of the bewilderingly large voids, way larger than even the
Supremums of Zero
because of how null they are. Anything entering the null void is stripped of the very quality of existance rank itself.
