About
[
]
An
Epic NGLVerse
is a type of
verse
containing thousands of
Server Rooms
each.
Verse production
[
]
The combined overheating of Server Rooms produces small deposits of the
Divine Broth
Epic NGL
, which when combined with
Monster power
and the other 19
Divine Broths
allows for mass production, destruction and cloning of all verses in the
Official
Hierarchy
.
As a result, the Epic NGLVerses have usually been the victim of many Type-{y,y,y,y}
civilizations
. However, these deposits are commonly covered under the most unstable portion of these verses, which is the westward region.
West Region and East Region
[
]
The west halves of the Epic NGLverses are very unstable, and it will eject x*y Server Rooms per
voidsecond
. These contain more Server Rooms, so as a result there is more overheating, creating pressurized Epic NGL in the process. These processes are so powerful that the only
entities
that can survive this heat usually are the
Vandalplexes
(which live in these verses) or beings above them.
The East Regions, on the other hand, are unimaginably stable, ejecting 1
Versemulti
per eon. In fact, they're so stable that
strange matter
is impressed by their stability and converts them.
