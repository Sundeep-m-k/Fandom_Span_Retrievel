About
[
]
C.O.Ws
,
COWs
or
Colossal Omnipotent Wonders
are
organisms
similar to a
terrestrial
cow which are composed of roughly 50
black and whites
each. They also can be classified as
sentient
verses
.
Color explanation
[
]
Most Wonders are white with black spots due to the antigravitational white holes and gravitational black holes in them, but there is a 1 in 2000 chance that a brown specimen appears. These exist because of an alteration of their black and whites which turn their antigravitational white holes into alternative versions known as "antigravitational brown holes", which have pretty much the same properties as a white one except their color.
You can also land on the skin of a Wonder, since there's a small barrier outside of their borders which is the reason their contents don't get ejected out of them. Just make sure not to land on white zones, since antigravitational white holes are stronger than the gravitational black holes, so even with the barriers they may affect you.
