The
strange quark
or
s quark
(from its symbol, s) is the third lightest of all
quarks
, a type of
elementary particle
. Strange quarks are found in subatomic particles called
hadrons
. Examples of hadrons containing strange quarks include
kaons
(K), strange D mesons (Ds), Sigma baryons (Σ), and other strange particles.
According to the IUPAP, the symbol
s
is the official name, while "strange" is to be considered only as a mnemonic. The name
sideways
has also been used because the s quark has an I
3
value of 0 while the u ("up") and d ("down") quarks have values of +1/2 and −1/2 respectively.
Along with the
charm quark
, it is part of the second generation of matter. It has an electric charge of -
1
/
3
e and a
bare mass
of 98±6 MeV/c

. Like all
quarks
, the strange quark is an
elementary
fermion
with spin
1
/
2
, and experiences all four fundamental interactions: gravitation, electromagnetism, weak interactions, and strong interactions. The
antiparticle
of the strange quark is the
strange antiquark
(sometimes called antistrange quark or simply antistrange), which differs from it only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.
The strange quark contains a
String
.

The Anti-Strange Quark, Strange Antiquark or just Antistrange is the exact same thing as an Charm Quark, except the charge is negative, so the Anti-Strange Quark just has a charge of +

e.
A strange quark decays into an
Up Quark
and a
W
-
Boson
, which is short lived, and decays into an
electron
and an
Electron antineutrino
. An example of this decay is the decay of a Kaon minus (K
-
) particle. It lives about 10
-8
seconds, which is ridiculously short. When it decays, it forms a π
0
Pion
(This is that particle that decays into an
up quark
). It also creates an
electron
and an
Electron antineutrino
.
