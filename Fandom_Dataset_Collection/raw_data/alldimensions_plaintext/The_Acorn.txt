The
Acorns
are cosmic variants of acorns that are found on the
oak trees
. They're full of
verses
that can support
life
, thus making the Acorn also be full of life.
The insides of the Acorns is also
food
for everything within them. No one knows how the Acorns came into existence or how old they usually are. They just came with their local oak trees.
