About
[

The Meat Cave is a massive, fast growing cave system made of meat. It has a diverse array of lifeforms, and is, hence the name, entirely made of meat. Meat Cave is also alive. It has been mapped many times, but new maps have to be made all the time because it keeps changing. This page is formatted weirdly.
The Entry Point
[
]
the entry point of the meat cave
In the entrance, it's just a hole into a reddish fleshy cave. The image for what it looks like can be viewed below. There is very little life here. Just flesh and some tiny worms called scailworms. These worms are 1-3 centimeters in length and live off of little bugs called scalle beetles, which are much smaller, less than 1 centimeter in length. Those bugs just feed off of moisture. scailworms live for around 16 months, and as babies they are larvae. Dead scailworms are either eaten by scavengers or by scalle beetles that find their moisture and suck it up. another thing about scalle beetles is that they have these funny long appendages at their front that they use to suck water. in the entry point, there are some fleshy spikes at the ceiling, which frequently fall down, sometimes on visitors. Scailworms are not very dangerous, but due to them being carnivores, visitors are still at risk of having parts of their skin being bitten off by hungry scailworms. DOL of a scailworm bite is 5. There is also a large rock that has been overtaken by meat.
Branches
[
]
The entry point branches off into a few paths, these narrow and widen often. The branches can be seen 20 meters into the meat cave. The branches, like the entry point, have spikes on the ceiling, but they also have spikes on the ground. The walls of the branches are breathing, making it more difficult to build anything. The branches still contain scailworms and scalle bugs, but they also contain bronces, which are weird animals that eat scailworms. they look sort of like anteaters and are 30-50 centimeters in length. there are only a few of these in the branches, because the branches aren't very long. There are some more rocks forming in these. Some of the branches lead to dead ends, but most lead to the next section. The branches have a water level of 2 inches in the center.
Flesh Pit
[
]
Flesh Pit is the area after the branches, spanning 50-120 meters into the meat cave. This area has all of the life from before, but is very weird as it is full of spikes and meat rocks. Side spikes can be seen here. The flesh pit also has branches leading out of it. This is the first spot where fungi can be seen growing on the walls. Most of these are poisonous. There's also another pit... inside the pit. It is a 17 meter drop and leads into a pit of spikes. Corpses in the pit will quickly vanish. The flesh pit is also very cold at just 10 degrees fahrenheit, so animals here adapted an extra layer of flesh, and sometimes wear mushrooms to protect themselves from colder areas. A new species can be seen here, which is a scavenger called the floishe. It eats dead bronces and scailworms, and is around the same size as a bronce. Despite the fact that they are only scavengers, they are still dangerous and are slightly more dangerous than a medium sized dog when provoked. Same thing with bronces, except those are weaker. The reason why floce (plural of floishe) are so dangerous is because they are competitive. WIP.
