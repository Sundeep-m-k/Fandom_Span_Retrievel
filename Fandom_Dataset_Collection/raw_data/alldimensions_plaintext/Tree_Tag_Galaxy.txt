The
Tree Tag Galaxy
is an ancient
galaxy
with an estimated age of 13.7 to 15 billion years, rendering it older than JADES-GS-z14-0 by approximately 100 million to 1.4 billion years.
Notable for its distinct tree tag-like structural formation, the galaxy is classified as relatively stable. The galaxy is also notable for having a
wormhole
at its center, unlike most galaxies.
It is classified as a regular spiral galaxy.

History
[
]
It formed 1.2 billion years before the Big Bang of
our Universe
. The galaxy was relatively unstable and as such, there was no
life
. That's until about 13.9 billion years ago. A random highly powered
protoverse
near the Tree Tag Galaxy somehow started attracting it. It got so close that it heated up to extreme temperatures, but a
civilization
that was formed in this galaxy survived the event via using a heat shield.
Just after the Big Bang, the only civilization that developed in this galaxy saw a massive brightness in space - our Universe's birth, its Big Bang. The galaxy flew at an astonishing speed towards it!â€¦ but it was eventually absorbed into the
Universe
and stopped speeding - Its core then was turned from a wormhole to a
black hole
.  The galaxy quasared but it was covered on the upper side - known as a quasi-umbrella event. The beam pointed away from the Universe, almost crashing into the
Milky Way
- flying by it at a distance of 125,000 light years. It passed through the Andromeda Galaxy, making it a temporary ring galaxy. The black hole turned into a wormhole, still having a quasi-umbrella and quasar beam.
It passed through IC 1101 - the wormhole teleporting
stars
, including the one that gave birth to another 2 generations of stars that contained Coatlicue as the descendant.
It crossed the Universe border's (which is thought to be impossible) a billion years ago. It is now in
our
Multiverse
, flying through other universes within it.
