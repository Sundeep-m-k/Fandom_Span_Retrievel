Now there are types of p i t. There is the .t i p Which is p i t., but its 0 Meters long. There is p i t. 2.0 Which isnt infinitly long.But it is indeed very long. It will take you a total of 10 days before you go down. Now there is p i t. 3.0 (yes i am running out of ideas please help me) p i t. 3.0 Is basiclly p i t. 2.0, but longer. It takes 20 days to finish And it goes on and on like that. There even is p i t. 100.0. At p i t. 1000 it would take a total of 10 years to finish. But at the final p i t.,p i t. ω.0(☀10

, it will take over 55.039.890.369.853.656.750.654.457.380.864 days,(55 decillion) or 150.546.746.088.221.161.790.630.353.886,39(150 nonillion) years to finish. But there is actually another p i t.its beyond p i t. ω.0(☀10

. Its called the  .t i p - א‎ωωω.0. it goes on for (☀10

meters. Or in other ways, it would be impossible for a person to go down this p i t. it would take (☀10
