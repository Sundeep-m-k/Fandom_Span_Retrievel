Position

The Tables
Contains:
Wood, graphite, rubber, aluminum, and some awesome paint! Oh yeah, and
Erasers
.
The
Pencils
are very big
structures
located on
Tables
. They can create new
verses
by drawing them on
Papers
. The
Metareality-Webs
are connected to the Pencils. In fact, the eraser on the other end of Pencils are
the Erasers
that keep things from getting outside the Metareality-Webs.
The Pencils also have a few special properties.
The tips can never become dull. They're also sharpened EXTREMELY well.
The eraser at the other end of the Pencils can also never get rubbed away. The rubber that they're made out of is extremely good at erasing. One touch and the graphite is gone in a flash.
The Pencils have many living creatures inside of them directly instead of in a contained verse. One species, the
Woodeaters
, like to eat the wood inside of the Pencils. Other species such as the
Enlectrons
try to keep the Woodeater population down by blasting them with high-energy plasma beams. This usually works, but sometimes it burns through the wood straight to the inner graphite, causing a LOT of problems.

First Layer
[
]
Their first layer is the paint that covers the entire Pencils, except for the graphite tip and the Erasers. This paint protects them from outside threats, such as occasional corrupted verses that can corrupt them and extremely corrosive elements such as
toxicium
. The paint is made up of
Primordium Delta
packed extremely close together, protecting the vulnerable inner layer of wood from getting destroyed. The paint, of course, doesn't protect against the threats inside, such as the Woodeaters.
Second Layer
[
]
The second layer is the wood layer. The wood is quite normal. It is just wood from all over the entire Tables, some from scattered
TREEVERSES
and some is just there for as long as anyone can remember. That wood might've come from the rest of the
Rooms
, the seemingly endless structure that contains the Tables.
Third Layer
[
]
The third layer is the technically not a layer. It is just the graphite stick inside the wood that is creates verses. The graphite is just normal graphite. There's nothing special about it.
Other
[
]
Only entities such as the
Absolute/Primordial
,
THE CREATOR
and above can wield, use and create verses with a Pencil. The Pencil is also a partner of
The Pen
.
