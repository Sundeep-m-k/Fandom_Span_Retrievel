The
Torukuverse
contains the
Torus Chain
and all verses inside it, and it is shaped like a
crosscap
, which allows all objects to mirror themselves if they travel far enough.
It does not have any structure other than containing all of the Torus Chain's verses, and most verses are around
10
150
{\displaystyle 10^{150}}
light-years apart, although an extremely rare occurance is two Torus Chain verses colliding, which can create supergiant Möbistars (upward size of
10
80
{\displaystyle 10^{80}}
light-years).
Surface

The 'surface' of a Torukuverse is actually a whole bunch of very small Torus Chain verses very close together, and it looks like the small Torus Chain verses are resting on a surface, but that's actually a bunch of smaller Torus Chain verses very close together and they're resting on a surface, but that's actually a bunch of smaller Torus Chain verses very close together and they're resting on a surface, but that's actually a bunch of smaller Torus Chain verses very close together and they're resting on a surface, etc.
