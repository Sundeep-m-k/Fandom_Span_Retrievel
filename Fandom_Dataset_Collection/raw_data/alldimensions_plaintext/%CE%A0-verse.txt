The
Π-verse
is a giant universe that is located in the alternate center of the multiverse.
Composition
[
]
It is composed of radioactive clouds of space dust, huge rows of nebulas, and contains a lot of other places. The strange thing in the π-verse is that there isn't any planet at all. There are solar systems, stars, galaxies, but no planets. Instead, there are big balls of cosmic dust.
Life
[
]
In the big balls of cosmic dust biological bacterial beings live in small microscopic eggs, waiting to be hatched. When they grow, they can grow as big as the size of a nebula, floating in the empty void of space. Those creatures cannot escape the π-verse, as it is surrounded by anti-matter, black holes, and dark matter colliding and expanding for eternity.
