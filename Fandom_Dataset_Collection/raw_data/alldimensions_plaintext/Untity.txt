The
untities
are a large civilization that have dominance over their local spiral arm, have achieved status as a Type2.5 civilization, and have a trade relationship with the more primitive
zerities
. Unlike zerities, untities have been united into just 4 factions, but they constantly fight each other. They have no currency, and trade random things instead.

Factions

The Zepton
[
]
The Zeptons is an expansionist faction who wants to become Type 3.0 Civilization. As a result, they started sending out bases to the far away
Local Interstellar Cloud
just a few years ago and hit our stellar neighborhood at Barnard's Star. However, it is estimated they will not reach Earth for another 6561 years at this rate.
The Yocton
[
]
The Yocton is a preservist faction who doesn't want to contaminate the Galaxy. Due to their opposing ideologies, they have conflicts with the Zepton very frequently. In the name of keeping their galaxy clean, this faction tries to cram as many people as possible in just a few planets. Basically, they really like claustrophobia.
The Brimton
[
]
The Brimton is a plutocratic faction who wants to generate trade revenue. They go as far as infiltrating Zeptonian bases to convert them into mining operations.
The Gepton
[
]
The Gepton is a synthetic faction who wants to bioform and gene modify Untities to survive on any planet. They allied with a small research force of
zerities
in order to simulate the bioforming techniques.
