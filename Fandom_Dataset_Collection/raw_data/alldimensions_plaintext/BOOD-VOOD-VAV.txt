BOOD-VOOD-VAV
, or as some call him, "
THE DARKNESS
", is the
Primordialverse's
embodiment of Darkness, it is 1 of the 2 most important gods from
THE 8 DIVINE GODS
, and has thousands of beings known as
Dark Ones
, within its realm, "BOOD VOOD-PRUC HAAT ZLAA-JAC", translating (from
Puffish
) to "THE DARK REALM OF ETERNITY".
Its far opposite brother,
Puffgas
, is despised by it, however Puffgas, with all its purity, wishes not to hate it. The reason for this anger from it, other than them being cardinal opposites, is the fact that Puffgas creates life, a concept BOOD-VOOD-VAV's
EXISTENCE
is against.
It has destroyed countless dimensions and civilizations just based on its will
.
The
Primordial
greatly denounced these actions, and he was so furious, he sealed it forever to its dark home, unable to affect anything within the Primordialverse.
Before it was sealed, it corrupted a few beings within the Primordialverse, and set them out to find a way to release him, ever waiting for his return...
