The Council is the group that decides the fate of every verse and their contents. The Council decides all fate other than that of Ascendent Omni-God, above, and others around their power. Most people in the council have been granted the rank of "Master" or "Grandmaster", but there is a being named "Anakin" who is in this Council but not granted the rank of Master. Councilors have powerful telekinesis powers and swords that can break almost everything to defend against similarly powered beings.

The Senate is often mistaken to be a group. This is wrong, it is a single entity. The Senate is the ultimate force overseeing everything (while beings like
Dunkey Kong
are more powerful, and
Alphasm
creates everything, The Senate keeps the hierarchy from collapsing) and is extremely powerful. The Senate's signature ability is to shoot lightning out of his fingers, instantly killing its enemies. The Senate also has a map of all of existence that he can use to alter things easily. The map that The Senate uses is enchanted to be inable to harm the hierarchy. The Senate also has telekinesis and a sword like The Council. The Senate is easily able to wipe out the council at any time. The Senate owns a large army that can be used to fight off enemies.
