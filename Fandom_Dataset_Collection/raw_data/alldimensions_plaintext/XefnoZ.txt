BestNoobReborn
, and also nerfed XefnoZ to below
Wikiversal
level. Everyone thinked that XefnoZ was dead, but...

Part 5: From the scratch...
[
]
Xefnoz was just a slime in this nerfed form, but he was still way more than universal. He started consuming lots of things, until reaching the Wikiverse again. The 2nd loop entity re-appeared, and a epic fight started. The 2nd loop entity thinked that he was winning, but at the last moment Xefnoz killed him.
He absorbed it.

Martin's attempt to place XefnoZ in a pocket dimension wa my esrol rev ^&&*(*%$%
Part 7: Martin.

...
What do you want? I don't understand.
Oh... I get it now. You want to be THE strongest entity. I offered you a pocket dimension, and you denied it. What more do you want than a place where you can create anything you want and manipulate it to its fullest extent? You can even simulate this Martinverse in the pocket dimensions I can give you.
But... I killed you...
Heh, you really thought you could kill me that easily? I CREATED you, directly or indirectly. Accept it. You won't get this title you want. I'll always be there, keeping it away from you...
Anyways, I'm gonna go.
Remember. I'm always here...
