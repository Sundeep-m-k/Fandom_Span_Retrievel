Big Gamer is a cyber-entity that can do anything in the entire
Hyperverse
, but cannot affect objects beyond cyberspace. He could change cyberspace entirely, but he mainly spends his time making nice video games. Advanced civilizations can connect to the cyberspace to play Big Gamer's video games, and Big Gamer's video games are a huge attraction to other cyber-entities.
Encrypt a message? He knows the encryption/decryption rules and can read your message decrypted without even being connected to the signal. Playing Pacman? He can choose the next level you enter. Texting your bestie? He can choose what message your friend sees, yet he decides to do none of that and just make video games.
It's hard to get in contact with Big Gamer, as he is a cyber entity and doesn't belong to any game, website, etc. However, advanced civilizations and strong gods can manipulate the Hyperverse to be able to contact Big Gamer.
