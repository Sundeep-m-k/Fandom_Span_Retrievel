Structure
[
]
Uqraek fibers are consisted with looped strings, each made of a infinite amount of connecting "Uqraek threads." They never directly occupy spacetime, although they make Uqraek strings to occupy. Each Uqraek fiber is made of exactly
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
Uqraek threads, enough to fill the
Omniverse
.
Uqraek thread is consisted of 3 parts, sorted by steps: B-qraek Primordiums, H-qraek particles, and S-qraek / Source particles.
B-qraek Primordiums
[
]
B-qraek Primordiums come with a connected pair of
Ω particle
and
Σ particle
. It's the first step to build a Uqraek thread.
Ω and Σ particles from different pairs can be connected to form multiple connecting Uqraek threads, but Uqraek threads never branch off because one can connect with at most 2 other B-qraek Primordiums.
H-qraek particles
[
]
H-qraek particles are the particles in which source particles vibrate those for spacetime occupation with their virtual clones, and internal energies. H-qraek particle can be excited to generate external forces by their internal energies.
Each B-qraek Primordium can be connected with H-qraek particle.
There are three types of H-qraek particles.
Protospatial particles
[
]
(See also:
Protospatial particles
)
The particles that can occupy spacetime are called "Protospatial particles," which come with 2 major particles:
Protoverses
for existence and
Nullirotos
for nonexistence, but Nullirotos are always still and neither vibrate nor be excited.
Exotic particles exist for other existence ranks, but some require multiple kinds of Protospatial particles, including all fractional ranks.
If Protospatial particles don't give spacetime occupation, then those virtual particles in spacetime would have null existence ranks.
Connection Primordiums
[
]
Every single connection of Uqraek fiber comes with a pair of Σ particle and Δ particle. They are usefully found at the ends of a Uqraek fiber, although they have opposing positions for each end.
This is where
teraversal-level
substances (like
Glitchonicite
,
Toxicium
, and
Shinoverse
's substance for radiation) are dissolved into S-qraek particles with a lot of Primordium Particles in themselves, even substances at higher levels.
Not all Uqraek fibers have to be linear. At the midst of Uqraek fibers, you will see that one connects with another position, allowing for a more efficient computing for quantum scale, and even higher weights. One particle have equal chance to jump-and-skip or move on to the next position.
If there are at least 3 connections in a row, then the entire Uqraek fiber would be unstable enough to break logic at a quantum scale.
S-qraek particles
[
]
S-qraek particles come with groups for the inputs of the Uqraek fiber code. They vibrate H-qraek particles as they pass through Uqraek threads.
The conditions should be met for S-qraek particles:
It should have at least 3 Primordium particles and nothing else.
One should be either
Σ particle
or
Δ particle
.
Another one should be either
Δ particle
or
Ω particle
.
It shouldn't contain at least 2 Δ particles.
Let's look at all 4 Primordium Particles before beginning the combination table...
A particle
: Positive, lightness, and safe.
Ω particle
: Negative, darkness, and dangerous. But if it comes with A particle, then they can destroy galaxies!
Σ particle
: Balanced, greatness, and self-repairing.
Δ particle
: Increases the power of those particles above.

Trivia
[
]
Uqraek fibers are artifically 1-dimensional, as it makes a single chaotic 1-dimensional object by Microdimensions.
Uqraek fibers only consists of 2 types of particles:
Protospatial particles
and
Primordium Particles
Uqraek Fibers are entirely made of
Blueprint Particles
and
Chaos Fabric
, a Microdimensional fabric for building particles.
As of May 23rd, 2021, this is currently the only object which jumps from Microdimensions to spacetime.
