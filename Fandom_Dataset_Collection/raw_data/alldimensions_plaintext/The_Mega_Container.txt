The Mega Container
Natural Position
Contained by
Everything larger than itself and
the Giga Containers
Contains
The Super Containers
, Antimony Trioxide and a criminal amount of
hyperradioactive Elements
The
Mega Container
is an object that not only contains EVERYTHING smaller than itself, but also is contained by everything larger than itself. This includes everything, so if there are multiple Containers, the objects inside will be contained in all of them at once. As well as this, while there may physically be multiple Mega Containers, there is only one, and it’s just everywhere at once. Like god or something idk
Exiting this is impossibl-er than the
Super Container
. If you somehow do exit, then it will cause a paradox, because which Mega-Container should you exit out of? This paradox will send you to the realm of
Nonexistence
. Get trolled.
This box also contains a criminal (and alarming) amount of
Hyperradioactive Elements
. Good luck surving outside the
Super Container
, you’ll basically get irradiated to dust. The outer edge of the Mega Container is an alloy of Antimony Trioxide (SbO
3
) and an unknown substance that seemingly makes it completely unbreakable, yet you can phase through it (theoretically).
