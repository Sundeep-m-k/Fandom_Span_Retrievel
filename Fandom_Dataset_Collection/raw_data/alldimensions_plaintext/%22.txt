Please!"

Glitchonicite
blasters, and even weapons that glitch you out of reality.

'/", based on eyewitness accounts, seems to be a creature with an extremely long neck and a perfectly spherical head. Its two eye sockets seem to be completely empty, with some black liquid dripping down its face.
'/" also has an extremely long and outstretched smile on its face. It has been seen to be able to open its mouth very wide and swallow creatures whole.
'/" does not have a torso. Its 4 spider-like legs are directly connected to its neck.
