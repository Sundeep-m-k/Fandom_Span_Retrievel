Everything smaller than The Particle
Elementary Hexahedron contains few The Particles and free-floating stuffs inside it. Everything smaller than The Particle and same or bigger than The Box can vibe around this chill (ω hot in average) void inside hexahedron.
But chilling vibe temperature is not the case around hypercluster or The Particle. Their size pushes away existing space (void) of inner elementary hexahedron and hexahedron really hates it. Space compresses around mentioned two objects and it raises temperature to second transinfinite ordinal.
Hypercluster sometimes shatter from unbelievable energy, while one enveloped in The Particle often does not shatter.
⌬ Dimensional collapse
[
]
Occasionally, hypercluster pops from noneexistence to existence inside void. It is not a problem when formed hypercluster is enveloped in The Particle (also not a problem if The Particle slowly disintegrates later), but it is very problematic when formed hypercluster does not have The Particle around it.
Unprotected hypercluster can pop anytime when there is such large amount of energy around it. When it pops, hypercluster explodes with unimaginable force. But that's not the real problem. Perfect void caused by destruction of hypercluster is surrounded by superheated voids.
Those superheated voids now violently expand inward. At the point they all meet at single spot, like 0:56 of

video, expanding voids create extreme wave. The re-expanding wave is so violent, it takes away
all dimensions
(pun originally not intended) of objects it hit.
Only The Particle (which has no dimensions because it is collection of flowing energy) can absorb the shock and protect vast and beautiful realm inside it. Other objects (everything same or bigger than The Box) vibing around inner space of elementary hexahedron is crushed to noneexistence.
(of course, everything repairs after some time)
Hexahedron itself is also not free from hypercluster's OOF. It has at least some mass built out of some weird arrangement of matter and energy duality. The mass immediately disappears, and hexahedron devolves dimensions it had because of mass. dimension of hexahedron drops all the way transinfinitely down to 4D, where there is at least space to contain objects and flow of time.
⌬ Wth is wrong with size
[
]
Yeah, the size is again transinfinitely larger than its lower structure, yet hexahedron contains only few of The Particle. It is because weirdness of
Inner Void
's geometry also applies for Elementary Hexahedron. Near hexahedron's boundary, there is HUGE numerical emptiness region which slowly blurs to set-theoretical emptiness region. More info on that in
Inner Void
page.
The enormous compression of noneexistence constantly and unstoppably interacts with existence enveloped in mathematical emptiness region. Large amount of false existence is made and that false existence is responsible for color of hexahedron. Eventually, mathematical emptiness region is entirely consumed in interactions after trans-eternity later. It is death time of hexahedron, and it shatters from highest dimensional layers until hexahedron ceases to exist.
⌬ Why is it all sparkly
[
]
The reason why the hexahedron sparkles so much, is because parts making up hexahedron (which is countless hypercubes very close to each other, forming gigantic structure called elementary Hexahedron) constantly crumbles away to noneexistence. It does not disappear away calmly, it releases D-radiation in the process. A LOT OF IT.
The D-radiation reflects off from other component cubes. Other cubes are already unstable and POOF, it got tons of D-radiation. Other cubes immediately spit out all of D-radiation while some of cubes cannot take it anymore and just wanna die. It adds new D-radiation to other cubes. This ripple through cubes resonate transinfinitely fast through hexahedron.
Occasional small pink flash is not that significant ripple (blocked because not much cubes have shattered) while the point where entire hexahedron turns into pink is very CHONK explosion.
