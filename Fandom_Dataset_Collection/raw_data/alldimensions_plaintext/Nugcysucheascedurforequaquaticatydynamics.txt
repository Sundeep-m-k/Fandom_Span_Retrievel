Nugcysucheascedurforequaquaticatydynamics is a dynamic connection found only in
The Weird Laughaguaghee
. The second planet in that object is directly linked to it due to Nugcysucheascedurforequaquaticatydynamics. This connection is very strange, but it works because the endless colours in
The Weird Laughaguaghee
combined with the embedded paths create an infinitely strong electromagnetic field that can keep any object in relation to any other. This allows the second planet to remain in contact with
The Weird Laughaguaghee
.

No one has ever replicated Nugcysucheascedurforequaquaticatydynamics before.
The Weird Laughaguaghee
simply has too complex of a mechanism for Nugcysucheascedurforequaquaticatydynamics that replicating it is nearly impossible. However, the expected strategy is to use a nonexistent thing and make it existent, since nonexistent things allow endless possibilities. This nonexistent thing would be a clone of
The Weird Laughaguaghee
