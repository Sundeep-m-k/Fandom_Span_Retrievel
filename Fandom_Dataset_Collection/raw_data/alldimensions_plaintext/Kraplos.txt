Kraplos was created by
Kraa
to serve him. Eventualy, Kraplos separated from Kraa and created his own dimension, once known as “
Krapolnoa
”, now known as The Underworld; and minions.
Googolploxio
saw this and prohibited Kraplos from leaving. He also classified his class as “demons”. Eventually, Kraplos, now known as “Demonicai”, escaped it, but got sent back in. Googolploxio closed him in an unescapable area called
Demonclar
. When Satan arrived at this dimension, Kraplos decided to keep him as a servant to rule the outer Underworld.
