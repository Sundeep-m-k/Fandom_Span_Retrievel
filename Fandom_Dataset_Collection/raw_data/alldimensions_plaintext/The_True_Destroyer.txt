Origin
[
]
The True Destroyer appeared in existence at the same exact time
The True Creator
did. The True Destroyer wasn't aware of its own existence. It floated in the void of absolute nothing. It wasn't aware that it existed until it met
The True Creator
. They met and proceeded to learn how to create and destroy.
The True Creator
would create for The True Destroyer as The True Destroyer destroyed for
The True Creator
to create. Eventually, they created an infinitely small universe containing an infinite amount of energy which would later create a revolutionary event -- The big bang.
The True Creator
decided to create a place for itself and The True Destroyer to live. Eventually,
The True Creator
and The True Destroyer decided to part ways living in their own homes. Of course they kept in contact. A few septillion years later The True Destroyer asked
The True Creator
to create
The Destroyer
as The True Destroyer wouldn't have to do as much work.
