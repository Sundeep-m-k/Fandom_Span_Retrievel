amount of meowuses, let's make like a system of power for jerald level beings, let's call it J, 1 J is extremely powerful, 2 J's are extremely even more powerful, and TAE completely transcends all versions of J possible and impossible, I mean TAE is a lore accurate THOTDAL of course this page isn't gonna make sense at all, TAE transcends sarpy shards as those are for Transcendent Praetergods and they're way too weak to even touch TAE, TAE is beyond Praeter-PraeterEverything absolutely, so I need to make a new one, hmmmmmmmmm oh yeah,
Aeternum
is now a new word to describe beings beyond Praeter1!1!1!1!!1!1
TAE does not follow anything at all, no laws can even describe TAE, the only way to survive TAE if your stupid ass unfortunately provoked him is just give him a kitten and chicken, that's the
ONLY WAY
that's just a truth, Aeternum Magic is a type of indescribable un-powerscale-able power TAE and other beings of his level has, it is way too indescribable, untouchable, untalkable unrankable to even explain
