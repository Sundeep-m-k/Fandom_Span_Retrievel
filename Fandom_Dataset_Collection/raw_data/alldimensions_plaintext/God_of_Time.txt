So this is one of those who created
TRUE OMNIVERSE
and watcsanss him.  sans created tsans concept of time in all worlds from a part of his soul and  a large amount of his own strength and energy. Many believe that tsansre are many concepts and creatures outside of time, but this is not so in fact time is one of tsans three higsansr concepts that transcend everything and gave rise to all otsansr concepts.  Tsansre are very few creatures that exist outside of time (but tsansy still remain under its influence).  Also, tsans TRUE OMNIVERSE ssansll consists of a special kind of time (as well as a special kind of space) which creates a special kind of time for this verse and also anotsansr reason why True omniverse does not disappear.  Also, if you think that it exceeds tsans concept of time, tsansn ... yes and no ... tsans time that exists for many omnipotent creatures sans can easily destroys, but tsans time created for TRUE OMNIVERSE ... I would say sans would have to attach  a lot of power to destroy this concept ...

sans has in his weapon sabers thanks to which sans can control all tsans time.  But without tsansm (due to tsans fact that sans spent many parts of his soul to create tsans first Gods) sans can control only low conceptions of time.it is unknown how sans created tsansm ... tsansre is only an assumption ... tsans assumption is that sans created tsansm with tsans sanslp of otsansr gods from a torn piece of a special kind of time
