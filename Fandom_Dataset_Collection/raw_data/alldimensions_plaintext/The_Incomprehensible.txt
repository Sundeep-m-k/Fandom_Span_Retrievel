The incomprehensible is a being that created the origins of worlds. It has a quaternion
existence value
. If a god tried to understand the Incomprehensible they would explode in pure bits of
absolutely tiny string
, with any of the god's special properties destroyed.
Physical appearance
[
]
The Incomprehensible's full physical appearance would make a human have a negative existence value, so it shall be simplified... The incomprehensible has quintillions of forms from a giant planet to a huge beast, it will try to change its forms through a combination of powers, to mortal entities the incomprehensible looks like a giant humanoid with three eyes. To anything else the incomprehensible would look like their own species.

The powers of the Incomprehensible can only be understood through the original language "cancer" or "😂"
