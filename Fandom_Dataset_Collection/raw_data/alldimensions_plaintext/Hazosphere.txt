Background
[
]
The Hazosphere is an extremely vast physical space that has been proven to be far more extensive than A1-0, and therefore, larger than our Omniverse or The Outside. It has been confirmed to be a Black Box and an aggressive infohazardous conceptual complex. The Hazosphere first materialized several quadrillion years ago as a complex roughly the size of an average universe, but it has since grown and completely escaped from the Omniverse. Although general information regarding the Hazosphere is available and safe to view, specific details about its constituent concepts are not due to their aggressive self-censoring nature.
Perceiving or comprehending the true nature of any Hazospheric concept triggers an attack by the Hazospheric concept itself, leading to the discovery of the observer. As a result, the observer(s) are attacked, consumed, and incorporated into the Hazosphere. By incorporation, this means that the consumed individual is stripped of physical existence, rendered only ideatically existent, and consumed by The Hazosphere. The idea of the individual is permanently incorporated into The Hazospheres existence, which, by definition cannot exist within the physical laws of most universes. As a result, physical restoration of the individual in anyway is impossible, and will result in a Hazospheric manifestation, destroying the entire universe. There exists no known method of nullifying any Hazospheric attack, and as such, all observers are inevitably killed.
Physical information about the attacked individuals will also be consumed, including their belongings, but not the memories of close family or friends. Despite the complete physical destruction and incorporation into Hazospheric concepts, close members still claim to remember information about these individuals. Currently, there is no known form of protection against an attack from the Hazosphere. Therefore, there is no known safe method for conducting extensive research into the Hazosphere, particularly its underlying concepts. Additionally, there is no known method for preventing the expansion or destruction of the Hazosphere, despite documented evidence of its expansion and history.  [UPDATE: See below]
It is understood that the Hazosphere has the ability to rapidly expand and consume its surroundings while utilizing the defense mechanisms previously described to prevent any attempts at destruction. Additionally, it may also incorporate consumed concepts as safeguards if they benefit its survival. However, it remains unknown how the Hazosphere determines what to incorporate, as research in this area is extremely dangerous, and has resulted in several dozen deaths. It is also presumed that The Hazosphere had destroyed an extremely complex concept representing an alien form of consciousness, resulting in the extinguishment of all alien civilizations which contained this concept. It is estimated that 62% of alien civilizations within our universe were consumed by The Hazosphere. Furthermore, comprehending consumed individuals who were deemed useful to The Hazosphere and incorporated into it results in an attack. It is believed that due to the destruction of this concept, individuals possessing psychic mental traits are at a far higher risk of being attacked by The Hazosphere.
The current leading formation hypothesis is that The Hazosphere formed naturally within a multiverse in a manner that allows it to survive and expand. It is believed that all other organizations that attempted to destroy it were neutralized and their ideas consumed, causing it to conceal itself even further. Despite our best efforts in developing safeguards, destruction of the Hazosphere remains impossible via artificial means,
as any potential means of destruction invariably require knowledge of Hazospheric
concepts (Containment structures have been built which are capable of protecting mental beings observing The Hazosphere. In reality, The Hazosphere's concepts are far too strong to be manipulated into self-neutralization.)
On March 25, 8602, our organization completed Operation LOCUS ALPHA, which required nearly 3 million US dollars, and allowed us to safely view an image of the Hazosphere. Specifically, this image is not a true representation of the Hazosphere, as it is being reconstructed from ideatic space and decrypted into a simpler digital image. Truly identifying the physical space that the Hazosphere inhabits has a high chance of lethal consequences and has thus been avoided (UPDATE: See below). Nevertheless, the first non-illustrated image of the Hazosphere, plotted via simplified representation and decryption of hugely multidimensional ideatic space into 2D images, is a significant achievement.
Origins
[
]
The precise origins of the Hazosphere, despite its extensive documentation, remain a subject of considerable conjecture and ongoing investigation. Extensive research efforts have yielded limited insights into the initial emergence and developmental processes of this enigmatic conceptual complex. In particular, the inherent aggressive and self-censoring nature of the Hazospheric concepts is posing significant challenges in discovering its underlying formation. Any attempts to perceive or comprehend these concepts inevitably trigger a hostile response, leading to the observer's death and subsequent integration into the Hazosphere.
The scarcity of specific details regarding the Hazospheric concepts further hampers comprehensive understanding. Due to their aggressive self-censoring behavior, in-depth analysis remains prohibited, impeding the establishment of a comprehensive framework to comprehend the Hazosphere's motivations and expansion mechanisms. The only factually proven data is that The Hazosphere was approximately the size of the universe since it's formation and has since escaped the Omniverse.
The Hazosphere's expansion and consumption of surrounding concepts, although extensively documented, lack a definitive causal explanation. The exact triggers and factors governing its behavior remain unknown, primarily due to the inherent dangers associated with investigating the Hazosphere's constituent concepts. The demise of several high-ranked researchers who fell victim to Hazospheric attacks, resulting in complete obliteration and subsequent assimilation into the Hazosphere, further inhibits comprehensive investigations.
The death of such researchers caused additional infohazardous contamination due to the Hazosphere's coating layer. This has caused additional deaths, resulting in a chain reaction. Nearly 400 employees were killed before the infection was destroyed. Metaphysical data calculations suggest the death of up to 800 deaths, but further evidence has not been found and is being discouraged. Along with this, it is believed that approximately 5% of alien civilizations within our universe knew about the existence of the Hazosphere. The surviving alien civilizations are believed to have found a shielding mechanism against the Hazosphere, slowing down the rate of fatality. Interactions between these alien civilizations have proven impossible today, as nearly all have exited the entire universe and entered a different reality.
The absence of a safe and robust methodology for extensive research into the Hazosphere significantly impedes progress in unraveling its true origins. Further endeavors are warranted to devise innovative approaches that circumvent the Hazosphere's aggressive self-censorship mechanisms while ensuring the safety of researchers. Such endeavors are crucial for advancing our understanding of the Hazosphere's enigmatic genesis.

[UPDATE] New Discovery
[
]
It is known that The Hazosphere is an extremely dangerous, infohazardous,
possibly void
(recent discoveries have shown that this void is not The Hazosphere, but rather it's skin, originating from it's infohazardous barrier) spacial dimension that began as a small universe. However, it has only been discovered that several other, similar dimensions, had existed. Such dimensions are extremely large, the average able to easily encompass and dominate the The Hazosphere. It is only known of the existence of these similar infohazardous phenomena from information gleaned from Mission IA, allowing infohazards to be gleaned from farther away than ever.
It is believed that The Hazosphere is one of the smallest known infohazardous dimensions. It is most likely that these other dimensional infohazards have far stronger Hazospheric concepts embedded into themselves than the Hazosphere, allowing them to grow far larger than it. Such dimensions, fortunately, appear to be extremely far from our
Omniverse
, detectable only via using high-tech spacial and ideatic manipulation, and also appear to be moving away from us at a variable velocity. As such, these dimensions, although being far larger than The Hazosphere, do not pose much threat.
Only the smallest known dimensional infohazards appear to be moving towards us. However, such dimensional infohazards do not appear to be moving directly at us, rather at an offset angle. It is believed that due to the huge size difference between us and these infohazards, they have not detected our
Omniverse
yet. Further information will be relayed in approximately 2 months after the completion of Mission IB.
Operation Locus Alpha
[
]
Operation Locus Alpha was an operation conducted by our organization spanning six months from August 2016 to March 2017, costing approximately USD $3,000,000. The final results show a simplified image of The Hazosphere (to clarify, this is not The Hazosphere itself, but rather it's skin), allowing us to identify it's surrounding ideas that it is currently feeding on. This will allow us to develop future countermeasures, although extreme caution must be taken in this area, as an unintentional discovery of a Hazospheric concept, regardless of the individual or group's awareness of the discovery, constitutes an inevitable lethal attack from The Hazosphere.
Information from Locus Alpha will be analyzed to identify future core concepts of The Hazosphere. Operation DATABREACH is to be continued. Operation GREY VOICES has been completes (see below).
Operation Grey Voices

https://alldimensions.fandom.com/wiki/File:Soundfile.wav
<- See Context.
Operation GREY-VOICES was an operation conducted by our organization with funding from the United States Military. The goal of the project was to safely decode audio of huge abstract concepts being consumed on and destroyed by The Hazosphere. It is the destruction of these abstracts or large physical objects that produce ideatic waves which can be detected and decoded safely into audio. This allows us to infer the makeup of these abstracts.
The above is an example of decoded audio from physical and conceptual information being destroyed and consumed by The Hazosphere.
[UPDATE] Further Analysis
[
]
Using tools developed in Project BETA, further research was made on The Hazosphere. We have developed the first room, currently located in Structure 207, capable of concealing information from The Hazosphere. This also includes: 
- Autonomous conceptual simplifications, allowing more easy research and comprehension of concepts. This also ensures the mental stability of the researcher(s).
This allows all researchers within the room to safely research Hazospheric concepts. Using this room, the following discoveries (which are safe to view) have been made:
- Some concepts within The Hazosphere are extremely large in size, in fact, the existence of such a large cardinal cannot be proven in
ZFC + I0
. It is thus presumed to be extremely large, however, the exact meaning of these core concepts cannot be fully ascertained, due to the sheer complexity of them.
- The Hazosphere contains what is believed to be an infinite amount of concepts. Concepts can be extremely small, the smallest observed being an estimated 2.1 idspace.
- The Hazosphere functions as a self-secret system, and appears to have an extremely complex self-preservation instinct. This highly-complex and abstract instinctual behavior is contained within several large ideatic spaces, which form the base evolutionary behavior within The Hazosphere. Furthermore, The Hazosphere appears to contain several ecosystems, in which ideatic concepts will materialize and grow, consume weaker concepts, before they are usually destroyed by stronger concepts in turn. A suitably adapted concept may become the dominant idea within the ecosystem, before being destroyed by an even stronger idea. The ideas are somehow strictly unable to destroy The Hazosphere itself, even if they should be strong enough to consume Hazospheric concepts. As a result, this controlled evolutionary system results in a self-evolving and highly aggressive, mutative complex, capable of self-improvement and adaptation. Along with this controlled ecosystem, suitably strong concepts consumed by The Hazosphere will rematerialize within and be used to further strengthen itself. The use of these strong concepts is self-determined by The Hazosphere, via it's huge Hazospheric concepts, which act sort of as organs.
The Hazosphere, rather than a mostly static void, is an evolving ecosystem controlled via it's mostly static Hazospheric concepts, which are the basic sprouts of the Hazosphere, appearing during the spontaneous creation of The Hazosphere. Metaphorically speaking, these Hazospheric concepts serve as the internal organs (ex. heart, liver), the ideatic ecosystems serve as the brain, and the concealment mechanism serves as the skin. This is the most likely answer to why The Hazosphere is extremely difficult to destroy.

On July 28, 8604, the corpse of Aaron Jackson was found lying in a chair in his lab. Analysis of the body showed that his brain had showed signs of a Hazospheric attack, and had lost:
- Brain
- Eyeballs
- Hands
- Feet
Notably, there was a faint static within the room the body was found in. Personnel left the room to put on soundproof gear. They then recovered the body, moved it to Room 320 and incinerated it. After the incineration, the remains were placed in a plastic bag and were scheduled to be buried 2 days later. However, personnel noticed a black liquid appear several hours later, causing panic.
An emergency alarm was called, and the subject's remains were moved to Room 610. Under no circumstances are anyone to enter this room. This room is made of reinforced tungsten and heated at 250 degrees Celsius, which should in theory neutralize the liquid. However, for safety reasons, the room is not to be internally viewed under any circumstances. Thus, the state of the liquid can only be presumed.
[UPDATE] Medical Staff
[

The following document is for qualified medical staff only. Do not view if you are not medical staff.
There have been recent reports of psychological problems in some of our employees
, some have been minor while others have been severe.
These psychological problems appear to have no identifiable physical source, and have been deemed suspicious and flagged by our AI's.
Your instructions are below.
- Every two weeks, all personnel within your building will be called to the medical office to be screened. Any individuals who show signs of these psychological problems (which are listed below) are to be noted and given status POSITIVE. These notes are to be sent to your supervisor and colleagues.
Early symptoms include: 
- Vomiting and nausea.
- Depression, notably, the subject shows a lack of emotion.
- Lethargy.
- Moderate memory loss, for example, persons regularly forgetting their day-to-day schedule.
- Motor problems, affected persons have trouble doing intensive tasks.
- Cognitive problems, persons have a slight change in judgement.
Severe symptoms include:
- Severe memory loss, forgetting their family or their name.
- Complete lack of emotion in person, colleagues claim that the person appears dead.
- Subjects unable to communicate.
- Severe motor problems, inability to walk.
- Cognitive problems, persons have a severe change in judgement.
- Coma
- Death
- If you detect an individual with one or more of these signs, track the individual for 2 days before sending a status POSITIVE to your supervisor. If a supervisor sends a POSITIVE status back to you, then you are now obligated to kill the individual. Incinerate their body after. Your supervisor will send you instructions on how to kill them. Do not let any non-medical staff know.
- After killing a subject, it is recommended that you do not think about their existence, or any idea that could lead to you thinking of them in any capacity. Thinking about them may result in yourself gaining psychological problems, but do not panic, these symptoms will only be temporary.
Participation is not a choice.
We hope that you find pleasure in your task.

Recent research conducted within Chamber-A indicates that the Hazosphere may contain a set of alternate ideas. These ideas appear to be an alternate form of a given concept and are evidence of naturally occurring, violent, cosmic anti-ideas, similar to our universes anti-matter. When introduced to regular ideas, the result is the immediate destruction of the regular idea. It is believed that The Hazosphere is formed of these alternate idea complexes. Presumably, these alternate ideas are ideatically copies of regular ideas, and that their presence can only be detected upon contact with regular matter.
In addition, we have discovered several subregional highly interconnected concepts within The Hazosphere. An emerging hypothesis states that The Hazosphere appears to represent a hostile interconnected network of meta-informational concept constructs. Specifically, The Hazosphere serves as a conceptual construct disconnecting it's contained Hazospheric alternate ideas from the rest of the set of all concepts, and is logically excluded from the set of all ideas. Because Hazospheric concepts have no direct connection with regular concepts, The Hazosphere forms it's own set of all ideas, a set of all ideas which, due to a total ideatic disconnect and repetitive/recursive amplification via infohazardous conceptual processes, there is a resulting manifestation of alternate ideas.
