The
Clockworks
are giant objects where multiple systems of reality react with each other. Each system is within a gear of the Clockwork. Due to the fact that size varies between the different realities, the Clockworks' size have to be described in ULTRAMETERS. They're so large that each of their infinite gears hold multiple
Existencies
on them, and they're too small to make the cogs affected at any level. And there are infinite cogs within a Clockwork.
The Clockworks have gravity, so the gears within them roll around based on the distribution of weight. This allows the Clockworks to work properly.
The Clockworks have an indescribable amount of states. Here are a few notable ones:

Blue
[
]
The Clockworks turn blue whenever at least 10 wheels go at least 1 degree per Planck time. This is a very rare event. If the Clockworks turn blue, then whole verses will get destroyed from the blue light, leaving only 99.999999999999% of the verses in their local Clockwork.
Red
[
]
The Clockworks turn red whenever at least 2 wheels go at least 10 degrees per Planck time. This is even rarer than the Clockworks turning blue. The red light doesn't destroy verses, but rather, carries verses millions of miles away.
Green
[
]
The Clockworks turn green almost always whenever the conditions for being blue and red are satisfied. This is when it will create verses. To make up for the rarity of this event, it creates verses that are 1% of its current selves per Planck time, leading to intense growth.
Glitchy

If somehow the blue and red states are satisfied, but the Clockwork isn't green, then instead, it becomes a quantum mess. Particles change into other particles randomly in 0.1% of verses, and in 1% of verses, particles will become quantum entangled.
