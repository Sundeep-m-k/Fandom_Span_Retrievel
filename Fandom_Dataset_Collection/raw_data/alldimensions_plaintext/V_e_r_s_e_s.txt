The
V e r s e
hierarchy
is a very strange one that is located beyond the
Bims
. It is a complete repeat of the hierarchy all the way from
Universes
to Bins, but much larger. These names are spaced out, so an Universe would be called U n i v e r s e, Multiverses would be called M u l t i v e r s e s, etc. all the way up to the B i n s.

Description
U n i v e r s e
"The U n i v e r s e s are protective shells
around nearly everything in this
wiki
, and everything
not
in this wiki too
. They contain Bins, which means tyey're seriously large and incomprehensible."
M u l t i v e r s e
"These contain U n i v e r s e s. Is this even reality anymore? They're so large..."
M e t a v e r s e
"W h y"
X e n o v e r s e
"A
Xenoverse
variant, but they literally never stop getting larger. SO LARGE OMGGGGGG"
H y p e r v e r s e
"Lol no u"
O m n i v e r s e
"At last. Like the normal
Omniverses
, but at an infinity TO THE INFITITY LIKE INFINITY TIMES scale. The common ones thus seem like nothing now."
T h e O u t s i d e
"Areas that surrounds the O m n i v e r s e s. We are getting some serious deja vu here."
T h e B a r r e l
"I wonder why
they
're called "Barrels". Im pretty sure the real things don't even actually look like barrels."
B a r r e l p l e x
"They contains B a r r e l s. Sometimes, past experiences can help you learn."
T h e B o x
"Welp. It has been a long journey. We started with simply an Universe. But it went up.
Boxes
were initially thought to be the largest things on the wiki, but
people
improved. They were able to create larger things. Really, there was never an end after all. There was never, ever an actual end to this journey of trying to get the highest infinity."
C e t a v e r s e
"Told you. Ends never happen. It even goes to miner's weird chain!"
M a n d e l b r o t v e r s e
"Still going. You know, it would be weird if we copied the entire wiki at this point. Maybe worth a try, xD"
M e g a - B o x
"Purple box."
U l t r a - B o x
"I love how we aren't being original at all anymore."
T h e G r e a t T r i a n g l e
"They have three sides. What the heck are we even doing?"
T h e G r e a t S q u a r e
"They have four sides. Why are we even making this? We know what conclusion we will come to."
T h e S u p e r S p a c e
"Why did the monkey cross the road?"
T h e A b s o l u t e S p a c e
"Once I fell asleep on an airplane, and after I woke up I puked, I guess its motion sickness, but IDK"
T h e N e a r E v e r y t h i n g
"The weird thing is that the Near Everythings contain nothing. Life is strange."
B n a t h v e r s e
"Remove the n and its a bath. Scrubbin in the tub, rub a dub dub."
U b e r R e a l m
"Isn't uber a car brand?"
T h e E n d
"Why are we being so serious about a made up wikipedia?"
E v e r y v e r s e
"Does squaring infinity really make a difference?"
T h e C o i n
"I think paper straws are the worst inventions ever."
T h e B i n
"Yes. Finally."
