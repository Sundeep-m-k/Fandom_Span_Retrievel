The Dimensional Metareality Reboot Lab (or TDMRL) is a large location meant to produce devices which can reverse time  and glitchiness in large verses. TDMRL produces trillions of these robots daily, with production going up further as larger parts of Alphasm's imagination are discovered. These little robots, when together, can change the time and glitchiness of realities around it infinitely far, up to about a small superverse away from themselves. Larger gatherings exponentiate their affects.
