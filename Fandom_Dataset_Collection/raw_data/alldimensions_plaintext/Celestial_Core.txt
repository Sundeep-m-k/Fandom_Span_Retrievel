A Celestial Core is an object created when a Universe collapses into an object of an incredibly large size, and a Universe forms around it.
Properties
[
]
The Celestial Core has a unique gravitational pull that pulls everything near it, instead of into it. This causes a Universe to form around it, a Universe which, unlike other Universes, slows expansion instead of quickening it.
If you manage to beat the intense heat and pressure of the Core, it can be mined for materials.
