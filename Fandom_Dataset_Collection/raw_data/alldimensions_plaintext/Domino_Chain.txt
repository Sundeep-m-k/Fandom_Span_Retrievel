The 🁽verse, one of the verses in the Domino Chain.
The
Domino Chain
is a short chain of special
verses
resembling simplified representations of dominoes. There are 49 verses in the chain, and each of them has a name based on the respective domino. Each verse's size is (top domino number)^^2 + (bottom domino number) ly: E.g: the 🁽verse is 3^3 + 5 = 9+5 = 14 ly.
Every verse in the Domino chain contains the previous verse, regardless of either's size. For example, the 🁪verse is somehow able to contain the 🁩verse, despite the 🁪verse (1^1 + 0 = 1 ly) being smaller than the 🁩verse (0^0 + 6 = 7 ly).
