Complex
[
]
Infinity is already complex enough but thinking what is after infinity is Complex but Complex is bigger than
infinity
(10^Complex) = (10^Infinity^1000)
DISCLAIMER:These are just made up so don't think it's weird if it doesn't show up on google
Complexical
[
]
Complexical is much bigger than complex it is much bigger than infinity it is so complex that its bigger than infinity (10^Complexical) = (10^Complex^1000)
Omega
[
]
Omega is bigger than Complexical Omega is so big that it's bigger than Infinity (10^Omega) = (10^Complexical^1000)
Beyond Complexical
[
]
Beyond Complexical is much much bigger than Omega it is 1 trillion times the size of Omega (10^BC) = (10^Omega^1,000,000,000,000)
Super Infinity
[
]
Super Infinity The Meaning "Super" is like Giga or Mega. Super infinity is Like Mega Infinity and its like this (10^SI) = (10^BC^Googol)
Hyfinity
[
]
Hyfinity means Hyper Infinity Hyper is Bigger than Omega or Omni It is pretty big and its like this (10^Hyfinity) = (10^SI^Unkown)
Infinityplex
[
]
Infinityplex is like Infinity + Complex Like Googolplex Googol + Complex This Number is Super Big. Its as big as The Void Infinite (10^Infinityplex) = (10^Hyfinity^Complex)
Absolute Infinity
[
]
The Term "Absolute' means Ultimate or Maximum Absolute Infinity is very big this rank is very Unobservable and goes like this (10^AI) = (10^Infinityplex^BC)
Far Beyond Infinityplex
[
]
This is bigger than Absolute Infinity because Far Beyond Infinityplex is as long as heck that goes like this (10^FBI) = (10^Infinityplex^SI)
