The Absolute Core is the absolute form of the
core
. As it contains every type of cores, it no longer being a core itself. It has all types of information and energy, more than just being possible, impossible and imaginary. Due to this, an absolute core has the widest area of being infleuntial. This makes it even more powerful than
