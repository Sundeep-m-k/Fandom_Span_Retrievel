The
Galliumverse
is a
Verse
made out of gallium.
It has 3 seperate regions. Those regions are the outer zone, the planetary zone, and the black zone.

Regions

Outer Zone
[
]
The outer zone is like our regular
Universe
. It persists for 1% of the universe. It transitions into the Planetary zone, as
Planet
s become more crowded, and they are increasingly made of Gallium.
Planetary Zone
[
]
The planetary zone is a zone made characteristic by it's solar systems and Gallium stars. Habitable  planets are here, and there is life. It takes up 98% of the universe. Let's explain what Gallium stars are.
Gallium stars
[
]
Gallium stars are not just made out of gallium. They are also made up of uranium at the center. The gallium is a liquid, as the temperature is higher than 27°. The uranium acts as a fire-starter. The size of the star can range from anywhere between 50 km and 5 LY. It can't be too big otherwise they lose their electrons, and it becomes a chain reaction. On the outside, it looks like a silvery liquid ball.
Black Zone
[
]
The black zone is the very center of the Galliumverse. It has a
Black hole
at the center, stretching for a giggol light-years. It sucks anything within 10^^^100 light-years, so don't even go to the black-zone. You will not find very many planets, as they are usually sucked by the black hole. Inside the black hole, it is unknown.
Laws of physics
[
]
The 5 laws of physics are located right here.
The first law of psychics is that every extremely massive object (Luna+) has to be made of at least 95% gallium.
The second law of physics is that normally massive objects (Ceres-Luna) Have to be made of mostly gallium.
The third law of physics is that the border acts like gallium, it takes a few minutes to get to by human temperature, but at higher temperatures, it can be passed in 1 minute.
The fourth law of physics is that in the Black region, time slows down extremely, to 1 second per 10^10^100 years. This allows the Galliumverse to exist a extremely long time, as the blackhole in the center will not collapse for at least 10^^100.0001 years.
The last law of physics is that one in G(1) black holes lead to this black hole, meaning material can be spewed into the galliumverse via black holes.
Materials
[

Non-Metals
[
]
Latite (Lt)
[
]
Latite is a pink-ish gas that acts like oxygen. It has 5 electrons in it's valence shell, so it can take 3 electrons from other elements. It is in the same group as Nitrogen. It can form Latite Trihydride, which is a mercury-like liquid. It can also form Latite Oxygen Hydride, which has the formula of HLtO.
Coolium
[
]
Coolium is a liquid element. It has the property of cooling objects below Absolute Zero. It is used in super-coolers, which take something and cool it to -1000K or less. It looks purple. It is in the same group as Neon.
Metals
[

Tankite
[
]
Tankite are made of rolled homogeneous armor is a greenish-brown material that is hard. It is also bouncy, which allows for armor. It can form 2 bonds. Unluckily, it reacts halfly with Latite every 50 years, so new armor has to be made. You can make alloys out of it.
Types of Planets
[
]
Gallic
[
]
The Gallic planets are 99.99... With 99 9's gallium. It is extremely hard to find a non-gallium atom on them. They are liquid though as core pressure and heat make it so it is hotter than the melting point.
Terrestrial
[
]
Terrestrial planets have a grassy, rocky, and watery exterior, but in the inside they are gallium, as everything bigger than the moon must be 95% gallium. That is why the other matter is only the crust. Life can exist on here, and a documented civilization Iives here.

Tankians
[
]
Tankians are rolled homogeneous armor metal cubes, with turrets at the front and back. They have eyes at their right and left, like countryballs. They rank a 3.57 on the KS, and they colonized 3 galaxies.
Technology
[
]
The technology of the Tankians are the super-cooler, the antimatter engine, antimatter lasers, better spaceships, and much more. The antimatter engine uses the antimatter and matter destruction to power itself. It can only be made with Psudeomatter, as that doesn't react with normal and antimatter. You can make antimatter by smashing 2 proton/electron together.
Superstructures
[
]
The Tankians have made a superstructure around their universe. It is the Universal cooler, and it's function is to stop the entire border from melting, as if the border melted, it would cause havoc on the solar systems and galaxies in it.
