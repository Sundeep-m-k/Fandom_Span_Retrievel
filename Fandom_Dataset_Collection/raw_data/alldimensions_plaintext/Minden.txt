Structure
[
]
Minden's dimensionality and diameter are derived from the constant
֍
. It can only be conceptualized by Jerald, the
Omnicreator
(creator of Minden), and succeeding authorities. It is split into three parts: the Voids, the
Mindenspheres
, and the Mindenwebs.
The Voids
[
]
The Voids are chunks of Minden without Mindenspheres; its material is corrupted. Entering entities will be ripped into internal material that is deposited throughout Minden.
Mindenspheres
[
]
Mindenspheres are unique verses of similar scale to the
Allsphere
. Mindenspheres contain
Veraverses
, a counterpart of the
The Giftbox
of the Mindensphere.
Mindenwebs
[
]
The Mindenwebs are large web-like structures that contain the Mindenspheres. This is the main structure of Minden. The Mindenwebs are extremely strong, being the most powerful thing in our Aspeiros.
Background
[
]
Minden was created when the Omnicreator, an entity part of Omnids(all-powerful civilization) had the idea of creating Minden. When the Omnicreator created it, it caused a huge explosion to happen, which hurt the Omnicreator(yes, an all powerful God got hurt by an explosion) which caused his Omnid Blood to spill into Minden, creating the Mindenwebs.
Mindensphere creation
[
]
Mindenspheres had been created by the Mindenwebs when the leftover blood had formed into small sphere-like structures. This caused Mindenspheres to form, and unbeknownst to the Omnicreator(who frankly didn't care much about Minden before this) had caused these Mindenspheres to form smaller structures, and them to create smaller structures, etc.
Allsphere creation
[
]
Something strange happened though - a Mindensphere, that had no leftover Omnid blood to make smaller structures - had become so small that it would be like comparing an atom to the Omniverse. This caused it to rip apart and explode, causing the leftover matter to form into a very strange Mindensphere - so much to the point where it was no longer considered a Mindensphere. The Omnicreator saw this happen, and so he named the "glitched sphere" the Allsphere.
