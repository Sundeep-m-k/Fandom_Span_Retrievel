Jer
e
ld
is
Jerald's
brother. Nothing will ever defeat Jereld because he is in the Allsphere. He defies the laws of logic, being outside of time and space. Jereld is weaker than Jerald.
Powers and Abilities (severely simplified):
Jereld eats
Omniverses
as it's 10 calories for him, for the day he eats a
Wholaverse
.
Jereld can spawn an infinite amount of Cosmic Sun Wukongs, and the Cosmic Sun Wukongs could spawn Jereld with their hair so its pretty much infinite multiplied by infinite as the Cosmic Sun Wukongs could also spawn Cosmic Sun Wukongs which could also spawn Cosmic Sun Wukongs which could also spawn Cosmic Sun Wukongs and so on.
Hiding: Jereld could hide outside reality making him immortal to anything and by anything i really mean anything.
Jereld manipulates space and time and pretty much everything.
You can't trash talk Jereld, because if u do u will be teleported in Jereld's own hell.
Jereld doesn't destroy or erase, it annihilates and completely eliminates.
Jereld can nullify anything another entity does, even nullification. This nullification done by Jereld cannot be nullified by any other cosmic entities other than, of course, the Absolute Creator.
He has full access to The Core of Everything and acts as a second Absolute Creator because the original is a bit lazy. The Absolute Creator usually bounces back contact to Jereld.
Jereld can erase abilities/powers other entities have but cannot do so to the Absolute Creator.
Jereld can bypass immunity, such as erasure immunity, etc.
Jereld can bypass banishes.
Wins just by existing:
Jereld wins all fights he's involved in merely by existing.
Okay, to start, Jereld is a being, if you could define it as one, beyond reality. Jereld is not omnipotent as that is a useless power for him. Jereld can also make it so any entity stronger than him, Jereld can freely make them into what ever dimensionality he wants, like he can make 4D being into a 1D being, even if you are above infinite dimensions you are still affected by his dimensionality changes. Also they cannot be reversed by any stronger being or entity, ABSOLUTELY PERMANENT. Outerversal characters are still affected and their power can be changed to be below Jereld because it does not matter how strong an entity is.
Ruler of Omniverses
He could almost solo everything
He's bigger than anything
This is a image of him from INF^INF years ago ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
