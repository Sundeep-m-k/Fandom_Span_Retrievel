Hardcore Axion
Strangely, the Hardcore Axions look more similar to an
illuminate
than to an actual
Axion

The
Hardcore Axion
are verses identical to the
Axions
, and also are made out of them. As the name suggests they're
hardcore
axions in a way that is very literal, since the axions that make them become harder and harder to tpurroc-inta using
Anticite
.

Dangers of the Hardcore Axions
[

Absorption
[
]
Strangely (but obviously), since common sense and logic was thrown out of the window about 3 million articles ago, they're both an entity and a verse, and anything that enters this entity-verse (outside of the
Fields
) will slowly become part of the verse's mass, and the further you travel into them, the faster you disintegrate.
Infection
[
]
Those who have escaped have not lived for long outside it, since usually, if any victims escape this verse, they get infected with a non-infectious disease that, just like the verse itself, will slowly degrade the person's physical and mental health until their body fully degrades. The degraded body, immediately after the victim's breathing has stopped, the body seems to simply vanish from sight, and the presumed reason for this is because the verse pulls the victim back in, and still gains their mass (not much compared to the full size of the verse.). Here are the states of the victim's body when infected:
Infection stages
[
]
Stage 1
[
]
The victim does not seem to have any serious physical or mental issues, except for a tiny, blue and black spot, usually on the face/cheek. When being looked at by any other person other than the affected person, it will morph into the shape of a birthmark or natural occurence, such as freckles.
Stage 2
[
]
Remember when I said it was NON-infectious? Well... that was the first stage. The victim starts having a lot more spots, and becomes greatly sick. Don't get close to the victim in this stage, it could infect you, except if you are an greatly powerfull being.
Stage 3
[
]
The victim starts having an very aggressive behavior, and starts attacking other entities. The best way to be safe of a stage 3 infected entity is to contain it somehow (best method is using aluminum foil wrap. Yes, it is THAT easy).
Stage 4
[
]
The victim has so many spots that looks like a blue-black monster, and has an behavior very similar to a zombie. It gets a lot more aggresive, but containing it still works, but it is a bit harder (Best method is to use scrap wood reinforced with paper. Again, it is T H A T E A S Y).
Stage 5
[
]
The disease becomes much more infectious now, (way it spreads is via appendage-like tentacles that can spread out) and if one stands on a tentacle, they will get engulfed in glitchy, black and blue spots and will be seemingly destroyed after about 10
Voidseconds
. The original host, however, becomes still and degrades severely, until bone level is reached, and then the verse will pull the host and everyone who was infected into itself.
How to survive it
[
]
Strangely, the virus can be defeated by throwing scrapped stuff at it. The reason for this is probably because the verse/entity expects others to throw something HEAVY or POWERFUL at them, and if you use the reverse, it simply goes away. Another way to rid it is to keep feeding it stuff until it is satified and disappears, although it has not been properly tested yet.
