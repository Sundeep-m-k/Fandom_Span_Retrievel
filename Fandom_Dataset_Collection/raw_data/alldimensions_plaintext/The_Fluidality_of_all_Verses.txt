An endless sea of celestial material, but in reality it is a ‘spirit’ that gives traits to all verses… and contains them

So dense that it actually has Ωx more matter… per unit of matter.

The
Fluidality of All Verses
is a complex thing. It takes the form of an Urus (ᚢ) rune, and in nature it is acctually a sort of ‘spirit’, that gives the named property to the void. However, the Fluidality of all Verses is, an ever changing hyperdimensional ‘sea’ of space. While verses inside
TFOAV
appear solid, in this verse, they are a liquid-like “soup” of verses. Everywhere at once, ever changing. Inside it, everything is uniform. However when you attempt to enter back inside one of the TFOAVs, everything is the same again. Staying in TFLOAV too long may cause you to become one with the fluidality, as is the fate of many who failed to exit TFLOAV fast enough.
The
OAV Chain
aren’t contained by anything… physically, they have no boundary at all. Nay, instead, you have to pretty much break reality several times to exit to the next tier of OAV. This property is true for all Meta-Class 4 objects and up.
As mentioned in
TFOAV
, TFLOAV is dense. So dense that it actually has Ωx more matter… per unit of matter. This is unlike a black hole, which, albeit being infinitely dense, still has 1mu/mu. It’s strange, which is why TFLOAV is so dense. You need something as strong as
TFOAV
’s barrier to protect you.
