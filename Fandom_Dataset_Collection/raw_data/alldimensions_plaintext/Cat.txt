About
[
]
The
Cat
is an extremely powerful
entity
that has the role of the
ruler
of a
Couch
. If you hug the Cat, it will love you and give you that cute smile.
The Cat is very cute but annoying to care for. For example, it can scratch parts of a
Fried Egg
, causing existences to dissappear. It also reduces the number of parts of the Fried Eggs where there is
matter
of multiple existence states at once by splitting matter into two pieces of matter with one existence state.
Rivality
[
]
Cat's enemy is
Dogy
. The latter always hates it. Dogy has even tried to destroy Cat before. In fact, Dogy once sent them into a
Glitch Space
, and trapped Cat there for 100 octillion years before the latter escaped.
Shattered plates
[
]
Since then, fights bethween Cat and Dogy have taken place, in which more than one
That Human's Plate
has been shattered, sometimes making
Those Humans
angry and get into the fight. Those Humans are weaker than both Dogy and Cat though, so they always end up either retreating or dying in said encounters.
