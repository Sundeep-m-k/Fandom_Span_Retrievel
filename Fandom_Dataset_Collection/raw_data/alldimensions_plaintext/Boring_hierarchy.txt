One of the verses in the Boring hierarchy. Due to all of the verses appearing identical and the photographer not specifying which
verse
it was (probably because they did not know themselves), it is unknown which verse in the Boring hierarchy the verse pictured is.
The
Boring hierarchy
is a cosmological machine created by a junior
Transcendent Omni-God
for the purposes of creating a new
Hierarchical Tunnel
which it would completely control. The goal for this TOG was to achieve moderative or administrative status within its own hierarchical tunnel, and be free of the control of other administrative TOGs; however, the Boring hierarchy, being simpler in construction to even the least of the existing major Hierarchical Tunnels, created a boring hierarchy, made of the same structures repeating on themselves, amplifying the TOG's dominion by only a fixed amount rather than infinitely as it hoped.
Verses in the Boring hierarchy's hierarchy (BHH) were originally granted names, the least of them being the monoverse, and then the duoverse, and then the trioverse, and so on. Recent refinements in the Boring hierarchy have absolved the verses of inhabitants, naming, or distinguishing features; the most recently dug verse in the Boring hierarchy is the 1278232-verse, with work on the 1278283-verse currently in metaprogress.
Despite this, the TOG reports being happy with the progress of the Boring hierarchy. Some administrative TOGs are calling for the collapse of the Hierarchical Tunnel, so to avoid this, the TOG is considering transferring the Boring hierarchy to another
wikiverse
, though none sufficiently stable without their own hostile TOGs have been found.
