Glitchy
(
Glit-Xii
or
Bood-Glit-Vav
in
Puffish
) is the
god
of the
Glitchyverse
, and has full control over all
Glitch Matter
and how it affects matter. The
Chaos Entities
praise and worship him.
The Primordial
created him 3 days after birth, and clearly shows considering the chaotic form of him. Glitchy is the embodiment of the
Glitchyverse
, and the form he shows is just a manifestation of the verse.
He is one of
THE 8 DIVINE GODS
created by the already mentioned Primordial. Despite his occupation as owner of a
verse
more unstable than
BEYOND HELL
, it is actually relatively nice instead of evil, especially compared to some of the other 8 divine gods.
It is the opposite to the
Forgotten God
