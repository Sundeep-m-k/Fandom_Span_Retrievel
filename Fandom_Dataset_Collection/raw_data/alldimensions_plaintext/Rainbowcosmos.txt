The
Rainbowcosmoses
are one of the types of verses with the most color in them. They have full saturation (no grays, blacks or white). This is achieved by having
Megaelectrons
and
Megaphotons
in their core, and having most of their energetic regions cycling around every 5 minutes. Electromagnetic radiation is released as light, and constantly changes frequency as the energetic regions cycle around, forming a rainbow effect.
In all the planets of a Rainbowcosmos, 61% of the them with life (50.63% of all their planets) can have rainbows. And only 3.(1/9)% of them have eternal rainbows instead.
Inside them, there is only 1 Barrel at their center.
