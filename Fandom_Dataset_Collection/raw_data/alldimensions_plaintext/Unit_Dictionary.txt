This is the Unit Dictionary, a dictionary of various units seen in a variety of pages.
Only units specific to AD or fictional cosmology can be used in this article. Additionally, all units must be placed under the correct table/heading, and must be ordered smallest to largest.
Note that units with asterisks after them have multiple values, or are non-static. Units that have static one-value definitions based on non-static/multi-value units however, are not counted.
