The
Thank youverse
,
Thank Youverse
, or
Thankyouverse
is a
Mannersverse
, a special type of
verse
where every creature within, native or foreign, is nice in some sort of way.
In the Thank youverse, when an action is performed in relation to another creature, the creature that was related to the action will always utter the phrase "Thank you" if the creature knows English
[

]
, or an equivalent in their native language if they do not speak English.
The Thank youverse looks similar to and contains things that a regular
Universe
would, though the border has the phrase "Thank You" printed in English in a font described by
humans
as "cursive-like." The verse also contains things in a way that makes its structure
objectively
thankful.
