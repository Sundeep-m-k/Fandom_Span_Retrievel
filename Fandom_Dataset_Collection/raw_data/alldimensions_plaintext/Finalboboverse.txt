The barrier
[
]
The barrier for this verse is in the shape of a 3d
harty fractal
and is made out of
SCP-6000-B
. it also hase a negative gravitational pull, so there is a group of quadboboverses in the center.
Rules for containing
[
]
It simply contains ABSOLUTE INFINITY quadboboverses. nothing special.
The center
[
]
in the center there is a group of quadboboverses and antiquadboboverses. When they collide, they produce energy in the form of light. thats what keeps the verse lit.
Colors
[
]
The colors come from the singularity mashing (see
triboboverse
