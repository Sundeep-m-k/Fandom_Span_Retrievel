The
Cherry
is a large, frigid structure located within an
Ice Cream
, which has a very low temperature and is known for being even more impenetrable then the Ice Cream before it, with a toughness so great that the Ice Cream looks like, well, actual ice cream in comparison. The stem of a Cherry is another issue, as it is not nearly as cold as the Cherry itself nor as tough. The stem sticks out of the Ice Cream, providing boosts to its effects and giving "live nightmares" dubbed 'Daymares' by those who experience them. Although daymares are not nearly as damaging to thought and intelligence as the Ice Cream, these are highly traumatic and often lead to cardiac arrest before they're halfway through. They also take exactly 30 minutes in time of the viewer, but only 0.3 seconds to observers.
The Cherries are also covered with explosive molecules and organism-selective black holes, as in they only absorb carbon, water, and any equivalent to DNA molecules. in their radius. The Cherries have this on the outside AND inside walls of their structures, especially inside actually.
The Pits
are unaffected by these, however its residents are. No cosmic entity is able to escape the Cherries' black holes and miniature mines, as they are all sealed with a power far beyond comprehensions of even the guardians of the 12th
Everything Layer
themselves.
