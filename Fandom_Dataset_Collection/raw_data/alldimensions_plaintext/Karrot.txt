Karrot is an entity who can't be killed. Any regular god can't harm him. He also cannot harm anything at all. The only thing he can do is create things. He can't destroy anything. The things he creates are always to help someone. It doesn't matter about their intent. He can only create something every 82 minutes. He also knows how to create anything. However his powers are limited somewhat. While he can create anything it has to be within reason. If the entity he is helping needs help in a crisis of any kind then he can create stronger things.
