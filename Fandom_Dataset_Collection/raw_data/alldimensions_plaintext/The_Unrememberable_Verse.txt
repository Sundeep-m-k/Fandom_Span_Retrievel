It does not have much data known about it. This is due to its main property, where, every approx. 51.2
OYC
, all data relating to it will be erased (hence its name), with the occasional exception of memories, although this is very rare. The last periodic reset was about 0.000014
OYC
ago, AKA approximately 3-4
human
days ago when this part of the article written.
It is also difficult to recall information about the Unrememberable Verse. It is also impossible to enter the Unrememberable Verse, as all who enter, will soon exit disoriented and completely unaware of the Unrememberable Verse.
Due to the above effects, very little is known about the Unrememberable Verse, especially relating to its information deletion and inaccessibility effects.

Transcript Conclusion
[
]
Well, for one, the office, A, and B have not been conclusively identified. Not even the species. It is thought that this transcript has something to do with before a previous reset, and that TUV has far greater effects than we think.
More research still needs to be done.
