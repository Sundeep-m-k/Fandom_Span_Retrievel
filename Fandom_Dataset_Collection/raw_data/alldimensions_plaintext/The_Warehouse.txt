The
Warehouse
is a meta
boxial
verse that contains all boxes that have an existence state between
‚àí
œâ
{\displaystyle -\omega}
and
œâ
{\displaystyle \omega}
.
Despite The "Warehouse"-'s name, The Warehouse is mostly unrelated to warehouses. The only aspect in which The Warehouse is related to warehouses is that both are containers of Boxes.
Structure
[
]
The Warehouse contains many Boxes. As you go through the a box within The Warehouse, you will end up in another box containing that box, and the
existence states
of objects within those The Boxes will increase by 2.
Said sequence is centered on
The Box
, a container of Existence-0 and Existence-1, and terminates at transfinite values in both the positive and negative direction.
At the surface level, all of these Boxes are nearly identical. However, going deeper into Boxes reveals the property that
both
chaos and order levels increase as existence states increase (inverse also applies), as described in
The Supremum of Chaos
.
In the increasing existence state direction, these two opposed aspects combine into a property known as "ordered chaos", otherwise known as large structures of chaos which "act" more chaotic without
being
more chaotic. As a result of this, objects in The Boxes "above" our own either get obliterated due to massive amounts of chaos, or have their "actual chaos" reflect their "perceived chaos" (causing large amounts of chaos which eject said object out of The Warehouse).
In the other direction, this can also lead to "chaotic order", random verse formation across many spaces. These verses will randomly form/destruct, making them unreliable and useless for colonization. Eventually, this spreads through multiple iterations of
Archverses
, which will also go down and affect lower verses, making the situation even worse.
Deboxization
[
]
As you go up in either direction of Existence Rank within The Warehouse (especially in the negative direction), the
Boxial Void
's formation process breaks due to a lack of the proper existence ranks.  This will lead to Boxes slowly losing attributes like self-containment, with some Boxial Voids only containing Archverses and nothing else.
