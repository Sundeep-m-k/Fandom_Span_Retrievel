The Insane
, despite the more or equally intense name, is far more stable than
The Chaoses
it holds. All matter which
enters
The Insane is transformed into Primordium Omega, unless the matter is made of or surrounded by
Primordium Delta
. Despite being this harsh, all matter that was imagined by Alphasm was originally located in The Insane, which is a shocking amount (not including Chaoses), that is not subject to Primordium Omega's properties.
And, as mentioned before, there is a surprising amount of matter in The Insane for something that is normally very uninhabitable. The Insane is home to...
insanely
large planets and even more so stars, and they all have similarly enough sized Chaoses at the core of their cores. Gravity is somewhat off, at the smallest planets having over 34g on average, and stars ~900g. Whenever planets and stars collapse or give in, they escape to be the start of new spacial bodies. As when stars merge with planets or other stars, The Chaos within simply ejects to undergo the same prodecure.
