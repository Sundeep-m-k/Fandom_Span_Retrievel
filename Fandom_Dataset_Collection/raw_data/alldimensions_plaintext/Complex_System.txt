strung together with Beyond String, an unbreakable kind of string only found here. It's coated by more of the complexes, which are held together by the same material that makes up Cosmic Tunnels. The inside of this barrier is corrosive, so be careful there.
Getting here overwrites your level of existence to negative Infinity, causing the same effects of escaping into a cosmic complex, except worse. The existence level required to have the effects of a cosmic complex is -100, which entering a cosmic complex overwrites existence levels to -100. -Infinity has the same effects, but you don't get resurrected to a special area. Instead, you'll just see static with random times of your life appearing, and hear an annoying noise that bounces in frequency. That'll be it for the rest of eternity.
