The
Reverseverse
is a verse where everything is opposite. Even if the verse is very finite-sized, the term "reverse" so intensely rekt the verse, that even ridiculous things like life and death are reversed. Oh and I know what you are thinking. Yes, this verse's existence is flipped to negative.
This verse is not exactly one kind, but more like
belongs in the trash
concept including all of verses where they are reversed. Phenomenon creating reverseverse can only happen on verses, because so-called "structures" have natural barrier preventing them from being reversed, and so-called "property spaces" (such as a void, a space with property of emptiness), just cannot be reversed without tangling with everything and exploding.
