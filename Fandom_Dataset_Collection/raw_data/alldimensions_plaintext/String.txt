A
string
is the fundamental
building block
of
uni
verses
and everything else, as they're on such a small scale, known as the Planck scale. This means they measure a Planck Length like the quantum foam.
Strings cannot be ripped apart. Although they're one-dimensional, they're capable of affecting other dimensions anyways. They're loop-shaped and they unite the laws of the large and of the small.
Supposedly, strings vibrate in different ways, each for different types of
matter
, meaning there are many different types of strings.
Anything smaller than a string would have lengths so small that they might have lengths that wouldn't make sense in reality. The only way to circumnavigate this is to have Microdimensions.
In our cosmology, matter and
antimatter
are merged in the quantum scale by strings, although matter made of this object is
neutral matter
.
Everything in the
omniverses
usually consist of strings.
Trivia
[
]
The
Calabi-Yau manifold
is nothing else than an 11D
object
.
There is a theory that instead of ‘strings’, elementary particles may have been made of ‘
preons
’. The first model predicted 3 kinds of ‘rishons’, and these rishons could be the explanation for why there was no antimatter, it was locked up in these ‘rishons’. Nowadays, it is thought that fermions have 3 preons, and bosons have 6. There would have been 4 preons - plus, antiplus, zero and antizero, just like
kaons
.
