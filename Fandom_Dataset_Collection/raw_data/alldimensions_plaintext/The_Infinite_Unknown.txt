The
Infinite Unknown
is the beginning of multiple verses that are extremely hard to measure nearly
anything
about. The first verse, called The Infinite Unknown, is extremely dark but glows a yellow from
The Boxilism
. It is shaped like a lemniscate (infinity symbol).
Properties

The Infinite Unknown, being the first of these unknown verses, is the verse we know the most about, but it's still not much. All photons that leave The Infinite Unknown eventually return back to it, reflecting off of The Boxilism and repeating the process all over again. There are actually 4 'slices' of lemniscates behind of each other to form The Infinite Unknown, so there is not just only one.
