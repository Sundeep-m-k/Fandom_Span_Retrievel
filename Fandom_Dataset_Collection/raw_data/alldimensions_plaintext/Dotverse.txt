A Dotverse is type of universe consisting of no spatial and temporal dimensions. As there is no space and no time in this type of
Universe
If anything manages to get in (e.g. a piece of
Glitchonicite
being used), they will be stuck in the same place, unable to do anything, eventually disintegrating into literally nothing and ceasing to exist. These universes are very common in our
Multiverse
, with a 1 in 4 chance of a given
Universe
being a Dotverse. Due to their lack of dimensionality, these universes have no actual size and resemble an infinitely small point. No life or anything is possible in this universes, in fact, some think these shouldn't even be called ''verses'' since they lack a lot of the physical nature for one.
