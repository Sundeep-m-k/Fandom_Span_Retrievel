The Unknown Entity is formidable compared to some of the most powerful entities of this verse like
The almighty
,
Jerald
,
Me
,
Rompeetoe Pugnarem
and
Sarpy
(as far as to my knowledge).
theres currently no image or concrete proof of it’s power, we know it’s high enough to surpass the current AD in of itself. Only inaccurate measurements due to our current tools.
We will document the current measurements.
we don’t even know what it’s motives, purpose or even why it exists is.
Possible feats and calculations

TUE could move a single Planck length (considering it’s size is very megalophobic to even the largest entities besides it) and from that and only that, the hyperfiction (the term to describe everything that is made up regardless of definitions.) mostly breaks, even the borders between the hyperfiction and the hyperreality (the direct opposite of the hyperfiction) could’ve cracked a little bit. And nothing in hyperfiction even did anything CLOSE to that amount of damage.
TUE might be unapproachable in stats and rankings (even the planned
HyperFictional Tiering system
doesn’t fit it)
TUE seems to be the gate between hyperfiction and hyperreality.
you see, hyperreality has “authors”. these authors, when creating a piece of fiction, creates fictional energy. through TUE, said fictional energy allows itself to manifest what fiction the authors have created into the hyperfiction.
we will keep you updated as much as we can.
