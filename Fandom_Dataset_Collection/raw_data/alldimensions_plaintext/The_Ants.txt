Very powerful cosmic ants
The Ants
are a collection of extremely powerful cosmic insects similar to earthly ants, as they tend to dine on organic matter including bits of
That Human
they cut off of him when in battle with him. They are very versatile and are very powerful and intelligent themselves. Unlike earthly ants, they do not have a queen, instead, they build new Ants by arranging atoms in a very specific way.
Ants are divided based on their jobs. There are workers, soldiers and The King. Workers just find food and fight things if necessary. Soldiers are ants that are sent to make traps or attack That Human. The King is an ant that is the only on that can make ants out of atoms. He can make ants indefinitely and lives forever. He looks like an ordinary ant though.
They have a very deep rivalry with That Human, as they both dine on his
Fried Eggs
, which both sides are annoyed by. This means combat with That Human is very frequent and is often damaging, so numbers of Ants are only at about 1000 at any moment per
Other Room
. They can use their smarts to make traps, some of which have made That Human lose a finger for a few yalmeon times before he regenerated. These incidents, given a large amount of infinities of time, could lead to the eventual Ant victory within The Other Room.
