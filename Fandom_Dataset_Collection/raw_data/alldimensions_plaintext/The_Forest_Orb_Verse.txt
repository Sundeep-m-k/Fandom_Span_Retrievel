The other 3 Forest Orb Verses
The
Forest Orb Verse
is a huge artificial verse inside the
Ferroverse
. It has many planets but no stars, and all planets have forests. Most of these planets are super small, about 4km to 3km in diameter, and have no core. The surfaces of the planets are made of dirt, while the inner layer is made of stone. These planets are called Mini Forest Orbs, and orbit Forest Orbs.
Forest Orbs
are planets that are much bigger, and also contain some unforested parts (about 5% of their surface aren't forests). These planets are 67km to 56km in diameter, and are considered the stars of the verse. Forest Orbs are 20 000km to 30 000km apart from each other.
Formation
[
]
The Forest Orb Verse was made by robots built by the Zalkitans, which take stuff from the Multiverse's voids and transforms it into dirt. Then the Zalkitans built other robots that condensed the dirt into planets, and then they planted trees on them. The Forest Orb Verse was made by the Zalkitans so they could make more wood without destroying forests native to their planets, and they also made it as a way to create more breeds of trees, as they brought other species of trees from other planets that could breed with Zalkitm trees.
