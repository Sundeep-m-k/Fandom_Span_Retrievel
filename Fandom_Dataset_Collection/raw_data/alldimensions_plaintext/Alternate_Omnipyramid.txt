Alternate Omnipyramid
Location
Contained by
The Second Realm
The
Alternate Omnipyramids
are one of the only known structures in the
Second Realms
. Almost nothing is known about any other
verse
or cosmic
structure
there with that trait.
All interpretations of them have been in the form of a Sierpi≈Ñski Triangle, though this is not their true shape. They're composed of four layers: The shield, the crust, the body, and the core.

The Shield
[
]
The shield is a massive net encompassing their Alternate Omnipyramid. Anything that touches it without proper protection will be instantly vaporized. All Second Realms natives have evolved this protection.
The crust
[
]
The crust of an Alternate Omnipyramid is composed of hard and sharp rocks built together in a very odd shape. The
material
this is made of is unknown.
The body
[
]
The body of an Alternate Omnipyramid is made most of a weird fleshy, blue or black
substance
that is similar to jello in terms of matter state.
The core
[
]
Most nothing is known about the Alternate Omnipyramids' core, other than one of them is the home of the
Ealer
and has a few trees made of the same rocks as the crusts.
Strange Properties
[
]
The Alternate Omnipyramids seem to exist, but also... not exist. It is as though the structures are there but are cloaked in shadow. Does this make them
void
? If they contain something in the form of
PURE VOID.
but do not exist, does that make them void? If they do truly exist, how? And how can the Ealer live in one of these structures that do not truly exist?
