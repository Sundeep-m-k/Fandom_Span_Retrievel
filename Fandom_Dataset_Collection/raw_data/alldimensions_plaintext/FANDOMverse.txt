Introduction
[
]
The
FANDOMverse
is an extremly enormous verse that contains all existent
Wikiverses
. The contained Wikiverses are very different, and their sizes varies a lot. But no one of those can contain the FANDOMverse, no matter how big they are. The FANDOMverse is soo big, its no longer fictional, and its a real verse. Anyhow, WHAT THE! How is anything larger than the wikiverse. Some things that the FANDOMverse contains are:

The Wikiverses are enormous verses that generate lots of
pageverses
. Every single Wikiverse is extremly different to the other Wikiverses, and their size varies a lot depending of how many pageverses they have.
THE heart.
[
]
THE heart
is the biggest thing that the FANDOMverse contains. Its the main place where almost all things contained by the FANDOMverse exists. It's 4 times smaller than the Fandomverse, so you can figure how big it is. It also generates Wikiverses. Its color is yellow, and a bit golden also.
Mainpageverse
[
]
The
Mainpageverse
is the 2nd biggest thing that is contained by the Fandomverse. It works like an "wormhole" that lets you travel to ALL existant Wikiverses. It has lots of colors.
Ultima-gods
[
]
The Ultima-gods are extremly powerfull entities capable of creating impossibly infinite pageverses, or even entire wikiverses. In a more cotidian form to say that, Ultima-gods are knowed as "users". In our local wikiverse, these are knowed with the name
Trascendent Omni-Gods
.
Oristikoí theoí
[
]
Oristikoí theoís
, or "Definitive gods" are beings soo powerfull that they are even capable of disintegrating Ultima-gods and Wikiverses with ease, but they are not really destructive. They only delete things that are not allowed to exist in the Fandomverse. In a more cotidian form to say that, the Oristikoí theoís are knowed as "Fandom staff".
Shin no jōgi
[
]
The
Shin no jōgi
, or the "True ruler" is the strongest being of all the Fandomverse. It has the power to delete Oristikoí theoís with ease, and, if he wants, he could even terminate all the Fandomverse. Obviously that would never happen, because he LOVES his creation (Yes, HE created the Fandomverse). In a more cotidian form, The Shin no jōgi is knowed as the "Fandom owner".
The voiderplex
[
]
The voiderplex
is the place that ALL deleted things go. Pageverses, Wikiverses, Ultima-gods and even Oristikoí theoí can be here! (Arguably). In this place practically nothing exists, without counting the deleted things. Its the 3rd biggest thing that is contained by the FANDOMverse.
Growing of the FANDOMverse
[
]
The FANDOMverse is constantly growing, so no Wikiverse can trascend the FANDOMverse. Everytime a new Wikiverse/Pageverse is created, FANDOMverse gets a bit bigger than before.
