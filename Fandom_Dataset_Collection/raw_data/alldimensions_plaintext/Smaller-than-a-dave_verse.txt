Smaller-than-a-dave verse
is a verse that is tinnnnny, tinier than a
Dave
in fact. It is filled with
Mathons
, and each plank time it explodes and rebuilds over and over again, and releases the aforementioned particles. This unstability makes it sometimes change its location, but its always found in a
Zyoron
.
Origins
[
]
In short, this verse was made by
bean man
, who hates Daves for some unknown reason. He just took a red
star
and reduced it to the point its smaller than not only Daves, but also things like the
absolutely tiny particles
,
Structures of Nothing
,
Voidonions
and Zyorons because he REALLY wanted to make sure they remain smaller than a Dave. Now this verse is a bridge between the verse of the hierarchy above and the verse below.
