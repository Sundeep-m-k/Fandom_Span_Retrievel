Methods of access
[

there are many methods of going into The Minus World but let me just talk the easy way possible,
in 1-2, run in full speed and jump to the bricks on top
before impact, crouch while jumping, then you'll no-clipped
walk thru the wall and use the 1st or 3rd pipe but don't make the "welcome to the warp zone!" sign appear
don't use the 2nd pipe (it will send you to world 5-1)
enter the 1st or 3rd pipe
here's the animated way
Discovery

how was the Minus World discovered? its kinda hard to explain since this dimension is connected to many Mario Universes and (maybe)
The Backrooms
