Big rocks are made primarily of rock and iron, being made of 22.384% iron and 77.61592% rock respectively. 0.00007996% of the material in the Big Rock are actually not there at all, and simply very small holes that go all the way down to the core. The reason that there are so many heavy elements in Big Rocks is because the immense gravity can pull
Noröks
so close together that their centers touch and they fuse into a Norok with more points. Big rocks glow very brightly, being 10,000,000 lux bright when a kilometer away, 1,000,000 lux when a megameter away, 100,000 lux when 300 megameters away, and 10,000 lux when a gigameter away. The light from Big Rocks is generated from its core, which is a small part of it at its center that constitutes 0.00000004% of each one. At the core, the pressure is so intense that Noröks are fused into ones with eight points, which cannot exist and become raw
Primordial Hexagons
, which, as very powerful beams of light, push against the force of gravity and either lose or cancel it out, and bore small holes through the Big Rock which allow the light to escape. The equallibrium between the force at the center of the Big Rock and its gravity can only exist when it's between 327,243,788,311,692 nanometers and 327,243,788,311,697 nanometers, any less than that and gravity wins against the other forces and the Big Rock continues to grow by consuming all nearby material and has a 42.688% darker glow. When the Big Rock reaches equallibrium, most objects that get close to it are pushed away by its radiating heat, and sometimes, very occasionally, due to too many heavy elements falling down to the core, an influx of Primordial Hexagons will be created and a small piece of rock and iron from close to the center of the Big Rock will be ejected into orbit around the it. the outer layers of the
Little Rock
will rapidly decompress once out of the enormus pressure of the Big Rock.
If a Big Rock becomes larger than 327,243,788,311,697 nanometers in diameter, its gravitational pressure will increase the size of its core 36408-fold and immediately make it 40,000,000 times brighter, but the outer layers of the Big Rock become so compressed by the inward gravitational pull and outward force that they make a large, spherical core that loses over the strength of gravity, causing all the mass of the outer part of the star to crumble into itself until the star is entirely Primordial Hexagons. This first step takes 12-13

times brighter than a normal Big Rock, with so much light energy that all nearby planets are obliterated and every other Big Rock within 1 zettameter is blown away or blown to peices. This kind of event is called a Big Explode and is a very rare event. A reigon of destruction requires between 430 and 753 megacycles

to recover to a stable state after a Big Explode. Big Explodes produce many lone Primordial Hexagons, which quickly all form into lone Noröks after between 1 and 2 kilocycles
