OYC
ago, when
Bongus
was looking at this
Omniverse
, he noticed something peculiar. "A weird verse?" he thought. So he went to look. He threw an inhospitable
universe
in it. It didn't come out. He looked at the atoms and saw the makeup of
Glitchonicite
,
Toxicium
, and many other materials. He wanted to keep it a secret, so he hid it in another
Omniverse
. We didn't know it existed until 46 OYC ago, when missions to the other
Omniverses
were launched.
