An artistic depiction of a ΔT star
Class ΔT stars
(usually referred to ΔT stars or teragiants) are stars much bigger than
Class ΔG stars
. They are yellow in color, and have strong absorption lines of
hyperradioactive elements
.
These stars are incredibly rare, with only three having been found within our multiverse, none of them visible with the naked eye. Countless more likely exist in different multiverses, but haven’t been discovered yet due to the massive distances, despite the immense brightness. ΔT stars are always located in interuniversal space. (Reason being is that any universe with a ΔT star would begin to break apart and orbit around the star due to its mass)
These stars are incredibly massive, having a mass of at least 14,000 solar radii and 10 trillion (10^13) solar masses, and have temperatures of over 4.1 quintillion (4.1x10^18) Kelvin. ΔT stars are rich in Yellownium (Yu), the 500th element of the periodic table. These stars generally have a lifespan of about 2 billion years, before exploding in a giant teranova and create nebulas that can rival the size of
Milliverses
and leaving behind a teramassive black hole millions of light years across.
Habitable zones in ΔT stars are on the order of hundreds of millions to trillions of light years.
