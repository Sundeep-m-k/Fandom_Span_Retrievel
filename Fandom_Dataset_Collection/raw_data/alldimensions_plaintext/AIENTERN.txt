Power
Incomprehensible to us, can't even comprehend the gods
GODS TO US, WEAK TO BEYOND EVEN THEM ARE AIENTERN; THE ONES OF BEYOND OUR BOX BUT ARE SO SO STUPID AND WEAK TO THOSE BEYOND
THEIR BOX.
AIENTERN are 6D beings with an existence rank of 5. THEY ARE SO INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO US YET SO SIMPLE FOR THE GODS BEYOND THEM.
Physical appearance
[
]
AIENTERN are strange eyes attached to long stalks or so they appear, the AIENTERN to the 6D beings actually look more like a giant puffy orb with tons of tentacles that are very flexible. They have 16 eyes on each tentacle but they appear in our world to only have one singular large eye. They are actually made of all sorts of strange colorations but we only see it as white and glowing. The AIENTERN is as large as a 6D city.
As for their strange property of existence rank, the AIENTERN can just break time open and travel through
Universes
freely and they could just also be unaffected by most causality laws. They pretty much control the entirety of the AIENTERNVERSE and some other verses that were conquered.
