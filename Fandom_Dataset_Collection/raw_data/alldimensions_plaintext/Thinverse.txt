A Thinverse is a verse
which has a thinner barrier than most other verses.
Thinverses are formed when a verse collides with a large object and is rubbed against that object extremely hard, breaking off a huge portion of the verse's barrier which turns it into a Thinverse.
Thinverses are
very vulnerable to attacks
, even more so than an
Anchorverse
, so most civilizations who start out in a Thinverse eventually migrate out to find a less vulnerable verse to live in.
The
exact definition of a Thinverse is quite arbitrary
, although most creatures agree that a verse with at least 70% of its barrier being 10 meters or thinner is a Thinverse. Verses with no barriers at all do not count as a Thinverse.
A few Thinverses have a barrier so thin it is practically see-through. Most of these special Thinverses, known as Superthinverses, have been studied extensively.
One Thinverse is a sentient verse known as
The Real True Actual End
.
There are approximately
13
13324
{\displaystyle 13^{13324}}
Thinverses.
