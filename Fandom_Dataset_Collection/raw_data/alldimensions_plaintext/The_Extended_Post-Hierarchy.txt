The
Extended Post Hierarchy
is the fourth
hierarchy
, after the
official
,
extended
and
post
ones, containing
classes
23
to
32
. If you haven't noticed yet, all logic is completely gone by this point.
For a list of the
numbers
used, click
here
. For the elements that composes TEPH's verses, then click
here
.
The Hierarchy Rank of this hierarchy is
(H
3
)
, placing it in
class 0
in
THH
.
Same rules of previous hierarchies apply to this one, such as:
verses
being ranked from smallest to biggest, each class having a "
Terminator
" that finishes them altogether, etc.
This hierarchy is still not finished yet, having only made some progress in 31 classes out of the planned (and already mentioned at the start of the article) 32. Each class also doesn't have enough verses in them each.
