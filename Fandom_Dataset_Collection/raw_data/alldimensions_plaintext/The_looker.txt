The looker
is the "moon" of
The Fultimatum
, and also an smaller storage for verses. It also contains
Qultimatums

Temperature? Bruh, i dont need to say its random. But, there is a little more of heat in this place than in
The Fultimatum
itself, but its only a little bit.
It also has an acid in its central part, being more dangerous than the
Qultimatums
sustance, but less than
The Fultimatum
one. But, instead of red or blue, now its orange, nothig more to say.
Sorry, i dont have ideas for a funny conversation moment.
The looker can also shine a lot, like in the image. It can vary from moments. Sometimes, theres no bright, and in anothers, the whole rainbow is here! So, it could be very wholesome to look this eye, but it shines too much that it can hurt your eyes.
Unlike what you think, this eye isnt alive. It just have an appeareance of a enormous one, but its not a living being.
