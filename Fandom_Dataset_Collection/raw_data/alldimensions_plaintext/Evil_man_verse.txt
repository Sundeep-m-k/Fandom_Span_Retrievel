The Evil man verse is a very scary verse. It is way worse than the
Monolingualverse
and
Hellverse
. NEVER GO THERE OR YOU WILL BE ATTACKLED BY
EVIL MEN
and
EVIL WOMEN
AND
JEFF BEZOS
The evil man verse has been attackled multiple times by various people, but it has never been defferted.
Here are the various attempts:
1:Evil Lord King
The evil lord king.
The evil guys worshipped the Evil Lord King for years until Jeff Bezos led his Government of Evil to rule over. Soon the Evil Lord King wanted to revoinge and led his Evil Army to destroy the Evil Man Verse. The Lord King murdered 500,000 evil guys, and just when it seemed like the Lord King would win, an Evil Man called Strung Episode 89 dropped a Exaton Meteorite onto the Evil Lord King, crushing him to death.
2.Ah2
Ah2 after obľÎteräťion.
This was possibly the shortest battle ever in the entire Evil Man Verse ever, considering that Ah2 was a cockroach from the
earth
and was very small.The evil men completely ignored it. Even though it conquered 3 square centimeters of land, it was completely obliterated.
