Coreboxes
are boxes containing
ultimate cores
. They contain every possible and impossible type of energy and information that have ever existed and will exist. So it's also considered as "the box of energy and information".

This would mean a corebox is a mixture of infinitely many energies and information that can be stored. If one kind mixes with another, that'll form a whole new thing. This new energy would be much much better than the two collided. But we can reverse this process, dividing it thoroughly will make them two again. Also everything can be turned into energy or vice versa. As ultimate cores move rapidly, there are collisions of creating just the same one, except with some differences - firstly it will have to stored very much more to be able to sustain the content inside. Also, things will be altered by a lot.
At the boundaries, an impossible barrier is where it posits. This is there to keep any ultimate cores from going outside the corebox.
