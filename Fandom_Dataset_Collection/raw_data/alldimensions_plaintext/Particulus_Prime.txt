Who is Particulus Prime?
[
]
At the moment, Particulus Prime is
the most powerless
one of the most powerful
being
beings in existence. Read the infobox to learn about his very little abilities. However, it has been noticed that upon consuming
protoparticles
that he gains infinitesimal amounts of power., similar to the properties of
Bob
, except on a much lower level.
He resides in the outskirts of the first realm, which should be impossible.
Particulus Prime currently has no intentions at all as he has no consciousness, however, if enough time passes he may become powerful enough to gain his own motives. This could even be sped up with outside intervention...
