Mathematically Trancendent Values
(MTVs) are values that represent numbers that trancend mathematics and represent values that can no longer be defined by a single form of math.
٢

The least significant MTV known as ٢  represents a number opposite to the base value. The base value is a number in all systems which can be acted upon by any operations to make any number and can be achieved through operations of other numbers. Given this definition, the opposite of a base number would be a value that cannot be acted upon by any operations to make any other number and cannot be achieved through operations of other numbers. An example of what ٢ would do in our

where n is any number.
