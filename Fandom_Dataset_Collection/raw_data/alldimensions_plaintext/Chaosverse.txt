The
Chaosverse
is basically a
Universe
, but it's fabric of spacetime has an anomalous and chaotic property that causes it to form spontaneous gravitational wells that have no material source. These gravitational events are typically extremely frequent and happen most frequently where there is a massive amount of matter or energy, this makes formation of celestial bodies other than molecular clouds and stars rare due to them being constantly interrupted by the gravitational wells. This anomaly is theorized to be from the
Uqraek fibers
of the
Chaosverse
having exotic energy applied to it from 2nd dimensional verses overlapping with a
Chaosverse.
after the subdimension's complete translation of the verse, the spacetime fabric will gain this anomaly, therefore turning it into a
Chaosverse
. This event usually occurs during the early stages of the former universe. This has a 1/
G
64
(Graham's number)
chance of occurring.
Appearance
[
]
The
Chaosverse
appears to be mostly made up of extremely hot molecular clouds with particles that move at speeds of 14 to 70 million kilometers a second, tearing apart anything that falls into them. This heat and brightness is induced by extreme instances of the gravitational anomaly that causes particles within the molecular clouds to collide and create a massive amount of kinetic energy. Why these events don't always form stars is due to the gravitational anomalies only lasting a short period of time, which doesn't allow enough time for formation to begin.
Whenever stars even form their protoplanetary rings they are frequently disrupted by said anomalies which doesn't allow protoplanets to form. Stars usually don't lasts more than a 10-100 million years due to being ripped apart.
