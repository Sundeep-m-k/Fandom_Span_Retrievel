Cellular Level (-1.0)

You guys are just cells huh? (how are you even reading this) The first thing you wanna do is find some way to make energy, be it photosynthesis or mitochondria. After that, start grouping up with other cells and assigning specialized tasks, in order to get up to the multicellular level.
Fish Level (-0.5)

Leaving the multicellular level is more complicated. Try to evolve a way to use the atmosphere the get energy, be it with the oxygen or something else. Get some limbs if you haven't already, preferably 4 if your planet has average gravity. If you're in an underground ocean, then your entire species is gonna have to dig its way out through several kilometers of rock, sucks to suck i guess!
P.S. if you use photosynthesis then try to fight the urge to become stationary forever because that WILL make you unable to progress!
Land Level (-0.2)

Alright, you managed to start living on land. The best course of action is to become bipedal (use the back legs only and stand upright). Get some opposable thumbs, and use them to smash some rocks together and make stone tools.

Your society has got tools, great! Well, it's time to start inventing stuff. Make an economy system and organised society and stuff! Here are some tips:

The Wheel: If you got a circle and cut a hole through it, you can make it go through a pole slightly smaller than that hole. If you get four wheels in a rectangular shape, you can make a little primitive car, which is unfortunately useless for now if you don't have species that can move faster than you and are strong.
Fire: If you smash two rocks together, then it can make a tiny spark. Do it on some flammable material, and you got fire, which can cook your food, heat you up and light things up! Don't touch it though, or you'll get hurt or die. Also, be sure that the flammable stuff doesn't run out, or the fire is extinguished.
Language: If you have a body part like a mouth that can make different sounds (if you don't evolve one or use something else) then you can make a system where sequences of sounds mean different things or actions, and use it to communicate ideas to other people.
Farming: If your planet has a type of plantlife, then you can put its seeds in the ground and water it everyday to make it grow. When it's finished, you can harvest the free food and continue the cycle!
Kilns and Furnaces: If you put fire in a box and a grid on top, you can place food on top of it to cook the food or clay to harden it and make bricks.
Also, don't fight other people / tribes please, cooperation is way better than war (I'm a
human
so speaking from experience).

Writing: You can make a system to convert language into glyphs (for example, different sounds have different glyphs) and vice-versa so you can write knowledge and ideas down, which is what I'm doing!
Copper: If you can heat a kiln or a furnace real hot, you can put a copper mineral in a pan and you get liquid copper, which when cooled, makes copper metal, which is better than stone for tools!
Bronze: If you heat a copper and tin mineral together, they mix and make bronze, which is even better!
Glass: You can use the same process as copper but with sand to make glass, which you can see through. Instead of using this for tools, you can use this in homes to look outside.
Compass: If you have a piece magnetic metal which is suspended in place, then you'll see it rotates towards a particular direction. This is actually one of the poles of the planet, and they normally don't move much, so you can use this in navigation to not get lost!
Iron: If you can heat a kiln / furnace even hotter than with copper, you can make iron, which is even better than bronze for tools!
Gears: If you get a wheel and put protrusions all over its circumference, you can get lots of them together and interlock them so that if one of them spins, all of them spin - If you can figure out the gear's intricacies, then you can use it along with other things to create mechanisms!

Pendulum Clock: You can use gears and pendulums to make a clock that can be used to tell the time.
Telescopes: Plan out your astronomical journey by using a telescope - a tube with a lens that amplifies far-away objects - to look at the planets you see. Requires glass.
Printing Press: You can use complex mechanisms and letter stamps to make a printing press, that lets you write fast and heavily speeds up the diffusion of new ideas.
After figuring all of these things out, the last step of part 0.4 is the steam engine - a machine that uses coal to boil water into steam and uses that steam's pressure to pull a piston back and forth, with that energy being turned into rotational energy and being used in heavy industrial machines. This is a very important technology, and you can't progress without it!
