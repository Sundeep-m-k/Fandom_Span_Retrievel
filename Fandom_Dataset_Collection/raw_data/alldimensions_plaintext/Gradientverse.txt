The
Gradientverse
is a verse that is, like the name says, has a gradient between two colors, of which the color options are red, yellow, and blue. This is because it is constructed from a grid of
projoverses
of mixed colors, and because of an unknown reason, it makes a gradient shade between the three colors.
Gradientverses are similar to
toruchains
, because they are related to having two different colors.
