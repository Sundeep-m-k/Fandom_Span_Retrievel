A
dream
is a type of verse, where in each one there is a being known as
Dreaman
. They're the ones who control them. In this verse we find all the unnatural things that we do not see in reality, and instead the illogical ones are found.
These are the place of all Dreamcore places, feelings, and all entities, and all of those were made by their local Dreamen  except for the black voids, those were created by
تs
.
