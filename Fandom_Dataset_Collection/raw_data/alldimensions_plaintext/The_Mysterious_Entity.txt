We don't know what it could create next...

Research Attempts

Many people have attempted to study this mysterious entity. They never came back. It could have been the mysterious entity, or maybe they couldnt find it and ran out of fuel, food, and water? One of these attempts, they had a camera and something to transmit the audio from there to here. But, the camera went out, and they heard noises.
Bad noises.
Then they couldnt hear anything from the space ship. One thing we do know, is that it could exist. And it could be evil.
