x - spatial dimensions
y- time dimensions
Example:

n verse
dimensionality: x+y
or
abobaverse
dimensionality: 10+15.
that is, in order to say how many spatial dimensions and temporal ones it is necessary to write down as if we add spatial dimensions to temporal ones.
super complex dimensions

the coin
contains all the time with all possible time dimensions and this is one big super timeline. In fact, it is not clear whether time dimensions are a timeline or just  more than one time dimension, we cannot understand more than one. super complex dimensions for end of 4th class
z- number of super timelines
example:
[
]
coin container
dimensionality: x+y*z
or
rlkfrkofoverse
dimensionality 3+7*8
so we learned not only the time and spatial dimensions, but also the number of super timelines in it. By the way, each super timeline can have a different number of time dimensions.

if the number of time dimensions is not specified in some verse, it means that he has as many time dimensions as in the previous verse in which the number of time dimensions is indicated.
