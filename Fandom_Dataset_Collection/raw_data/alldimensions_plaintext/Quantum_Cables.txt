Quantum cable
This is a quantum cable
Quantum cables
are huge cables that are made out of
dark matter
. They are used to hold
universes
together, and they can stretch infinitely without losing any
mass
as they do so. They also keep their density as they stretch.
Relation with universes
[
]
When a universe is born, it doesn't have any quantum cables, so it expands insanely fast and reaches very high temperatures, but soon develops quantum cables to hold the universe together. As a result, the size of a universe is determined by how many quantum cables it has.
There is one exception to this however.
Inferno
verses never develop quantum cables to hold themselves together. As a result, they become insanely hot and the border of the verse becomes like a
gravastar
. They also are guaranteed to explode sometime in the future, as the border cannot hold the universe together once it reaches a limit.
Artificial
use
[
]
Quantum cables can be manufactured by companies and nations through cosmos in order to be sold and hold universes together.
