AtoM holding elemental particles together
AtoM AKA Keeper of the elements is a cosmic entity who holds every object we see with our naked eye. He doesn't just sit there and hold our universe in his hands, he observes, keeps track of and protects our realm from collapsing. He is one of the 5 creations of
Apex
. He lives in a higher dimension world invisible to us ( he literally sits next to us ). His 4 other brothers are
Oracle
( Emperor of time ) ,
Enigma
( Creator of Light ) , Phantom ( Holder of the natural forces ) , Doctor V ( Guardian of Life ).
Elemental particles started to form once time began. AtoM has the power to completely evaporate every object you see RIGHT NOW, just with the click of a finger. While it is not know if he will do that,
Apex
watches over him, just in case he tries to destroy us.
