Properties
[
]
Luz Azul has two (2) giant "Beams" made of
Primordium Omega
that sprout from its north and south poles. These beams seem to "Take" anything that comes within a certain radius of them. If Luz Azul does capture something, it will be brought into its mass and be destroyed instantly, regardless of what or how large it is. After this happens, Luz Azul's beams will grow and be able to suck up more objects in the
Infinityverse
.
Luz Azul's beams are seemingly able to move and locate objects that it can consume.
