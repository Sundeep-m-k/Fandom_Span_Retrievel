The Bathverse is the endless surroundment around all object verses. It looks like a bath, and it contains many baths. Scrubbin in the tub, rub a dub dub.
It is kind of like the Bnathverse but ten million times larger and better. It is absolutely amazing. It won the Interversal World Record for the Best Verse 10^3449 times in a row. By the way, the
Whydothenamesoftheseverseskeepgettinglongeriguessitwasinspiredbyminerverse
is the last object verse in the
Appleverse
series, but there are many other object
verse
chains as well. The
Marioverse
chain is a pretty cool one and it also inspired the names in the Appleverse series to be so long.
