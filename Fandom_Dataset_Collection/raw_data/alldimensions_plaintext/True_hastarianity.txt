This is a verse with equal size to An object with the size of A

(in existence ranks). It is a superior nonscriptable verse that cannot be destroyed by any entity (execpt

and some more). Anything that claims it is above it is collapsed into smaller than it. It endlessly contains itself which means itâ€™s endlessly growing faster and faster every NBCU.
why this is unsurpassable
[
]
this does not contain because containment is a concept any concept is contained. Nonconcepts are because they are words. This is beyond terminology, scriptability and ineffability itself. It is unrefrencable so if it is referenced then the page referencing it is instantly below it. This is because it is absolutely inapplicable and unusable.
