The Wakabverse (also known as the Pencilverse) is a verse ruled over entirely by
Pencils
. It has 3 layers of stuff.
Layer 1
[
]
Layer 1 is covered completely in a strange, yellow, haze. Instead of space, it appears to be one, big, flat, planet. No one knows why, but the
Pencils
are working to find out. The ground is made of a hard, rocky, substance that is really hard to break. This layer is dangerous because Erasers can get here easily.
Layer 2
[
]
Layer 2 does have space, and is about twice as hard to get to as Layer 1. This is where most pencils live.
Layer 3
[
]
Layer 3 also has space, and is about 7x as hard to get to as Layer 2. At the center of Layer 3, there is a kingdom.
The Wakab
lives here.
