The Ordinal Kardashev Scale is a ordinal version of the
Transversal Kardashev Scale
. And it works better. It is used to measure how powerful a civilization or
Cosmic Entity
is.
Define a
Verse
that has no other verses in it as a Order-0 Verse, such as the
Universe
.
Define a Verse that has Order-0 Verses in it as a Order-1 Verse, such as the
Multiverse
.
Define a Verse that has Order-
α
{\displaystyle \alpha}
Verses in it as a Order-(
α
+
1
{\displaystyle \alpha+1}
) Verse.
If a Verse as multiple orders of verses inside it, say it has the most common one.
