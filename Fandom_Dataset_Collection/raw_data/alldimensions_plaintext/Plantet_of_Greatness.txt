Plants of Greatness
A
Plantet of Greatness
is a large type of
planet
inhabited only by plants, and is constantly warm thanks to the core of their local
Universes of Greatness
.
A Plantet of Greatness has a very high land/sea ratio, with very few lakes and streams. The dirt is very moist and water is generated from the core of the planet, so this doesn't really hurt the non-aquatic plants. In order to keep things going, some
Plants of Greatness
inhale oxygen instead of Carbon Dioxide.
The Plantets' size doesn't vary much, at most by a few miles (which is pretty much none, even for
verses
from
much earlier
classes
), and their organization is very neat within their
Galaxy of Greatness
. Not much else aside from...
Death Dust
[
]
Death dust is the greatest danger on most Plantets of Greatness, as it is the only thing the plants have to worry about. If you were to touch this stiff, the part that made contact would dissolve into goo.
This stuff is made up of highly dense bacterial and viral populations which can eat up anything remotely organic, including consciousness. The plants have very high-level defenses against this stuff, and you should too before touching this fust. It is very abundant on the Plantets and resembles flakes of plaque. Natural samples of this
material
tend to be around 1000Ã— the size of average
Cells of Greatness
