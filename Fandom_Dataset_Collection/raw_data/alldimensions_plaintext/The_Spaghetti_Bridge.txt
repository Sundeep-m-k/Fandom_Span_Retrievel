The
Spaghetti Bridge
is so "disorderly" that it can't be considered a verse. The bridges can also seemingly phase through matter with no problems.
These bridges are very long, but are handicapped by the fact that they can't go into the
The Inaccessibleverse
.
Here are the layers:

Layer 1
[
]
This is the surface layer. It is the size of a
Megaverse
.
It contains broken spacetime that accelerates forces a lot (multiplies forces by 17 doedecillion in one second.)  Starting with enough speed to escape
The Box
, you could escape a
Cetaverse
in less than 1 second using this layer. You could also escape a
Mandelbrotverse
starting with enough speed to escape
The Box
. This could take from a little over a second to a little over two seconds. However, once you escape the
Mandelbrotverse
with these speeds, random things inside of you get teleported to Layer 2 of the bridge, until you vanish.
Layer 2
[
]
This layer is the explanation for why random things teleport if you escape the
Mandelbrotverse
using the Spaghetti Bridge. This part is broken enough to attach to any object that touches it. When this touches the
Void Plane
outside of the
Mandelbrotverse
, it glitches out of existance. After that, another part of Layer 2 takes the place of the part that was destroyed, causing the attached thing to teleport to the new piece.
