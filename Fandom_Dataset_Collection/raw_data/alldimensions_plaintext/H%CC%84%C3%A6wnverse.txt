History
[
]
H̄æwnverse was discovered in 2287 by a Thai called Varunvirya Damrongsak, when he was analyzing universes in the UCZ (Universe Concentration Zone). He saw a weirdly shaped universe, and he thought this verse was shaped like a flying saucer. But in 2325, another Thai, called Tarrin Rojjanasukchai, observed the same universe with a more powerful telescope, confirming that it wasn't saucer-shaped, but a spherical verse with rings. He decided to call this universe มิติของแหวน, or H̄æwnverse.
