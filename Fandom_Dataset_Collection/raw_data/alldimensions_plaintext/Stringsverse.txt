The
Stringsverse
is an extremely rare and short-living universe, lasting only 10^-21 seconds. Despite its small time-period, Stringsverses are usually 3.025 trillion light years in size and can dispute the evolution of other universes heavily.

The Stringsverse is made up of particles called ''strings'' I won't go into them in full detail here so if you want to learn more visit this page:

10^-100000000099732222200000000000283 seconds after birth: the Strings-verse is as big as an apple.
10^-9999999937000000000000008 seconds after birth: Stringsverse cools down from 1,420,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 degrees Celsius to 1,420,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,00 degrees Celsius, making conditions slightly more habitable for string-based life.
10^-9999333333487483 seconds after birth: inflation rapidly grows from the size of the solar system to the size of the observable universe.
10^-88888536 seconds after birth: Stringsverse cools down from 1,420,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,00 degrees Celsius to 1,420,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 degrees Celsius, which begins the ''dark'' age of the Stringsverse.
10^-333 seconds after birth: the Stringsverse starts a ''big crunch''
10^-21 seconds after birth: the Stringsverse implodes to make materials for other universes.
What if a Stringsverse formed inside another universe?

That universe will be ripped apart, and the Stringsverse would be transformed into a short-lasting universe, lasting 0.63 years.
Laws of physics
[
]
if a strings-verse was long enough to form laws of physics, here is what they would be.
Teleporting strings: if a string had a slightly lower temperature than the strings around it, it would teleport from one corner of the string verse to the other as the extreme density in a string-verses mass shoots particles around.
Non-string calamity: if a gold atom hits the string-verse, its life-span will be shortened from 10^-21 years to 10^-102 years.
Border collapse: if a stringsverse is in a tight space, it will turn into a sort of ''string black hole''
