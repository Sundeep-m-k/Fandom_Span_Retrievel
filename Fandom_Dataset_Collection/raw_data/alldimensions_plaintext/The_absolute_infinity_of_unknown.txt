The
absolute infinity of unknown
is a verse that, like the
other two
before it
, has almost no information about it, even less than
the inaccessible cardinal of unknown
, for it is even harder to obtain.
Known facts
[
]
Like we already said, the absolute infinity of unknown has almost no information in it. Here is a list of known facts about it (it's very short):
It glows blue (we don't know why).
It is shaped like the symbol for
absolute infinity
, which is how it got its name.
All things that try to leave it will find its way back to the absolute infinity of unknown. The only known way to escape is through extended reverse quantum tunneling.
We know its dimensionality, Kardashev, and size (see infobox).
