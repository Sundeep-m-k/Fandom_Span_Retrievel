The
Generic Hierarchy's
Omniverses
(also known as
Generic Omniverses
) are variations of the average
Omniverses
, that being the reason their names are similar.
The main difference between normal and Generic Omniverses is their size, dimensionality and
finality index
, since Generic Omniverses have the same size, dimensionality and n-finality as a
Box
, though lacking the self-containing properties the latters have while having an appearance more similar to the one of a normal Omniverse with a slighty darker color scheme. This is because Generic Omniverses arent as dense as their common counterparts.
Generic Omniverses also exclusively contain generic variants of
Ultraverses
and
Hyperverses
in them instead of their
normal
counterparts
.
Omniversal Waves
are produced by them, but in higher quantities and with less frequency. This is due to their size which allows to concentrate them for longer before releasing them all at once. Generic Omniverses that are too filled with the Waves may become slighty unstable, but this effect stops happening when they release.
