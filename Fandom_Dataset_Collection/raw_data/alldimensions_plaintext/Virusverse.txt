A
Virusverse
is a type of verse that can severely damage a
Computerverse
. They come in many different varieties. Some are more dangerous than others. It’s actually impossible to take an image of a Virusverse, due to it being
[REDACTED ERROR]
dimensional. Cameras and telescopes can’t view this type of dimension due to the way they are coded. Even if someone takes an picture of a virusverse, the camera will glitch out of existence, entering in a place way less known than even the
Backrooms
.
