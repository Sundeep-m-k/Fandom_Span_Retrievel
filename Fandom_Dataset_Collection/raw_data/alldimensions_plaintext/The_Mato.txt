Versal Structure
[
]
The Mato is shaped like a hemisphere, and it has a gravity field spanning the entire verse that points down to the flat region. This gravity field's force is 9m/s
2
(a bit smaller than Earth's), so if you were standing in this verse you would fall down like if you were in a
planet
. The flat portion of The Mato is solid and made of silicon
cuandide
sand with a depth of 2m. The rest of The Mato is composed of a gas composed of mainly xenon, with an atmospheric pressure of ~1atm. This means that a
Human
can exist in The Mato with just an oxygen mask. Yahoo!
