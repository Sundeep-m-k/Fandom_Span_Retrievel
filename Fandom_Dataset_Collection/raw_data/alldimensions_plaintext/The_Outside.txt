An
Outside
is a space of nothingness right outside of the
Omniverses
. Their diameter is roughly equivalent to 100000 Omniverses on average.
Because of their configuration, they only consist of isolated pure
existence-0
objects
,
which helps stop
Barrels
from causing immense entropy increases and chaos due to the fact that things would stuff them and create a mess of
sub-structures
.
The Outsides
are here, because nothingness is an opposite parallel to existence, which implies that instead of nothingness forming chaos over time, nothingness forms order over time. These effects magnify as one gets closer to the edges of existence and nothingness due to stronger "competition". This explains why an Outside is so strict that it resists almost everything and even every nothing.
Escaping
[
]
Despite the strictness of this bubble of nothingness, there
is
a way to escape them. If you manage to turn particles in a great enough radius around the edges of everything and every nothing into clumps of "nothing", then your distance to the edge will be compressed into 0, a point of infinite order and disorder. The order and disorder combines into a "meta-disorder", turning into a structure that is infinitely "ordered" and infinitely "disordered", which covers a wide enough scope that it breaks logic, allowing tunnels of customized laws and disorder that allow travel to a Barrel's
outside, or if you are precise enough with the way you break logic barriers, even reaching the outside of a
Box
is possible. From this point, bigger structures can be traveled to.
Malpractices
[
]
However, nowadays, reaching the outside of said Box is getting harder and harder, and said difficulty accelerates. This is due to the fact that travels to the Outsides have left glitchy regions that are corrupting both Omniverses and Outsides, which delete the more unstable regions of both by natural selection, leaving the more stable regions that are harder to break through.
Also, some groups have intentionally gone out to stabilize or destabilize the edges between both for various reasons, such as preventing
entities
from reaching high-level structures, or to trap entities in the edges between both verses. In addition, there is a common practice, called
Entity Fishing
, wherein entities are lured to the edges, only to be erased in an infinitely strict world that destroys itself. A
material
known as
Logicium
can be obtained through Entity Fishing. This material can override the laws of
verses
and structures.
Some entities have done this infamous practice so many times that they are able to bypass enough barriers to reach
Nigh Ascendant Omni-God
status, but nowadays, said title is hard to get due to traps and measures set up by
Ascendant Omni-Gods
, like
Alphasms
. In fact, only a group named
Alpha
managed to pull off the "upgrade" before the measures were put in place in our Outside, being the discoverers of
Entity Fishing
themselves. Soon after they were upgraded, our Alphasm
,
named after
Alpha
, which he ironically was trying to stop, would set up measures so rigid that only entities controlling more than the
Nigh Omnipotence Barrier
would be able to upgrade themselves to such an outrageous status.
Structures in the Outsides
[
]
Imaginary Dodecahedra
- Since Archverses are located all over the Omniverses, and Imaginary Dodecahedra bind Universes to make large-scale structures within
Multiverses
, it isn't all that uncommon for those located at the "edge" of the Omniverses to simply diffuse them out. Since the Outsides only contain existence-0 objects, the Universes they bind will be decoupled and left to wander in their Multiverse.
Universe
matter - Sometimes, Universes deal with matter that breaks its laws of physics by changing its existence rank. Specifically, existence rank 0 is the most common one. In the same way that Imaginary Dodecahedra were mentioned, this matter can slowly diffuse out.
Particle
globules - Rogue free-roaming particles will encounter many other particles and particle-like matter. If these particles and matter have attractive properties, they may created globules of random discarded particles along their journey. If such a globule gets large enough, it may start picking up non-particle debris. If these particles become non-existent along the way, or start off as being non-existent, they may make their way out of their local Omniverse.
Primordial
Imaginary Cubes
- Primordial Imaginary Cubes were the equivalent of Imaginary Dodecahedra in the very early Omniverses. However, as the laws of those Omniverses slowly changed over time, Primordial Imaginary Cubes slowly started getting forcefully diffused through their barrier and wandering out, whilst regular Imaginary Cubes weren't affected. Since their velocities were non-zero, and since so much time has passed, most Imaginary Cubes now reside in a cloud midway into their Outsides.
Civilizational bases and modes of transport - There are many post-Omniversal civilizations residing within the Outsides, as well as Omniversal ones that have research centers out there, and many simply wish to reside within
voids
and yet remain in close contact with the Omniverses, for various reasons.
