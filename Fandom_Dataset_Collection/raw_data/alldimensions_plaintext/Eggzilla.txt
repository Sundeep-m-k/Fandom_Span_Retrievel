Information
[
]
Eggzilla, otherwise known as
The Egglord
or
Gigayolk
, is the Creator of the
Eggverse
. He is omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent. Eggzilla is a powerful extradimensional entity with early evidence of an earthly presence, dating back to 7000 BCE in ancient
Eggopotamia
.
Creation
[
]
Eggzilla was materialized by
Avius
, the Great Chicken. However, his essence has always existed. He is the creator of eggs in the Eggverse. The eggs that are in other universes do not have origins native to the universes they are spotted in. This is known as an egg phenomenon, some of the most ancient civilizations of mankind worshiped Eggzilla because they couldn't explain the mysterious appearances of these eggs. All eggs naturally stem from the Eggverse. In other words, all eggs are aliens. In modern times, eggs are viewed as a normal, every-day aspect of our world. In the egg realm, he is accompanied by a host of
eggels
.
Ranks
[
]
The position of "Egglord" was created when the first
Galactic Eggpire
was established. The Egglord is the cosmic emperor of the eggpire and the leader of all eggs. An egglord can be voted out of this position by the
High Council of the Egg Realm
, which is a council of Eggzilla's most trusted harbingers. Eggzilla is the original and current egglord. While he won't always remain in this particular position, he will always be a god and will therefore always have complete control over the Eggverse.
Offspring
[
]
His eldest child is the powerful demigod
Humpty Dumpty Jr.
and his youngest child is the slightly less powerful but still important demigod
Humphrey
. Eggzilla himself is the offspring of Avius, the Great Chicken.
Dominions
[
]
While Eggzilla's material form exists in the Eggverse, his essence/spirit exists in the
egg realm
, a higher dominion of his. The egg realm is only called that by mortal beings. It's called something else in the notorious interdimensional langauge
Eggish
, but the language isn't comprehensible by mortal beings so we will never know what they call it.
The Eggverse is the dominion/universe Eggzilla watches over from his palace in the egg realm. Everything is shaped like eggs in this universe. Every being in the Eggverse is an anthropomorphic egg and that is the form Eggzilla takes whenever he spends time in this universe.
