The Rainbow Universe or UNI-827 is a
universe
which looks like a normal universe and is located in our
Local Universe Supergroup
(Farnokhil Universe Group to be exact). It contains rainbow
Galaxy filaments
and everything is rainbow all the way down to the
Blueprint Particles
. It’s also a little smaller than our
Universe
, being about 5
Galaxy filaments
big.
UNI-827 is rainbow because of a minor deviation in its laws that changes the frequencies of its light and leads to it having more matter and brighter matter, causing human eyes to view the universe as rainbow.
Formation
[
]
UNI-827 was formed from the supernova of a
Purple Quettagiant
9.7 billion years ago. It's thought that a high amount of
Thuons
in the stellar remains changed the laws of the universe at its birth.
