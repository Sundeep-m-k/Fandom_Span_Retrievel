The
Hexacubeverse
is a large hexahedral
verse
that contains a few nested instances of the lower iterations of Cubeverses within.
The Hexacubeverse is conjoined to another instance of itself.
They are both hosted within a Concube, an even larger cube holding the laws of the connected structures stable.
Both cubes have a nest notation of [3(2,1,0)].
