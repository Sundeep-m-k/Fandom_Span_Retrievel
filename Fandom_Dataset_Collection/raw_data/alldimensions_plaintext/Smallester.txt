are even more microscopical versions of
Smallests
.
Smallesters are located inside the center of their Smallests, and just like them they're also ridiculously unstable and can create explosions larger than their local
Fricknia
. Smallesters donâ€™t even need to have anything touch them for them to explode; they will just explode randomly at times without warning, though instances of this happening are very few.
No known lifeforms exist within them. The temperature of a Smallester is unknown too. Fortunately, only 1 Smallester can exist at a time within a Smallest. Once that Smallester dissapears / explodes, a new one will form in 25-400
OYC
if its local Smallest survives.
