Jeulawed Itself:
[

Jeulawed is the start of all and the end of all, Embodying The Flow of Causality (total start of all) and The Hard Stomp of Oblivion (total end of all), it is beyond insanity, chaos, order, sanity, all those concepts of like a system of sorts, You don't delete Jeulawed, Jeulawed Makes you not do that(file manipulation ain't doing squat), You don't write Jeulawed, Jeulawed Authors all Authors,
He
is The Start and The End, The True Alpha and Omega, Jeulawed is beyond any type of numberologial/numberical structures and such because it made those in the first place, "What does Jeulawed Rule Over?" That's a simple question, "
The Ones that lie beyond "
who are TOTLB? well they're the "spawn" of Jeulawed, Embodying concepts and such, If one of TOTLB is the Embodiment of contradictions, paradoxes or anything similar in that manner, Then Jeulawed is beyond that concept, Jeulawed doesn't play by the rules, He made them, While the
ancient overlord
kinda got weakened over time because TAO is a damn grandpa, Jeulawed got STRONGER, Jeulawed Sees Everywhere and Nowhere and Even Dreamumwhere(DREAMUM for those who that aren't aware is a state where you're between existence and non-existence) so no matter what, JEULAWED IS AMWAYS WATCHING, even if you managed to kill Jeulawed, Jeulawed defies death because it is the maker of death so you can't kill Jeulawed No matter what, No possible or Impossible Timeline would have you killing Jeulawed, Jeulawed is beyond space-time, Existence and NON-EXISTENCE, DREAMUM too, Jeulawed is the one who makes the story, opens the story, and ends the story.
