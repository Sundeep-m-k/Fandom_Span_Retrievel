About
[
]
A
Superplanet
is an EXTREMELY large
type of
planet
that has an unimaginably small amount of chance to be found naturaly, as they usually have a 1 in 250 quadrillion chance of forming without artificial procedures within a
Universe
.
Achieving the "super" status
[
]
In order for a planet to gain the super status, they have to be at least 1,000 light years big.
Formation
[
]
Superplanets can be created from a nigh-countless amount of normal planets and/or pieces of other superplanets colliding with eachother thanks to gravity.
Amount
[
]
There are currently at least 23,465,000 superplanets in
our
local
Multiverse
, with the biggest one currently being 453.265 billion light years in size. This means that superplanets' size ranges from at least comparable to tiny
galaxies
to even larger than entire Universes In size.
Supermoons
[
]
Sometimes, superplanets have
supermoons
. They are also incredibly dense at their core, so much so that it makes a
Neutron Core
, which are
neutron
stars
that are at the cores of superplanets.
Life and technology
[
]
73.9% of superplanets in our multiverse have
life
. But most of those planets have next to no life on them. The reason for this is because most Superplanets don't have enough light by their star, which are mostly smaller than the superplanet. only 0.032% of planets in Our multiverse have a large enough star to have life on it on all of their surface. They also have a Kardashev Scale of 1 because at it's most basic level, superplanets are still technically planets. So that means that they are in
star systems
, which means that their Kardashev Scale is 1. Only 412 billion
civillizations
that are from a superplanet in our Multiverse have fully colonized it and turned their civillization into a Kardashev Scale of 1. (That might seem a like a lot, but this is a survey lasting for 10
9
years.)
Stability
[
]
Superplanets (according to the laws of physics) aren't supposed to exist at all, because they would collapse into
black holes
, because their core would be so dense and so compressed that
matter
would collapse on itself. So by that logic, you might think that superplanets are ticking time bombs that will guarantee to collapse on themselves at any minute, right? Well, there is no superplanets in our universe, but in other universes, there are different laws of physics that can't be comprehended by ours. And because of that, superplanets can exist without them randomly collapsing for being too big and dense.
Also, the cores of superplanets are so unimaginably dense, it can sometimes make a whole new type of matter called
Ignaukuarkium
. This is the stuff that prevents superplanets from collapsing because of their immense gravity. However, if they have too much of it for their size, the gravity will be too much and the affected planet will condense, but not collapse. But if the superplanet is overloaded with ignaukuarkium, it will become so condensed with gravity that it will no longer be a superplanet, instead, it will become a
Psuedo-Star
because it will be too hot, but if you put even more, it will turn into a
Quasi-Star
and if there is even MORE of the stuff, than it will completely collapse and turn in a different kind of Supernova, called an
Ultranova
, which are orders of magnitude more powerful than hypernovas. But if it has too little ignaukuarkium, it will have too little gravity and break apart.
The remnants that are from the affected superplanets are called
superplanet Remnants
. Those Remnants will turn into more superplanets if they're REALLY big, but they'll turn into regular planets otherwise. In fact, even a 1,000 Lightyear-Sized Superplanet (Which is the lowest size for a superplanet) can break apart into superplanet Remnants that can turn into quadrillions of planets.
