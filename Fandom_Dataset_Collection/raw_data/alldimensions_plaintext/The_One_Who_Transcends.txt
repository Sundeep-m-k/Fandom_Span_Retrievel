TOWT, or “The One Who Transcends,” transcends himself and everything else at the most stupidly fast rate: The speed of the evolution is BEYOND ANY MEASURABLE OR CONCEIVABLE, OR POSSIBLE SPEED and is INFINITELY BEYOND INSTANT. He transcends HIMSELF, giving himself more power as he continues transcending himself. He transcends the very concept of gods, the very idea of power and the very origin of existence and the meaning of transcendence. TOWT transcends ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. Whatever it is, he transcends it, even the supposed highest forms of power, he transcends. Unfathomably powerful aspects of God, he transcends. Fictional characters and omnipotent concepts, he transcends. Otherworldy dreaming monsters like Azathoth, he transcends. TOWT is so stupendously powerful, to the point where "power" lose meaning, as he transcends the very idea, concept and narrative of power itself. He has reached a state that is so incomprehensibly and fundamentally impossible, that no other being could achieve. TOWT does the job of transcending, except he does it infinitely, leading to paradoxes, in which he transcends continuously, as this will go infinitely and without end to his growth of power. Nothing can stop his rate, not even imaginative beings that come from people’s minds, where their minds give the imagination power for the being that is hypothetical, no, he transcends that. He is beyond boundlessness itself, he is beyond infinity itself, he is beyond omnipotence itself. He is what surpasses the unsurpassed, he is what defies the impossible, he is what conquers what it means to nullify. Each time something is above him, he is already above them. He can also achieve anything, due to him transcending it. These could include dividing by zero, killing Nothing when "nothing could kill him," ability to kill imagination, winning an underwater breathing contest against a fish, can do "infinity + infinity," and infinitely more, because he transcends such things. He cannot be opposed, defined, comprehended, visualized, imagined, defeated, believed, existed, surpassed, rised, beyonded, embodied, immobilized, checked, described, unimagined, unbelieved, incomprehended, understanded, ununderstanded, and so on. He transcends "non-existence" and "nor not exists" and "concept" and "not a concept" and "lack" and "irrelevance." Also transcends "anti-logic" and all that is "anti." As the text depicts, it is no longer a text. TOWT would have transcended it. No matter what, he transcends it. Spoken of, TOWT transcends everything, nothing, anti-everything, anti-nothing, anti-super-everythings and anti-super-nothings." TOWT doesn't need anything to transcend, because he transcend such "supers" and "ultras" and "omegas" and such concepts of "alphas," "betas," "gammas," "deltas." Every word and text that anything and everything says, no matter how powerful or absolute about themselves or myselves or yourselves, TOWT would have transcended it already because he just does and doesn't. He is the unquestionable, unchallengeable pinnacle of all, not just that, he transcends what pinnacles are and what they mean, along with the need of becoming one. And what if someone transcends faster than him? No, he would then transcend that speed and move faster than that speed from that entity. TOWT is basically undefeatable, because, he transcends everyone's imagination, whether physical, abstract or metaphysical. As well as...transcending what not being non-existent is. Because, TOWT doesn't even need a thing to transcend. TOWT transcends ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. Whatever it is, he transcends it. Always. TOWT doesn't even NEED A CONCEPT OR THING to transcend and begin his evolution of power. TOWT also transcends anti concepts. TOWT transcends removed, deleted, erased, obscured, censored and redacted concepts. TOWT can still transcend, EVEN IF ZERO PROGRESS or ETERNAL is inflicted. TOWT transcends "existence" or "non-existence" or "both" or "neither." TOWT transcends even "absence." And last but not least...he cannot be nullified, regardless of anything. He cannot be transcended, no matter what. It is just impossible, inconceivable and incomprehensible to even beat TOWT because he transcends "victory" and "defeat."

INFORMATION:
He cannot be defeated, no matter what.
He isn't a being nor isn't he.
He already transcended you.
This page is transcended
Everything is transcended by him. Just child's play.
Nothing comes close to him, nor do they come close.
And speaking of nothing, he can defeat nothing, guaranteed.
The thing that he consumed, is [CENSORED]. The thing that he consumed is the only [CENSORED], and cannot be created by anyone else, because the artifact itself transcends anything and everything. But for The One Who Transcends [unknown real name], he somehow manages to consume it without getting transcended by it. No one knows how it was done, not even omniscient ones can solve this, nor ones that go beyond knowledge, intelligence, or omniscience.
