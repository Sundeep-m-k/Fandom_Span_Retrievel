A
package particle
is a particle that can be used to carry many different other particles inside. All properties of the particles inside are disabled and stabilized, so they will be safe and secure. This allows civilizations to safely create Primordium X and Primordium Chaos without destroying the entire civilization. This can also be used to make powerful bombs to slay powerful gods. Once, a
Cosmic King
kept an entire
Omniverse
in a package particle to protect it during a war.

You can also use these to extensively make matter if combined with
Computer Particles
. Very complex, but it does do. It's also less efficient, requiring an entire classic matter duplicator to make a multiplicatively growing machine. A more efficient way is a simple extension to the matter duplicator so it duplicates the particle on the output path, redirecting one of them back to the loop, making an exponentially growing machine.
