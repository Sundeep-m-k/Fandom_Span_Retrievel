The
Yura Tarded
is an entity that inhabits the
Xemtaverse
. It is a twisted collection of
Yuraverses
whose space-Fabric is somehow molded together. It constantly is eating
Yuraverses
and
Cosmobubbles
to feed its growing Yura-Factory. The Yura Tarded has many components.

Habitat
Yura-Factory
[
]
This produces the energy for the Yura Tarded. It's a ginormous cavity with a maze of endless tunnels and
Yuraverses
. The inside is full of pipes, spheres and mining equipment to extract energy from the strings of the
Cosmobubbles
. These components, like the rest of the Yura Tarded, is composed of Tardium.
Tardium
[
]
Tardium is a thick black "liquid" of sorts that can take on any form. The Tardium is really a goop of living units, like cells, which contain
Googolversal
Sources, which allow them to create anything for themselves and host a mini
Googolverse
inside. They're tangled up with
Yuraverse
Strings, which allow them to complete complex functions. These units use the strings as instantaneous energy transport between themselves.
The Brain
[
]
Despite its name, the Yura Tarded is extremely intelligent. The Tardium in the Brain forms an interconnected series of
Yuraverse
Strings, which allows them to cooperate and think thoughts orders of magnitude more profound than any
Xemtaverse
-faring civilisation could ever fathom. We are yet to establish communication with the Yura Tarded.
The Outside
[
]
The outside is made of coagulated Tardium, which is extremely condensed Tardium that is extremely difficult to penetrate. The Yura Tarded can create holes where it absorbs Yuraverses to make it grow larger. The Yura Tarded does not excrete anything, and the rest of its insides is made of a loose web of Tardium and Yuraverse String. The Yura Tarded do not possess sight, and we do not know how it can sense its "prey". Inevitably, a Yura Tarded will eat too much and begin to collapse in on itself, or it may die from being too large for energy to be transported, or it may starve, etc. When a Yura Tarded senses it, it will order its Tardium cells to quickly coagulate, splitting itself into 2 Yura Tarded.
Habitat
[
]
The Yura Tarded live on the very edge of the Core of the
Xemtaverse
. They live on the perimeter and eat
Yuraverses
that almost fall in. Many often drift into the Core, and countless Yura Tarded have been found drifting in the Xemtabyss. They are presumed to have died instantly due to glitchiness, otherwise they would have starved by now.
