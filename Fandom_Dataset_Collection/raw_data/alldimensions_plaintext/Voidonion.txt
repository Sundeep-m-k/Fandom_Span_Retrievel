The
Voidonions
are extensions of the
Omnionions
that extend to all skerses below
⊙
0
{\displaystyle \odot_{0}}
, and their size is the lower bound of all
Omnipockets
. They contain mostly objects that are below the -1st
Hyperdimension
, and anything that uses dimensions lower than H(-2) is restricted to the Voidonions. At this low of a level, there are ALMOST no more laws since there does not exist Omnipockets to transfer them across the Voidonion, and objects in the Voidonion must make their own laws to follow.
Notable Layers

Once again, do not change links including numbers to math tags, otherwise it will not be obvious they are links. I totally didn't copy and paste this from Omnionion. "Layer x" will describe

{\displaystyle \odot_{-x}}
so there isn't as many nowikis in the table.
Layer
General description (links, if the layer has one, will have more information)
1
The first and biggest layer of the Voidonions, which contain many
class -2
objects and laws almost do not exist at this low in the hierarchy.
2
At this point containment becomes too complex at this scale to just be something that's predefined and not even
Supercontainment
is an option since it requires containment to define. Objects must define containment themselves if they dare contain OR supercontain anything inside them.
3
Objects must use dimensions from H(-2) to travel between
⊙
−
2
{\displaystyle \odot_{-2}}
and
⊙
−
3
{\displaystyle \odot_{-3}}
. This bounds H(-3) objects to
⊙
−
3
{\displaystyle \odot_{-3}}
and lower.
79
Containment becomes completely alien and too complex for any object to have by themselves, and nothing at this level can contain anything without the help of an extension downwards of Omnipockets called Archpockets.
247
All things are impossible for objects to define at this point, with the exception of Archpockets to distribute laws.
Archpockets
[
]
Archpockets are a downwards extension of Omnipockets that are used in the Voidonion to distribute laws in
⊙
−
79
{\displaystyle \odot_{-79}}
and lower. Their purpose is to prevent the entirety of
⊙
−
247
{\displaystyle \odot_{-247}}
and lower from collapsing into nothingness.
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
Even Unipockets struggle to keep objects stable at this low. The very first glimpses of true
Nothing
show here, however we are very, VERY far away from achieving that.
