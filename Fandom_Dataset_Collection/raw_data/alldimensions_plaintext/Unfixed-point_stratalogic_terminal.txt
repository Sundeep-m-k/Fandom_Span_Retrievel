The importance and value of an unfixed point
[
]
importance
[

To have a fixed point, as described with almost every verse, (example: "there is nothing but void after this" is somewhat quoted a lot on this wiki), is to be something that contains a set of things, and the set of things inside defines it point; but this is an unfixed point, so saying "there is nothing after this" is completely illogical, it does not contain anything, but also does, it just is, and it is the unfixed point that is all.

The fact of being an unfixed point is of extreme priority: if it was not, it would be easily containable, but the fact that it is an unfixed point, makes it undestroyable, and uncontainable, by any method(shape, form, size).

Stratalogic

Stratalogic is a multiverse of any possible outcome/set of rules for a form of logic(paradoxical sentence), this means that there could be a set of logic that is completely different from ours(which there is in the stratalogic), or a form of logic where everything is small, and nothing is large, or where numbers/quantities are reversed, or where being is what it means to exist as nothing, etc, but the stratalogical terminal, creates and has complete control over the stratalogic(paradoxical sentence).
