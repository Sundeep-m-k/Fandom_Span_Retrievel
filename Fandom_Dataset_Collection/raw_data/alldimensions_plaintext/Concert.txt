Concert is a verse that is contained by
Ubrokeit
. It is a giant glass concert which you can reach through a glass portal in a house with the address 2000-5931-Aa38-9382-bbkX-4828x-xpssd-F80F3-40wBB-B5610. Despite it being a concert, literally no sound is made and no sound can be played. It is the only part of
Ubrokeit
that is not transparent, because it just looks like a normal theater. Residents of
Ubrokeit
visit or live here to relax. You can take off the walls to eat, they regenerate afterwards.
