Introduction
[
]
Painful worlds
are made of several
Bloody eyes
and a single
Destructive maw
each.
These are verse-destroying organisms that destroy and absorb many things. Their victims are first destroyed by the Bloody eyes and then devoured by the Destructive maws, while also increasing their power. Even though those structures are dangerous alone, these abominations combining both of them are tens of times scarier and dangerous than what you'd expect. So please:
S T A Y.  T H E.  F U C K.  A W A Y.  F R O M.  T H E M.
Does these things have a gender?

They don't, unless you count "scary" as a gender. What idiot thinks thats a gender?
