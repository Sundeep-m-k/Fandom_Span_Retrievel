A
Clusterverse
is type of verse responsible of containing
Collectionverses
. The amount of Collectionverses inside a Clusterverse can vary drastically, and it mostly depends on their size. Weirdly, the ones with the highest amount of Collectionverses are NOT the largest ones, but instead the average sized ones contain the most Collectionverses.

Basic Structure
[
]
A Clusterverse, although quite common, has a very complicated structure. Getting lost in a Clusterverse is quite easy, and finding your way out is very hard.
A Clusterverse usually contains up to 10 sections. These sections are further divided into at most 100,000,000 "containers", each of which contain up to 100 Collectionverses. Each of these containers can vary in size, and sometimes even intersect with other containers.
There are also a few special containers that don't contain anything, and some containers are so big that their contents can leak into other sections. This makes navigating a Clusterverse extremely hard.
There is also an extremely small chance that a Clusterverse will contain 11 sections, which completely messes up their structure even more.
Types of Clusterverses
[
]
There are at least 3 types of Clusterverses, all which vary from each other.
Normal Clusterverse
[
]
A Normal Clusterverse is the most common type of Clusterverse, with 10 sections and 100,000,000 Collectionverse containers.
11-Section Clusterverse
[
]
11-Section Clusterverses are a lot more rare than Normal Clusterverses, and contain 11 sections instead of the normal 10. 11-Section Clusterverses are more prone to corruption, and are extremely messy inside, with many containers containing nothing and some sections intersecting with other sections.
15-Section Clusterverse
[
]
15-Section Clusterverses are the rarest ones. Theres only one of those registered, and contains 15 sections. Its actually the most stable of all types.
Glitchy Clusterverse
[
]
Glitchy Clusterverses are the rarest of them all, and are basically Clusterverses that are corrupted with either
Glitchonicite
or
Corruptite
. These Clusterverses usually don't have any Collectionverses inside of them because their unstability.
