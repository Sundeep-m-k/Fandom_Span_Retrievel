The name of this article is so
small
that we cant even read it. It perfectly defines this structure with that name, though. If you wonder, it says its the
"infinitesimally small cylinder"
(I.S.C).
A weird fact is that the I.S.Cs, if you look closely, aren't really perfect cylinders, because they have mountain-like bumps on their surface that are 5 million times smaller than the I.S.Cs themselves each. Those bumps are known as
Montoses
, and weirdly, there are more of them INSIDE the I.S.Cs.

Unknown, they're so small we can't even know properly. Plus, something of this size may not even properly have the concept of temperature, let alone have one.
