This verse is another ''object'' verse but this time it is larger and it is a mountain. Many people go to this verse because it is a higher view so they can find stuff.
At the top is snow that is eternal, even though it is hot up there. No one knows why the snow is there. Many people are entertained by the snow however.
The mountain is very steep in most parts, but there are some trails that lead you up there fast in less than 5 hours. Getting up here, however, is much faster than looking for the verse on ground level.
Many people do complain about the snow up there because it apparently makes them go insane. However, it is still a popular place for climbers, and it does help you find your way easierÂ :)
Also, I have been living there my whole life and I am not insane.
