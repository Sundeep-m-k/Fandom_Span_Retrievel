Voidtown
is a town saturated with darkness. The towns are located in atmospheric air bubbles, and we can say that they're some kind of flying islands. They lack a concept of streets, though there is a system of paths through houses in them. The ruler of our local town is a face above the city that consists of two eyes and a smile, being the
god of it
.
The average voidtown has one specially large bulding on them that has roughly 128 floors, with 8 apartments on each one.
These towns are where
darknet's
are located, beings that devour energy from
Final'er Containers
, buying them from the
Warehouses
.
