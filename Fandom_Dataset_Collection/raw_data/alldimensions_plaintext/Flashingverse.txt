Unstability
Very high
A flashingverse is a verse that sometimes flickers out from existence, then turns back on like nothing happened. When this happens, all life, bodies, structures, etc, gets reset and does not exist for the next 4.2 OYC. Due to this flashing, the stability of this verse is very low. This is also the thing this verse is named after. There are many kinds of lifeforms in or were in flashingverses, but most are lost to time.
How does the flashing work?
[
]
The reason that the flashing occurs is from the civilizations failing to meet the quota for energy given to the 3 energy units. These energy unites are what stops the flashingverse from imploding. The average for the quota for energy is 1.24x10
13
Joules
. This causes the energy units to turn off, causing the universe to implode in an average of 0.21 milliseconds.
Currency
[
]
There is a common currency across the flashingverse named "cofni", or ▀c▄ for short. The name cofni is named after Delamoucan Cofnised, the creator of the True Bank, where most ▀c▄ is made. 1▀c▄ is worth $1.28 USD. There also is a smaller currency, called the cofnid, worth a two-hundredth of a cofni, or 0.64¢. The symbol for a cofnid is |▀cd▄|
Known civilizations
[
]
There were many civilizations, but most's logs from the dust of memories got removed sometimes. These are a few that were not removed.
Hint: █ means an unknown character of a message.
Wgds
[
]
Wgds were a civilization that is based off wingdings. They had a kardashev scale of 0.85. They were also known for their revolutionary technologies, like the one below, and the forever lasting Wg's penitentiary.

Lumians
[
]
Lumians were a civilization that didn't get so lucky on technology. And from that, they had a kardashev scale of 0.2. They were still able to make a conveyor system that goes to a local transmitter. There is no log of their language or history found yet.
Gitzerflacians
[
]
Gitzerflacians were a civilization that made most technologies in the devices that are used in the flashingverse. They were able to make so advanced technology from their surplus of spare energy from their planet and their intellect. They had a kardashev scale of 1.1 to add to that.
Buildings
[
]
Gitzerflacians were also amazing architects, able to make buildings taller than what was thought possible with the power of magnetism. They used it to make the upper floors levitate, making there be less stress on the lower floors. There are multiple building that are known.
The True Bank: 81█ floors (Forever lasting)
Cloud s█ock: 9█6 floors
B█rl's tipp█r: 1,243 floors
P█ris Hotel: 1,3██ floors (Forever lasting)
Rules
[
]
There are a few rules in a flashingverse - that if not followed, will send you to one of 7 layers of prison. Or just get a fine.
Minor
Supply at least 100,000 joules to the energy core. (Fine: 100▀c▄, no energy brought until paid.)
Do not use any life-form's devices to make energy. (Only able to use 1,000,000-(Energy taken in Joules) Joules in that hundredth of an OYC.)
Do not replicate ▀c▄. (Has to pay the amount of ▀c▄ produced without using the produced ▀c▄.)
Macro
Do not abuse the power of stick mirrors without a licence. (Go to light prison for half of an OYC)
Do not try to steal ▀c▄ from anything. (Give all of the ▀c▄ taken back to the thing that had the ▀c▄ and go to prison for a quarter OYC.) (Can be major if big enough.)
Do not try to escape prison. (If caught, will go back to the same level of prison for an extra half OYC)
Major
Do not try to steal ▀c▄ from anything. (10,000+) (Same as micro, but the sentence is 3 OYC in heavy prison.)
Do not try to vandalize the energy units (Go to heavier prison for 2 OYC)
Prison
[
]
There are 7 layers of prison, each more secure that the next. You can go here by doing a Macro or Major crime. There is a small description of them all below.
Classes of prison
Type of prison
Description
Number of people
Lightest Prison
This is like a normal hotel room, except you can't leave.
185 Trillion
Lighter Prison
A very poor quality living room, there is a lot of trash around.
97.3 Trillion
Light Prison
A normal cell, but there is a very small amount of comfort.
243 Trillion
Prison
A normal cell, no comfort except a blanket to sleep on the floor with.
1.2 Quadrillion
Heavy Prison
A room that has solid graphene doors, that are stuck together by 16 rods of unknown material. These can only be opened by a guard, there are still windows made of explosion-proof glass.
342 Trillion
Heavier Prison
There are 16 instakill bars at the doors and windows that can't be reverted. There also is just a hole for a toilet. Combined with the instakill bars, there also is a force-field across the bars.
30.2 Trillion
Heaviest Prison
A solid indestructible room, even supernova proof, with instakill walls and emptiness. If you are trying to starve yourself to death. You get force fed the worst food imaginable.
2.9 Trillion
Structures
[
]
There are a few objects that are in every flashingverse. This is a list of them.
Stick mirrors
[
]
The structure of a stick mirror.
Stick mirrors are the main sources of light in a flashingverse. They make light by reflecting distant background light and amplifying it then shining it out. There are around 1 quadrillion stick mirrors in a flashingverse. They also explode into their amplification cells when they run out of energy. These are able to get controlled, but it is illegal without a licence.
Wg's penitentiary
[
]
A basic map of floor 416, section 1923. (Click to see better)
Wg's penitentiary is a 7X0 floor prison from the Wgds that contains almost 25% of the prisoners in a flashingverse. Every 1XX floors contains a different layer of prison. There are also around 300 quadrillion guards to patrol any escapees. Each floor is around 1 billion square kilometres in area.
P█ris Hotel
[
]
A side hub of the hotel.
The P█ris Hotel is a 13XX floor hotel that contains the most famous people of that flash. Each room being filled with luxury. There are 26 sections that are more luxurious at you go up, the 26th section being fully plated with the most rare thing within 1.5 light years. There are around 3.42 quadrillion staff and can fit up to 10 quintillion people.
True Bank
[
]
A picture of the True Bank.
The True Bank is a bank that make most of the ▀c▄ in a flashingverse. This was made by Delamoucan Cofnised, which was what ▀c▄ was named after. Each floor has 2 sides. A print side, and a mint side. The print side is for making notes that have 8 different values of worth. The mint side makes the coins, with 8 different values like the ▀c▄. The True Bank also has 81X floors.
