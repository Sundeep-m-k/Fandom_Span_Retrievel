. They accellerate galaxies placed inside them to speeds that allow them to get all the way through them in just a few seconds. this accelleration can be increased seven thousand fold by feeding the projectile galaxy into another SÅ«Å«ko immediately afterwards. You can keep doing this without any limitations, and these are commonly used as free and easy transportation throughout

SÅ«Å«ko wraps time around itself in a torus-like manifold, meaning that they trap an object's time in a loop, letting itself exist longer in the process. SÅ«Å«ko can bring the time it absorbs back in time to before it existed, allowing it to exist at that point in time. This means that SÅ«Å«ko exists at all points in time, and to

, it is like a background part of the animation, which is there throughout the entire thing. SÅ«Å«kos are commonly transported to our

by infinitely more energy-intensive but faster moving bodies that are usually hand-created. Although their number one use is for transportation, many have attempted to harvest them for energy, but none have suceeded
SÅ«Å«ko is actually nearly invincible due to bending time in a way that allows them to exist at every moment. this means that they are ideal for making capital buildings out of or sheilding capital buildings with, as they also cover transportation needs. Cosmic entities have even taken to wearing it as armor. SÅ«Å«ko is actually very valuable and are about worth a quarter their weight in
