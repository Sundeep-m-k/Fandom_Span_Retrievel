About
[
]
The
Boxial
Voids
are the birthplace of tons of
Boxes
, and also where all the per-layer
Boxial Cores
can be found. Due to direct access to each Boxial layer, direct access to the Boxial Voids can serve as a travel hub.

Ironically, Boxial Voids are NOT
Boxes
themselves.
Existence Rank
[
]
The Boxial Voids have a transfinite
Existence Rank
, resulting in a large presence of Order and Chaos, with Order taking priority at a macroscale and Chaos at a microscale. These components are essential for
verse
formation (microchaos is needed for energy, marcoorder is needed for laws), resulting in Boxial Voids being rich with
Archverses
and Sub-Boxes.
Sub-Boxes
[
]
As described in the Boxial Core's page, most Boxes started as a sea of Sub-Boxes. These Sub-Boxes formed by the Boxial Voids' natural redistribution of space end up leading to pockets of nothingness getting grouped with eachother. These pockets become packed with containment, causing Existence Ranks to lower and stabilize via lesser density (more space).
This will either form an Archverse, stay empty, or continue in a timeline similar to a Boxial Core's formation.
