Motivations
To be the best law manipulator.
The Law Manipulators are a race of people that each have their own House that their only ruler, The Omegayor, created to be able to not be destroyed by the Omega-Laws.  Each Law Manipulator has their own house and computer where they keep the Omega-Laws in balance, each house having a different variation of The Higher Lands.  They are constantly trying to outbest eachother, except for, sadly, our local Law Manipulator; Rick.  He is constantly trying to bend the rules and Omega-Laws and make everyone in his computer screen suffer.  For this, The Omegayor sentenced him to an entire 2 Lawdays in The Captured Pit.  The most powerful law manipulator is likely Jim, who has had 0 slip ups in his entire Life.  He is currently the head law manipulator and is 2nd in command to The Omegayor, who promoted him to head law manipulator.  He has the power to create his own Houses and can even go outside of The Town Barrier.
