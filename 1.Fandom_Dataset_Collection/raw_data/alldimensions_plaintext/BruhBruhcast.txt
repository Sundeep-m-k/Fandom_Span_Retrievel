History

BruhBruhcast was created by an entity whose name is unknown. However, we do know how many letters it has (****** ******). He made BruhBruhcast as a bruh weather bruhcast. However, as there were a lot of bruh weather (bruhnados, bruhfires, bruhquakes etc.), BruhBruhcast expanded, having more and more volunteers and also broadcasting bruh news such as the discovery of Shrek's bruh swamp. Shortly after, BruhBruhcast went universal after striking an illicit deal with some
Omni-God
s. After reaching quantum levels, BruhBruhcast created
the Black Hole Regulator
