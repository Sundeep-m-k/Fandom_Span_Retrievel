The verse of ultimate paradoxes is a verse that has 2 properties that cause paradoxes together. These 2 properties is that if the size is positive, it's size is negative and if the size is negative, it's size is positive. This creates insane paradoxes, in which it's size is positive and negative at the same time, and it can't be Zero because Zero is neither positive or negative, so we need the opposite of zero, in terms of positivity and negativity. These things are found literally everywhere beyond the
Ring System of Eternity
, feel free to add more examples of it's paradoxes.
