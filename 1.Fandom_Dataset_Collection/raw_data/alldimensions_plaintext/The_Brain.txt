The Brain is what controls the
Destructionverse
. Its contents are completely unknown, although the reasons behind its destructive thoughts are due to the influence of
The Destroyer
. The Brain automatically detects anything that enters the
Destructionverse
, and such object is instantly obliterated, in less than a Planck time. Due to this, all attempts to destroy or damage The Brain have failed. Although god has the power to destroy it, he has not yet done so for unknown reasons. In the meantime, The Brain continues to take part in destruction through controlling the
Destructionverse
.
