An
Impossible Object
is
just
that
, an object that has one or more properties which are
impossible
.
Although fitting, this definition is not exactly accurate, since the definition of "
impossible
" depends upon the laws of reality/physics in a
specific
universe
or
multiverse
(or higher).
Usually, impossible objects are
forbidden
from existence in just
multiverses
, with some going as far as
omniverses
.
