The Paradoxverse is the best example of a paradox ever. It contains itself an infinite amount of times, but not in the same way as
The Box
because The Box contains multiple duplicates of itself, but the Paradoxverse contains itself in a way that its only one in the entire void. It is positioned in the
Yellowmarkersverse
, but it still contains itself an infinite amount of times.
