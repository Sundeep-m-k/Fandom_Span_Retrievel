A
Lim
is a coordinate in liminal space.
Thus a -
n
{\displaystyle n}
liminal object is one that needs at minimum
n coordinates to specify a point anywhere in it.
Liminal Spaces are also sometimes referred to as Limspaces.
Reality
has an absolutely infinite amount of
lims
and for all intents and purposes, such as
The Backrooms
. It is
more than enough
for anything and everything to exist within its own right. Anything inaccessible through the concepts of lims is not considered part of this Reality, and neither is it a part of the
other-Realmy
.
Life
CAN
exist within Lims, although they are unlike any ordinary lifeforms. They dwell between spaces and are known as the
In-betweeners
.
