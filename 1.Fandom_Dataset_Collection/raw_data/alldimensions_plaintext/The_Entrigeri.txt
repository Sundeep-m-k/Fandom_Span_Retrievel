OYC. They are now virtually extinct, with there only being 4 known Entrigeri left. They include a
Light Tribe
member (that joined when they first found
Zoid
), The Seller, the owner of
The Store
, a mutated Entrigeri running
The Supply Store
, and
The Warrior
. The Entrigeri seem to be immune to corrosive and toxic elements such as
Toxicium
, and a few Entrigeri have strange powers.

A depiction of an Entrigeri
The Entrigeri have a humanoid appearance, with their faces being almost featureless, except for a few slits close to the bottom for speaking. They have 2 arms with 2 fingers on each of them. These 2 fingers have 5 fingers branching off of them. Each of their 2 feet have 4 toes.
Entrigeri, even though they do not have eyes, have very good hearing and are good at sensing objects around them. They have used this to somehow create their own language even though they are blind.
Life Cycle
[
]
The Entrigeri have been seen to be able to live for insane amounts of time, as shown with The Seller. They have a relatively simple life cycle.
Birth
[
]
Entrigeri are created from wormholes formed by at least 4 older Entrigeri which manipulate matter in such a way that it can create a living creature. Entrigeri in this state are very small, with them only being a few centimeters tall. They will continue to grow exponentially for the next few days until they are approximately 1.2 meters.
Development Stage
[
]
After about 5 days, Entrigeri will develop a few slits at the bottom of their lower face, allowing them to be able to speak. During this this period, their brains will rapidly develop. This is also the stage where they are most vulnerable, as a small disturbance to them can cause their brain functions to slow, making them easier targets for predators.
Main Stage
[
]
This is when Entrigeri are fully developed. The slits at the bottom of their faces will slowly start to shrink over this period due to them getting older. Entrigeri will created around 2 or 3 new Entrigeri during this stage. At around 10,000 years, their ability to talk will be gone due to the slits fully closing.
Old Stage
[
]
An Entrigeri enters this stage after the slits at the bottom of their mouths fully close, making then unable to speak. An Entrigeri's metabolism will also begin to slow down, and they will start to lose brain functions over time. Entrigeri can last thousands, or even millions of OYC in this stage if left alone, but are extremely vulnerable against outside threats, such as other creatures, viruses, or foreign material.
Relationship with
The Store
[
]
The Entrigeri are thought to have constructed the pocket dimension which contains The Store and The Store itself as a safe haven from outside threats. Evidence suggests that The Store was a trading hub of sorts for the Entrigeri inside the pocket dimension. All the items present inside The Store seems to point to a relatively advanced Entrigeri civilization before they got wiped out.
The Entrigeri also created Vpom (The Entrigeri currency) sometime before The Store was created.
Language
[
]
The Entrigeri language, known as
Entrigerish
, is an alphabet, and has 27 letters. Strangely enough, the Entrigeri language shares many similarities to
Puffish
, making many believe that the Entrigeri are related to the Primordialverse and the
Primordial Entities
in some way or another. Not all Entrigeri texts are written with this language, as shown in
The new Entrigeri language (Post-Store times)
the books able to be bought at The Store. There are 2 variations of the language, with the newer one shown at the top and the older one shown at the bottom.

The Entrigeri manage to find
Zoid
, where they might have copied the
Puffish
language. The language evolves over time and develops into the Old Entrigeri language, which is used all the way until they create
The Store
. An Entrigeri joins

The Entrigeri find a small verse known as

and stay there for some time. Many new things have been discovered and created by The Entrigeri, including some of the earliest plasma weapons and Vpom, The Entrigeri currency.

The first non-Entrigeri creature finds The Store and buys something.

A strange entity which refers to itself as an Entrigeri create a building very similar to The Store, known as
The Supply Store
. This Entrigeri was later found out to be a mutated form of a regular Entrigeri.
