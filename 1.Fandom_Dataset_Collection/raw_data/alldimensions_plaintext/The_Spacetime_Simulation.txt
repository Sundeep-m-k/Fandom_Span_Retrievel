The
Spacetime simulation
is the theory that everything is in a simulation. There are multiple layers to it.

Layer 0
[
]
Layer 0 of this simulation is the
Universe
.  The universe represents a singular 1 or 0 in a byte of code.  The universe is the reason that all layers above exist.
Layer 1
[
]
Layer 1 of this simulation is the
Omniverse
, which represents a singular byte of code.  The omniverse is the reason that all layers above exist.
Layer 2
[
]
Layer 2 of this simulation is
The Box
, which represents a singular line of code.  The box is the reason that all layers above exist.
Layer 3
[
]
Layer 3 of this simulation is the
Uniperaverse
, which represents a singular website.  Said website can vary in size very drastically, such as having a singular letter on it or being the biggest website on the entire internet.  The uniperaverse is the reason that layer 4 exists.
Layer 4
[
]
Layer 4 of this simulation is the
The Drum
, which represents a website with multiple website links on them, i.e wikipedia, wikia/fandom, etc.  The drum is the reason that layer 5 exists.
Layer 5
[
]
Layer 5 of this simulation is
The Never-Ending Void of Darkness
and represents all websites on the internet.  The never ending void of darkness is the reason that layer 6 exists.
Layer 6
[
]
Layer 6 of this simulation is
The Hyper Flower
, and represents all data on the internet.  Unlike the other layers, this one doesn't really contribute to other layers, it's just the combination of all the below ones.
Layer 7
[
]
Layer 7 of this simulation is
Existency
, and represents the background of your computer.  Also doesn't really contribute.
Layer 8
[
]
Layer 8 of this simulation is
The Clockwork
, which represents all the functions in the computer like turning on, turning off, alt f4, etc., and each function is a distinct clockwork.  This layer is probably the most important layer and makes up the last layer.
Layer 9
[
]
Layer 9 is the final layer of this situation, and represents the spacetime simulation.  This represents the computer itself and is the reason that the data exists in the first place.
