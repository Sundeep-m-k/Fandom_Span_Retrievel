"Keet jedienski daae"
Ine, transliterated from Iorian "I win and lose"
Representation of Ine, "The Deified" by Eric Calzeman
Ine (pronouns: ine/ier) is a god that somehow loses and wins at the same time, due to a pretty advanced supercomputer built by the Aprochians right in ier "subconscious" area of ier mind, The supercomputer has the power to clone themselves and the opponent and the aforementioned supercomputer can do much more than duplicate. Ier can do very advanced equations, simulate life on Earth's future, and even forecast tropical cyclone activity on any planet and still get the CORRECT results, as proven by Aprochian scientists Pēbeeæs Enbēæ (pronounced PBS NBA) and Fřb Flețř (pronounced Ferb Fletcher). Ier ages exponentially, although ier is 2717 OYC old, it is 2.6e+9130 OYC old by Ine standards. Ine speaks Iorian.
History
[
]
2717
OYC
ago, ier was supposedly "born" by Iorian parents named Ytngawed (Yiþengard by others) and Irndoexyle (Imdōsile by locals, locals failed to realize the m was actually rn.). 717 OYC later, ier encountered
Stella Nova
. She was friendly enough to give Ine superpowers, like withstanding
toxicium
and
glitchchonicite
. 1 OYC later, ier got a diploma at Ionian God School and granted a god. Ier was given 1000
mu megastingers
in return, and created a universe called Ikreverse. It is 1999 OYC old, so expect future development. It was before an average Ionian, now a god that can withstand shockwaves, extreme temperatures, and even
crabs
.
