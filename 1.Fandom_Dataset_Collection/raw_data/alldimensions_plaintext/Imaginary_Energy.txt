Imaginary Energy is a interversal substance which can mostly be used by civilizations. Due to being
multiversal
/
archversal
, it is made of
hyperatomic
plasma, in which all elements are
biradioactive
.
When dark energy enters a universe, Imaginary Energy exits the universe and becomes a multiversal energy source, like how energies are generated at the borders of a
Universe
. Imaginary Energy becomes a
Proto-Xenoverse
if it exits a
Superverse
, due to how
Xenoverses
are formed.
Imaginary Energy is made of virtual boson-like particles, which can used in many ways, like alloying Interuniversal metals, forming
Imaginary Polyhedrons
, keeping interuniversal forces that come from bosons, and using it as a power source for most Imaginary Polyhedrons.
Unlike other bosons, Imaginary Energy can have colors if its density is really high, like
Cosmic Clouds
.

Interuniversal
[

Dense Imaginary Energy can become interuniversal-type, and also form a primordial cloud. Forces can pass through this type of Imaginary Energy, which then gets stored inside of the cloud to be released a later time. After an extremely long amount of time, these clouds become
Imaginary Cubes
.
At a really high density of interuniversal forces, Imaginary Energy acquires an anomaly where lightning-like strikes appear out of nowhere. Material on one side of the strike gets attracted towards it, while material on the other side gets repelled. If one of these highly dense clouds enters a universe, its sudden transformation into Dark Energy would cause a Big Rip scenario, which is a XK-Class Universe Destruction scenario.

Protoscopic
[
]
So far there is only one recorded protoscopic-scale usage of Imaginary Energy, and that is Imaginary Energy allowing
Micropeanut
to move faster than light.
Universal
[
]
When Imaginary Energy enters a
Universe
, it will decay into Dark Energy, with all matching bosons being emitted out, including the exotic ones, like gravitons and accelerons.
However, if a photon hits Imaginary Energy when it passes into a universe, it will become an electron instead of dark energy, due to having electric charge by a strange phenomenon of dark energy.
Interuniversal Imaginary Energy can hold more interuniversal forces, and can survive longer on its own in Universes.

Imaginary Energy is a product for alloying interuniversal metals. 1 kg of this alloy can be formed by mixing with 500 g of
Cosmic Clouds
, 200 g of
biradioactive hyperatoms
, and 300 g of Imaginary Energy. Interuniversal metals are unstable in
Universes
, but last longer inside than Imaginary Energy alone. The most efficient way of doing so is to use Interuniversal Imaginary Energy, which is the most stable kind.
Imaginary Energy can be conserved with an
Imaginarium Wire
, which consists of a single kind of Interuniversal metal that must be superconductive. These wires are often used to connect
Imaginary Polyhedrons
with others.
Imaginary Energy is a power generator of
Imaginary Tetrahedrons
, as universes are held in the center, where momentum can be converted into Imaginary Energy by the surface forces. However, due to strong forces, it should be powered up by Interuniversal Imaginary Energy.
Imaginary Energy is often blended together in
Imaginary Cubes
, which are Imaginary Polyhedrons used for blending different kinds of Imaginary Energy in a very efficient way. When infrastructure supports are installed, it can be contained in a smaller Imaginary Cube, where it is a bit more dangerous due to the higher density.
Imaginary Energy can be moved freely through a network of
Imaginary Octahedrons
. And finally, Imaginary Energy can be used as a battery inside
Imaginary Icosahedrons
, just to stop
Cosmic Clouds
, although a really high amount of
Cosmic Clouds
can become new Universes.
