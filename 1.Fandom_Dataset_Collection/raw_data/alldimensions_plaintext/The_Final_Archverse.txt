The
Final Archverse
is a verse that contains
Final Multiverses
and other verses of similar properties to the
Archverses
. Just like how The Final Multiverse looks very similar to a normal
Multiverse
, for each Archverse there is a verse extremely similar to it, in fact an infinite number of each (including the
Omniverse
). The actual structure of The Final Archverse does not actually look like any known Archverse, almost looking like a random noise of verses.
Structure
[
]
The structure of The Final Archverse is not
all
noise, however. When observed closer, the smaller verses are usually split into 3 portions:
Packing: Many of the Final Archverse's archverses are packed closely together, forming a dense combination of these verses.
Fractal: These portions form a fern fractal sort of shape of specific verses, all interlinked together to form strange and interesting structures.
Tubes: Here is a structure similar to the packing structure,
however
, it has many long tube-shaped holes interweaving through The Final Archverse.
