The Bad language
is, like the name suggests, really bad. It was created by a bunch of idiots, but it only got popular because
Bob
promoted it to the interversal public for some unknown reason. It used to have the name "HDGFVGDFSASFGHGFVD" due to it being created by idiots, but Bob changed the name upon promoting it because of how bad he thought it was. Now, Bad language is the name used today, and it is almost never referred to as "HDGFVGDFSASFGHGFVD".
This language uses the same characters as the English alphabet, along with another one, μ.

Literally every other word in this language is undecided, due to how bad it is. So, that's it. No one has any idea why Bob promoted this language.
