Versemegas
(also known as Microverses) are a strange type of verse found in
Versemultis
, so it can be considered as a negative equivalent of a
Megaverse
. They are mostly scattered around their local Versemulti with nothing else except a few rogue
Versegigas
and their local Versemulti's core. Unlike their container, Versemegas are dense verses. They contain about 840 versegigas that are all usually packed row-by-row, and they have a
Voidity
of about 13%. Large versemegas are also known to contain at least 2 or 3 smaller versemegas near the center, so they qualify as Berryverses.
Habitation
[
]
Versemegas are known to be paraterraformable for many types of negative-sized entities (although the only negative entities are
Scalene
,
Qsheuf
, and their colleagues). Airtight icosahedral structures are often used as habitations to shield entities from radiation. On average, about 65536 entities will live inside a Versemega. This has also recently lead to simulations of Versemegas (the
Versemetas
) being constructed.
