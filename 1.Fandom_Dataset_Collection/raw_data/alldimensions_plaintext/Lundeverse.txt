The
Lundeverse
, also known as the Octonionverse, is a verse within the
Primordialverse
which has octonion dimensions and size. Being even more unknown than even the
Katoverse
, it is indescribable and unimaginable and wouldn’t be able to be comprehended even by any would-be life in the Katoverse. Although it is completely impossible to enter today, and will not be for several thousand
OYC
[

]
, it is thought to be incredibly dangerous, even more so than the Katoverse, so entering it would do nothing.
In a ~28.2 septillion ly area surrounding the Lundeverse, it is very glitchy, even more so than
Glitchonicite
, and gets glitchier, until you disappear entirely. Certain parts of the area can be turned into ‘safe zones’, which are ‘less’ glitchy (although still very glitchy).
