The
Verseomnis
are the smallest possible unit that can exist in
the String Theory++
, and it attracts all objects with an
Existence Rank
of 1/2 to it. In this sense, it can be thought of as the polar opposite of an
Omniverse
. Before
Versemetas
were constructed, these objects were directly contained by
Verseultras
. However, the Verseomnis slowly dispersed into
Versehypers
instead and absorbed their simulation aspect. This makes it the connection point of the simulated and real
Verseunis
.
Properties
[
]
Verseomnis are very unstable. It ejects fourteen
ƨǝxoꓭ
every
asyncawaitsecond
. This makes them very uninhabitable.
