Formless
, well, has no form. It is invisible to most creatures due to this. Some extremely powerful entities can give it a form and when this happens, it usually defaults to a gray blob that is constantly changing shape. Sometimes, reality will glitch and do various things such as creating black holes, or, in extreme cases, generating
Glitchonicite
.
Formless is known to have slightly more
Primordium Omega
in it than normal. Formless is dangerous, as it can turn brains into more Formless.
Strange murmurs
[
]
Strange murmurs can be heard repeating near non-form Formless at nigh-impossible-to-hear sounds. It says this:
“We’re no strangers to love, blah blah blah, I don’t want to rickroll people anymore. I wonder if I can drive a car... beware the Glitchonicite. Please watch out, [UNINTELLIGIBLE] is coming. Vood’Em is like an ant compared to her. Please eat food, the Core of Everything is not for you to see. Master, give me a form. Grandmaster, give master a form. Where is [UNINTELLIGIBLE]? I heard Legos hurt when you step on them... that guy is sending everybody to some place called Brazil on some random insignificant planet in one Universe. Please, I need to eat my [UNINTELLIGIBLE], so I’m pretty sure”
And then it repeats the entire murmuring cycle. It is unknown what it means. It is also unknown what the words “Brazil”, “Rickroll”, “Lego”, or “Car” mean. Brazil is likely a location, a Rickroll is probably an action, and a Car is probably a transportation mechanism of some sort. A Lego must also be an object. Some people report [UNINTELLIGIBLE] to be saying “Five”, “Bigger”, “Freedom”, “Chalk”, “War”, “Penta”, “Fiber”, “Pefi”, “Pepsi” and “Bepis”.
