The
Icosadakonic Meicosahendon
is a verse shaped like an extremely complex polyhendon (12D shape, even if the verse's actual dimensionality is much higher). It has an uncountably infinite number of
Green Pentatopic Duetriacontahedrons
in it, and contains 4 types of objects constructed from them, being shaped like:
Dodecahedrons
Tetrahedrons
Triangular prisms
And finally, pentagonal prisms.
Properties
[
]
The Icosadakonic Meicosahendon has four different objects, and in this case, four different colors. Each, although constructed from Green Pentatopic Duetricontaterons, actually have extremely similar properties to the
Primordium Particles
.
Tetrahedrons correspond to
Primordium Delta
, also being the rarest of the objects found in The Icosadakonic Meicosahendon.
Dodecahedrons correspond to
Primordium Alpha
,
Triangular prisms correspond to
Primordium Omega
,
and finally,
Primordium Sigma
corresponds to the pentagonal prisms.
It should be noted that these two things are not the same as a large-scale Primordium Particle, but just that they have some similar properties to them.
