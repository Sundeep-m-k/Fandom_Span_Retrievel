The
Absolute Balance
(sometimes abbreviated to TAB) is a verse that allows for balance, or tries to make everything as close to a certain concept, of things that are composed of it. If that didn't make any sense, here's some examples of what would happen to some hypothetical verses that it could be contained by:
If the verse is green it will form an object that is as green as it can be (at least as green as the laws in the verse it is contained by allows).
If the verse is a
cube
it will form an object that is as 'cubelike' as it can be.
If the verse is reflective it will try to be as reflective as it can be.
And the pattern follows, so that anything that it is it will try to go to its extreme.
TABs are almost always found within
Absolute Octahedrons
.
Other Properties
[
]
On its own, The Absolute Balance is a single shade of white or green, being formed from
The Absolute Dark
. However, when it forms into a separate verse, it adapts to its neighbors and tries to be exactly the same as those. If all other TABs are green or white, it will be the first verse that will allow it to share all properties with the rest of it, making a chain reaction with all of the other verses. This is usually called the 'balancing reaction' and the reason why it exists is unknown.
