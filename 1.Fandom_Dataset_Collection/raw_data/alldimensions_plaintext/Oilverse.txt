oil
The
Oilverse
is a verse located somewhere in our
Omniverse
. It contains an immense amount of oil. It is always filled to the brim with oil particles, and when you take out oil, that gap gets filled up. This means the Oilverse has an infinite quantity of oil.
The property
[
]
The Oilverse has the ability to clone molecules. This allows the Oilverse to have infinite oil in it. This is due to the molecules actually splitting, and then they turn to the correct sizes due to the laws of physics. Therefore, the Oilverse clones molecules.
Modules
[
]
The oil forms modules inside the Oilverse. This is because the Oilverse is not regular, and the oil in it needs to find the correct space. Because of the splitting property, there are some "gaps" between the oil modules, which are just the molecules being separate from each other.
