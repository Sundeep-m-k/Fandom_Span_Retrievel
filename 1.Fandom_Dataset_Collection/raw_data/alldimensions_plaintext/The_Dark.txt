The
Dark
is a very dangerous and desolate void, which contains many extreme forms of nothingness, sometimes even getting close to
Absolute Nothing
. This verse is also known as the "mainland" of the
Barrel Container
. This void is so empty that any object inside it decreases its
Existence Rank
by 1 every nanosecond, eventually going so low into an existence rank that it is completely isolated from other structures.
That is, if it doesn't get erased within a
Voidsecond
.
The air, or lack of it, or really a lack of
anything,
is beyond freezing, clocking in at -ω^ω degrees.
Its properties, and the sheer size of this void, make it one of the most dangerous structures in
The Box
.
Many civilizations spent hundreds of
OYC
trying to escape this void, and most attempts ended in the death of the explorers. It wasn't until civilizations created wormhole technology advanced enough to pass this void that larger structures could be explored, allowing more powerful civilizations.
