No is all the hardest verses on hard mode. It has very harsh conditions. In some places there's a giant void that goes on forever so you need to walk around that forever to get past it. It also has no defined dimensionality, so walking around in it is nearly impossible. There are also storms that happen frequently that instantly obliterate
Blueprint Particles
. The only explanation for the storms is that they're made of
Redprint Particles
. This verse also has no defined
Existence Rank
, similar to its dimensionality, so there's that too. There are also completely invisible black holes that appear out of nowhere, and they instantly glitch you out of reality. There also have been sightings of strange "monsters" lurking in No. These "monsters" will gladly kill you. If that isn't hard enough, you'll probably _ out of reality as soon as you enter. Nobody has made it out of No alive. There is 1 safe spot where The Final Verse is kept in, but it's impossible to enter that safe spot, as you instantly get teleported out and glitched out of realty whenever you get close to it. This page also doesn't show up in the recently edited pages.
