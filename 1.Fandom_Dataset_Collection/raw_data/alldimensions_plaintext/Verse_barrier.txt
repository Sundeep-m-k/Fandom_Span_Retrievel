Verse barriers mark the edge of a verse. They are not the same as dimensional barriers (as mentioned in
Ruptureverse
), as they are all-dimensional and none-dimensional and everything in-between. They are hard to escape; but teleportation or a very strong force can work.

Nobody lives on them... usually.
They are partially connected to dimensional barriers, as if one of them is destroyed, the other suffers permanant damage.
If it’s destroyed, the verse is likely to sustain irreperable damages, or at least, it’s contents will be spilled into space. Some verses have no barrier, and others have different barriers.
The mines of slavery
don’t have a barrier, they have more mines.
The
Crustacianverse
