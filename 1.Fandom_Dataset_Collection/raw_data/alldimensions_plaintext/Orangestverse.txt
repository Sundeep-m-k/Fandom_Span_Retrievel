The Orangestverse is a verse that is the essence and embodiment of the color orange, containing googological amounts of
Orangerverses
and oranges. It is the third and final verse in the orange chain. This verse is so orange that instead of the text being orange on its own, the background of the text is also a shade of orange. The atmosphere in here is 99.9912% Orangen and 0.0088% Orangine, with the orange core at the center. All links to this verse must be in this "orangest" text if possible. Any and ALL attempts to change the color of the orangestverse WILL fail. EVERYTHING here is orange even down to the elementary level. But not just the elementary level, as subatomic particles and negative sized particles are still somehow orange.
The Orange Scale
[
]
The Orange Scale is a linear measurement of "orangeness," or how orange a color is. 0 would be not at all orange, and 100 would be a standard orange. Normally something can't go past a 100 on the scale, however objects from the Orangeverse chain can surpass a 100. The scale goes up to an arbitrary value called the Large Orangevalue, equal to what the color of the orange core is on the scale. Most objects considered "oranger" score a 15,000 or up on the scale. Orangestium also has its special value on the orange scale, which is the Small Orangevalue.

Orangen
===
Orangen is a deep orange color in all states of matter. In its gaseous form, it shouldn't be inhaled and smells like oranges. Inhalation may cause permanent monochromatic colorblindness shifted into orange color. If cooled to the freezing point of water (0 degrees Celsius), it condenses into a liquid. In this state, it can be consumed with the taste of orange Fanta. However, it slowly turns any matter that touches it into the same deep orange color, however retaining all other properties including transparency. Even after ALL liquid Orangen has been cleaned off, the matter will remain the orange color. However, it slowly fades back into the original color, and after at maximum 1 hour, the orange color has completely faded. At temperatures -64 degrees Celsius, it freezes in perfectly spherical balls, resembling oranges. These balls can be cut afterwards as long as the temperature consistently remains at most -64 C. All these side effects do not affect Orangeversians, as they were orange and could only see orange to begin with. It also has a different form called Orangite. Orangite can be differentiated from Orangen because Orangite glows, while Orangen doesn't. There are also different forms of Orangen that exist in all states of matter. Examples of this include Orangeren, which is oranger than normal Orangen, and Orangen Minus, which is less orange than Orangen. Unfortunately, Orangen Minus cannot exist in the Orangestverse, as it scores less than a 100 on the Orange Scale.
Orangestium
[
]
Orangestium is a material that is the result of orange energy being compressed into a space of size 0. Orange energy will be explained in the Orange Core section. Compressing the orange energy will create an orangest hole. It turns anything that passes through it orange, but still decays. Once it fully decays, a super rare material will be left behind, called Orangestium. It is the 2nd orangest thing that exists in the 1st
Everything Layer
, possibly in ALL everything layers. The only thing oranger than it is the orange core. It is currently very expensive in Alphasmial Markets, being more expensive than Orangite.
Orangine
[
]
Orangine is an orange colored, orange smelling, and orange tasting gas that will turn anything it touches orange. If it is converted to a solid form, it turns into Orangen. Once inhaled, it will rewire the brain to stop the visual cortex from processing any color other than orange, and change the retina to only see orange colored stuff. Anything with a color different from orange, will, to someone who has inhaled orangine, appear to be orange, and this gas also rewires your whole brain to not understand a color other than orange. It makes the concept of anything other than orange impossible, and it also makes it so if you inhale anything other than orangine or the other materials on this page, you will die because it changes your lungs to stop needing whatever (oxygen, methane, co2, etc.) but instead need orangine. If converted into a liquid and drank, it will cause you to stop needing to drink water or pump blood, but to need to drink orange substances such as orange juice, liquid Orangen, or liquid Orangine as examples, and also pump orangine, which makes no sense but somehow works. Other lifeforms which are very different to normal lifeforms we have discovered so far will have similar effects, but to different things which they have. This basically turns them into a thing that relies on
orange
to survive, fixing this is almost impossible. This gas is very rare in the orangestverse, and being removed from the atmosphere by the Orangeversians.
Citrusinegen
[
]
Citrusinegen is a toxic liquid that turns voids into Orangen. It is rare in solid form but in solid form it sucks in Orangen and converts it into Citrusinegen liquid, cooling it down. In a gas state it will instantly decay into Orangen, but not actually instantly as it takes 340 milliseconds to decay into Orangen. If contact is made with gas citrusinegen before it has decayed it will have similar effects to orangen inhalation, hijacking the brain and making you only able to sense "Orangeness". It is hard to describe what orangeness is, but imagine being covered in orange juice, then pouring it into your eyes as they are held open with rigid orange peels and it drips into your lungs and then your skin is replaced with orange peels, and you drink a gallon of orange juice concentrate in this state. That is less than 1% of what orangeness feels like.  Anyway, citrusinegine in its liquid state is flammable to a much greater extent than gasoline, but requires orangen or orangestium as fuel instead of something like oxygen. If compressed into a small enough size in any state Citrusinegen will form an Orange Hole, which produces orange elements specific to
Orangeverse
and
Orangerverse
. Orange Holes have another function of converting these into things such as Orangen from Orangerium and Orangerium from Orangium.
Aurantium-183
[
]
Aurantium-183 is an isotope of Aurantium exclusive to the orangestverse, being the most orange isotope of aurantium. Other isotopes are Small Orangevalue, but this isotope is very close to the Large Orangevalue, however due to how orange it is, it is invisible to most entities. It's also pretty rare. It is only stable in its liquid and gas states.
The Orange Core
[
]
The orange core is a giant sphere at the center of the Orangestverse, and emits orange energy. It is responsible for all orange in
The Infinite Colors
. Orange energy is powerful and can be used to power entire
Archrealities
. When Orangen is in the presence of this orange energy, it acts like it's cooled down. Deeper into the Orangestverse, Orangerverses become more rich in another material called Orangite. Orangite forms when Orangen and orange energy are permanently binded to eachother through unknown processes. This causes the Orangen to freeze. Orangite becomes more common deeper in because the Orangen in the Orangerverses are exposed to more orange energy when closer to the core. Since Orangite is so hard to get due to the side effects of Orangerverses and having to travel across The Infinite Colors, Orangite sells for really expensive in Alphasmial Markets. Orange energy has a similar property to liquid Orangen, where if you enter the Orangestverse, the orange energy instantly turns you orange. This effect also wears off in 1 hour of being outside the Orangestverse. If you look at the orange core, you'll be instantly blinded orange in the spot where the core was visible. However, it can be seen with advanced imagery technology, and appears oranger than Orangestium. Anything that touches it will turn into more orange energy.
Fantas
[
]
Fantas appear very rarely in the Orangestverse, and they are just cans of Orangestium but they're only the size of a few molecules (atoms? idk) of orangestium and they spew it out and dissipate when opened. There is only one type of fanta and they are very rare so you won't find any. (also because all of them were used) They are also all orange so text on the fanta cans are just THICK so you can see it because it's all orange. If you try to open a fanta it will be pretty hard since it weighs way less than a fingerprint. You will probably just squish it and it will burst into a tiny bit of Orangestium. The Orangestium is not contained inside the fanta, it just pops into existence when an opening to the inside of the fanta is created or when it is destroyed. All the fantas are now gone because they were discovered as a source of Orangestium and used.
Other Fruits
[
]
Other than oranges, there are other fruits that are inside the Orangestverse, and they grow on the surfaces or interiors of Orangerverses. Their names are all a spin on the word orange.
Ororanges
[
]
Ororanges are small berries that are the same orange as the average orange as a fruit. They grow on bushes closer to the orange core and taste the same as a normal orange with a slight taste of orange Fanta. This taste is due to the juice being mainly 85% orange juice and 15% liquid Orangen. Under normal circumstances, Orangen is not liquid at the temperature Ororanges are exposed to, so instead the Orangen is condensed from orange energy. This is why Ororanges grow closer to the orange core.
Orangers
[
]
Orangers are like oranges however they are somehow more orange than the fruit the color came from. The juice of this fruit tastes like orange juice but noticeably stronger. They grow on trees at the surface of the Orangestverse. They are also rounder than normal oranges. They are commonly used as a source of Vitamin C for Orangeversians.
Pineoranges
[
]
Pineoranges are similar to pineapples and oranges at the same time, and is the closest you'll get to something not orange in the Orangestverse. They have sharp spikes on them all around and they don't point all in one direction. This is to protect the flesh of the pineorange which is probably one of the best tasting things that still taste somewhat like an orange. They are used in luxury foods for rich Orangeversians, due to them being hard to get, hard to open, and also delicious.
Sporanges
[
]
Sporanges are similar to oranges, however they are completely hollow and have sharp spikes on the outside, there is a 1% chance that the spikes on a sporange will be brittle and a 0.00000000005% chance that it will not be hollow. They appear randomly throughout the orangestverse and after 600 seconds of existing, they will disintegrate and the particles making up the sporange will not be connected to eachother, eventually these particles make up other things.
Coranges
[
]
Coranges are like regular oranges, but they have a hot core that produces lots of heat and energy for seemingly no reason. They are very rare (690,420,133,769x rarer than sporanges which are not hollow). They usually appear in random spots inside of the orangestverse, and they appear via popping into existence. The mass of a corange is about 91.8 kg. Since coranges are popping into existence inside of the orangestverse, that means that its mass is slowly increasing, however negligibly due to its size being infinite and the mass of a corange being finite.
Parasitorange
[
]
Parasite Oranges are weird fruits that grow on other fruits, and look like bananas but very very orange. They feed off of the orange juice contained in oranges, before bursting and spreading trillions of seeds out. These seeds then fly around before sticking to oranges and they then begin growing on the surfaces and interiors of oranges, and then the cycle continues. Upon bursting they also produce large excess amounts of orangen, orangeium, orangerium, and orange juice among other compounds and elements related to Orange. At the end of its lifespan the parasitorange weighs 1/10 of an orange's weight. The excess matter also just forms, the orange bits consumed remain there as a weird little bubble on the orange before popping, spewing out orange matter.
Laroirange
[
]
Types of wired oranges that connect another one, and have a 0.000000000004% chance to be hollow. These oranges have another orange inside of them, concluding the multiversalic statement of these types of fruits. They however smell like breezing oranges for the most part. This means that they could also glow to the brightest state they they could afford in patience. They can even spread across any orange verse there is, and possibly go faster. Themselves can slow, and fasten time with no hesitation, and they also cannot be eaten, since they have so much light matter into them, that they might re-spawn, only to make you explode, and become a simple orange.
