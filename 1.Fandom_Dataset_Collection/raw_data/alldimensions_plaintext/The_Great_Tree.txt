The
Great Tree
is a large
[

]
structure (just in case you couldn't tell from its name) which contains
Piy
, and has a (hopefully, relatively) interesting shape which will be further elaborated on in the rest of this overtly generic article. again, just in case you couldn't tell from the name, it is also a tree. i will now begin to elaborate further on its structure. (don't mind that we're not even a paragraph in and already i have used the word structure twice) the great tree is basically a large tree which has many branches, many in this context referring to literally more than you can mathematically quantify. each of these branches are basically much bigger piys, as they themselves branch off, the last iteration of each branch eventually ends in a piy-like structure, because of course they do. every branch is covered in bramble structures, which often sprout "fruits",

]
(aka glowing orbs which are just really big universes) which then eventually fall off of the tree, and from there many things can happen to them, which due to some factors, mostly (or rather almost entirely) laziness, i will not actually say anything about. make headcanons or something. by this point you are probably wondering what oril is, and for now i will continue to elaborate even further on the almost certainly boring and definitely not artifically inflated structure of the verse that i definitely didn't come up with while taking a shit. atop the tree is just a big glowing orb, which is around 1/40 the size of the tree itself. the orb in question basically doesn't actually exist for any other reason other than it was one of the things i came up with and now i don't feel like removing it from the article. you can make headcanons about that too if you want. anyway, the base of the great tree is covered with brambles that do not sprout any fruit (they're virgins lmao) and, similarly to the orb

, don't actually serve any purpose other than "empty space bad". descending even further, the tree rests upon a large pyramid 4-5x

its size, which contains, as you might expect, its root system. the pyramid in question is made of an unknown type of soil not yet found anywhere else except for MIPS'

further we find yet another big orb, which is just some big stupid unnamed verse.

anyway, finally moving onto oril, which is probably the only reason anyone

is even still reading this.

oril is basically just one of the fruits on the tree, specifically from just outside of the lowest iteration spiral structures branching off of one of the lower mains. not much is known about oril, other than that it has many brambles sticking out of the top of it, and that it is in one of 3 possible states: 1. it is stuck to the tree and will remain there forever, 2. it is currently falling off and towards the pyramid / the orb (as its
exact
position isn't very well known to all of the shit for brains cretins that it contains) and 3. that it is about to fall off in an indeterminate amount of time.

One Oril
Our location
[
]
Our Piy exists in hyperclusters of other Piy, and billions of Piy clusters are all in our Hyperpiy. Another Hyperpiy might contain nothing at all, just Oriel dust, some debris, and a black hole in the middle, a type of Hyperpiy. Our product is very rare because there is 9% of it in Oriel.
Simple explanation
[
]
There are many
Piy
and our own ones we are currently in
Piy Supercluster
Let's move forward a little and see many Piy Superclusters around us, which is Piy Hypercluster, which is
Hyperpiy
itself. Well, let's get out of this object that resembles a galaxy (Hyperpiy), and we now see the closest Hyperpiy to our own Hyperpiy. We are now getting out of Hyperpiy. Cluster, and then we see the billions of Hyperpiy, and then the Hyperpiy Hypercluster, and we see Oril's wall, which is our Oril, and outside Oril there is a white fractal stem, which is holding him, and this fractal stem is for our Great Tree.

god forbid theres fall damage in TGT
Inside one of Oril there are hyperclusters of
Piy’s
, but not our Oril. Our Oril contains hyperclusters of
Hyperpiy
, and the
Hyperpiy
contains trillions of
Piy.
