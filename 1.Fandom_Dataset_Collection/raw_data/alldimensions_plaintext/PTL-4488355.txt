PTL-4488355 is a large
universe filament
in a
Le Jorino area
between 2
xenoverses
not too far from our own. Estimated to contain 413,000,000,000 universes, it is an exceptionally large and dense filament, even larger than
JXR-2011-63871PFVRa16.
It is confirmed to have life. Because of its incredibly slow growth rate, it is approximated to be 2,430,000,000,000 years old, making it the oldest known universe filament larger than 10QLY.
