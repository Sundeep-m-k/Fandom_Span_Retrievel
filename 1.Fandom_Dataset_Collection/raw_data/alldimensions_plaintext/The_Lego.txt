The Lego is one of the
most feared verses in existence
. If any cosmic entity/verse steps/touches the top area of The Lego,
they will be seriously damaged, possibly fatally
.
The Lego appears to be a large, red-colored cube with very angular edges and 4 short, cylindrical "nodes" which stick out from the top. The Lego
has been seen to combine with other Lego copies
, using its "nodes" and sticking it to the bottom of another Lego. When it does this, it pretty much nullifies The Lego's damaging capability unless it is pulled off (which can only be done by powerful gods).
In earlier times, The Lego was extremely dangerous as it was
extremely hard to destroy
. However in recent times, The Lego was found to be extremely easy to move, making it much less dangerous/feared. Still, it is relatively hard to avoid as it is extremely big.
All verses/cosmic entities which got damaged by The Lego had many deep cuts all over them, and were extremely hard to fix, even by a
Sealbot
.
As The Lego has glaring similarities to
The Verse Trap
, many creatures have theorized that they were both created by a
Cosmic Zaaaaaaaap
.
