Imniuni
[
]
An
Imniuni
is an unique kind of
Universe
that is based on the imaginary axis (
Imaginary Hierarchy
). These make up the elemental basis of this hierarchy similar to universes.
Functionality
[
]
Through an imaginary perspective, the laws of physics in these verses still function congruently to universes, although from a real frame they start to break down into non-existence.
The reason why they function congruently is because their
imaginary protoverses
are "locked" to
Blueprint
Particles
in realspace. They're not completely locked because of their separation from the real axis, and doesn't affect the relative
existence rank
.
Composition
[
]
The Imniunis are composed of various Imaginary cosmic structures, again similar to the Universes.
