A
kardaparticle
(♮
V or E or F
) is a small particle, mostly found in
Kappa Particles
. They are represented by the music-based natural sign, then a letter corresponding to the first letter of the type of kardaparticle. There are three main kinds of Kardaparticles, vertex (♮
V
), edge (♮
E
), and face (♮
F
). Only vertex Kardaparticles have a countably infinite number of number of them in the discovered parts of verses.
The particle was named after Nikolai Kardashev, who also invented the Kardashev Scale.
Types of Particles
[
]
As previously mentioned, kardaparticles have three main types, vertex, edge, and face. These form the vertices, edges, and faces of all Kappa Particles. It should be noted that these don't actually form faces, edges, of vertices, but they form something similar of the scale of ∅ dimensions instead of 2.
