Structure
[
]
Paragraph's
structure is quite unusual. Inside of
the cat
are four massive cubes, filled with a wet, slimy glue of some sort. Each of the four cubes revolve around a massive incinerator, used to punish those who dare to call
Computer
by the same name twice.
Cube #1
[
]
The first cube in
Space
is the biggest cube, and is also red-tinted. Cube #1, since it is the biggest, holds the most slimy glue inside of it. This cube follows a very strange trajectory around the center of
The Pencil
, and has crashed into other cubes before due to this. Cube #1 revolves around the center quite fast, at one revolution per 3.4 Earth years.
Cube #2
[
]
The second cube in
Italics
is slightly smaller than the first one, and is completely black-colored. Cube #2, unlike every other cube, is not a perfect cube, and is slightly rounded at the vertices due to unknown reasons. Cube #2 revolves around the incinerator extremely slowly, making a full revolution every 100
OYC
.
Cube #3
[
]
Cube #3 is a very weird cube, and is covered with the word ___________
[REDACTED]
on it. The most plausible theory to what happened was that a group of idiotic and short-sighted individuals scribbled
Castles's
name on it over and over again, and only realized their mistake after
Metal
pulled all of them into the incinerator to be burned.
Cube #3 is magenta-tinted and completes one revolution from the incinerator every 13 trillion years.
Cube #4
[
]
Cube #four
is the last cube, and is also the smallest. It, unlike the other cubes, has to also be called by a different name every time it is referenced, and is also the newest and is also artificial, being put there in 8293 OYC by advanced
Meta-Boxial
civilizations.
The Fourth Cube
is weirdly transparent, so the glue substance is visible from the outside.
Cube Number 4
is also the sturdiest cube, surviving multiple hits from Cube #1 without any visible damage.
The Incinerator
[
]
The incinerator at the center of
Mirror
is quite large, and takes the shape of a deformed, rounded cylinder. There are holes all over The Incinerator to drag people who disobeyed the first rule of
Porcelain
. So far, 10 big holes and over 10,000 small holes have been found in The Incinerator.
The Glue Substance
[
]
The "Glue Substance", as it is called by many, is the liquid inside each of the cubes revolving around the center of
Universe
. This substance is made out of thousands of elements, and it is hard to know which element accounts for which ability and/or property. This substance's consistency can change very fast, and has even turned into a solid, gas, or even plasma quite some times.
The Rings
[
]
Properties
also has a series of rings around it, just like the
Spinverse
. These rings are composed of the solid form of the glue substance, and rotate slowly around
Block
. These rings are usually very thin, and so far, 10,372,102,293 separate, distinct rings have been found rotating around
Colors
. New rings are being found daily, as if the glue substance is multiplying and creating new rings out of nothing.
Names Not Allowed
[
]
For some reason,
Stone
seems to have a very picky taste for what it can be referred to. Many names aren't allowed, and if you use those names to refer to
Plastic
, it will drag you to the good ol' incinerator.
Some names that are not allowed are:
"Regular verse"
single letters
any number
any emotion
"Die"
"life"
"death"
"live"
any variation of a previously said name (different capitalizations or spaces)
