Okay, Now this is a great object verse. All of the object verses have started useless but progressively got more and more useful. This one is now the most useful out of all of them.
What this verse does is immediately bring you to anywhere in the
Omniverse
ever. It is instant, since it is a hyperspeed car verse. This verse has about 10,000,000,000,000 uses per day. It never runs out of fuel.
This car is blue and only has one seat. However, since the seat is

{\displaystyle 10^{510}}
ly large, about 100,000,000,000 people can use it at once (some of the "people" who use it are very large"). This is useful.
This car isn't very fancy or interesting which makes it quite bland. However, the usage of this and the fact that it is instant makes it a very memorable verse that everyone knows and lovesÂ :)
