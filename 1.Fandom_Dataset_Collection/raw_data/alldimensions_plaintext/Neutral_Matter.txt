Neutral particles have the same mass as their regular counterpart, but their charge is imaginary (If an electron has charge -1, a neutrelectron has charge -i). Bosons are only stable as neutral particles, which is why they do not have antiparticle versions. The symbols of neutral particles are the symbols of their regular counterparts with a tilde (~) on top.
Here is a list of neutral particles:

Generation
[

Non-boson neutral particles are very hard to generate. Here are some ways to get them:
Decompose
quarks
or antiquarks into
strings
and combine them again into neutral matter
Go out into an
exaversal void
to collect them as rare background radiation
Extract them from
purple quettagiants
