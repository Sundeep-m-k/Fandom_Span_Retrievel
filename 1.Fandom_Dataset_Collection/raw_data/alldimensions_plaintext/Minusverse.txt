What is a minusverse?
[
]
A minusverse is a very weird type of a verse, almost like it's radioactive, it can make anything or everything explode and the matter will dissapear and change to a "isotope version" of
i
âˆ’
o
{\displaystyle i-o}
where
i
=
{\displaystyle i=}
current "isotope" and
o
=
{\displaystyle o=}
object decayed.
The chance of an object to decay
[
]
The chance for a planet to decay is
i
2
/
2
{\displaystyle i^{2}/~2}
where
y
{\displaystyle y}
part of the curve is the biggest possible value for
o
{\displaystyle o}
, and a smaller value for
o
{\displaystyle o}
would mean more percentage for a object to decay. This object decaying is called decation, and this one im have talked is a +decation, and when you gain a object is -decation.
