The
Hugeverses
are
very
huge (duh) verses which are part of the
Generic Hierarchy
, and they contain various
Massiveverses
, their contents, etc.
They're the first of many verses in the Generic Hierarchy to contain mini-hierarchies all of the same name as themselves, as there are multiple Hugeverses inside one another for 100 layers per top Hugeverse, with each Hugeverse being either thousands or millions of times bigger than the previous one in size and lightly less in number of previous verses. The only uniting factor of these verses is sharing one nameless deity across the top Hugeverse, as well as their sea-swampish green color. The verses and literally every single one after them have natural anti-glitch protection due to its swollen size compared to a
TOH
verse of the same number.
Hugeverses also self-duplicate within their mini-hierarchies in a similar manner to the
Unnamed Hierarchy
, applying to the ones inside the
Enormousverse
as well, although they have the superreal layering in the same system to
Superverses
, with duplication combining to create one of the densest class 1
TGH
verses, although the
Verse Container
is somehow far, FAR more dense.
