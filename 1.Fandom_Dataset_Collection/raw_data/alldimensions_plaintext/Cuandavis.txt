A
Cuandavis
(plural: cuandavii)
is a subatomic particle which has similar properties to a
proton
. However, it is different enough that atoms created using it have different properties than atoms made using protons.

Composition
[
]
Cuandavii are composed of two
up quarks
(u)
and a
rizz quark
(r)
. This makes them very similar to protons in composition, only with one differing quark.
Cuandavic Atoms
[
]
Cuandavic atoms are
atoms
which have cuandavii in their composition. They can be categorised as partially cuandavic, having both cuandavii and protons, or fully cuandavic, only having cuandavii and no protons.

of Cuandavii; that is, a Cuandavis and an ‘Anticuandavis’, a subatomic particle composed of two antiup quarks (u̅) and one antirizz quark
(r̄)
, within a bound state. There are sometimes disputes about whether Cuandavium could be considered a cuandavic atom.
