Structure

The Hat has many different rims on it. While it has these rims, it is very unstable, and it can often fall apart. There is a lot of glue in THE BOX, and that glue is used to piece The Hat together in case of an emergency. There is a sphere on the front of The Hat, and this ball is the core of The Hat. The heart.
The core

The Hat's ball in the middle can make The Hat do everything it wants. It can teleport anywhere instantly, it can turn into anything else. It is extremely powerful, which is why The Hat is so famous.
Material
[
]
The Hat is made out of a lot of sewing material. While it is very small, it is extremely dense, being much much much denser than a black hole (see density). It is, however, made of negative sized
Galaxy Filamemt
which allows it to be so dense.

Void

Even though The Hat is negative sized, that doesn't stop it from having a void. There is an extremely large void in the middle of The Hat, and it is full of nothing. This void is part of the reason it is unstable, combined with the rims. The void imbalances The Hat a lot.
