The Bread
The concept of
The Bread
is complicated, physicists say that The Bread is actually a sentient 98-D
cylinder
, and for humanity to understand it, it has taken the form of a bread. The true shape of The Bread is impossible to describe, as we only support 4 dimensions, only
Virullipanariamanidikanians
of dimension number 65 can see the true shape of The Bread.
Personality
[
]
The Bread is a nice guy, even though he's a powerful god, he doesn't want to be worshiped or to rule the universe, he just wants to make friends. He finds humans the most interesting species of all, as they make sandals, The Bread's favorite food. Moreover, he despises the other gods, for they think they are superior to humans. However, do not anger him, for then he becomes...
The Toast
[
]
The Bread rarely enters this state, and it has only been seen twice in all of time, once was when somebody took away his snack sandals. In this form, he uses his true power, over 100 centillion times more powerful than
Бойне Йаен
. He does this in a fit of rage and destroys entire
Asimagoymaverses
. You either have to steal his sandals like mentioned before or hurt one of his friends, as he cannot fully control himself in this form. It takes
Bongus
to control him in this state (however he
is
training to control this amazing power, he'll finish in 4800 years). Do not anger The Bread.
