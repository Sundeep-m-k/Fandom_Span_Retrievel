The 1st
[

Wait, but how did you even get here anyway?
This is the first part of the structure.
Nonsense Essences
Type
Essences that are at least
UNIQ--postMath-000000002-QINU
Stability
Extremely stable. It produces energy from the light in the center of it.
Contained by
Nonsense
Contains
Equal to one of The Final Box's sizes. They are inside The All Imagination Container. It contains the Nonsense Cores
The 2nd

The Essences
The second part of the structure. It is rounded by the
atmosphere
sphere that Nonsense has.
In its state like this, it has the shine in the middle were all gods are connecting to.

Nonsense Cores
Type
A core with infinite thoughts, and events inside it, though its size is TREE(3)
Stability
It has moved around with energy inside it by the Nonsense Essences. Its still stable in usage.
Contained by
Everything else in here, but its still big which can contain a lot.
Contains
a lot. especially The Barrel.
Nonsense Core
This is the part.
The smallest 'Nonsense'. Still big. It is the importance of everything that its seen, so its extremely impossible to destroy.
Survency: There are different nonsenses like
Nonsensiverse
. 'Nonsense' would be the biggest 'Nonsense' because its itself. A pattern that follows this is by breaking the laws, and rules between different elements for something no one can understand. It is clues on how they gather up beyondance for a limit to none.
The essences are a shadow admit from its cores. They break physics of beyondance for 'Nonsense, and Nonsensity Itself. They somehow have life in them which being 100% life, like the container with all imaginations. it uses that to 0 to the 1, and expanding. Not collapsing.
There are several codes in the cores. Its worthy of ending fiction itself, but does not want to do that, as it knows. Used in the core itself remains unstained and has full of every knowledge.

Yep, its a conversion error. No can do. Estimate it for yourself, and see how it goes with it.
