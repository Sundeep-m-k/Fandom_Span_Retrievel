The Branch
is an important object that is part of
The Tree
; it helps to communicate vital information about
space
throughout said tree. There are multiple
Branches
, each of which contain different laws of space, which branch off from the laws of space of the
Branch
below.
The bottom
Branch
contains the most "normal" laws of space, such as the fact that containing bodies are bigger than smaller bodies, and the fact that things cannot contain themselves. Due to selfverses that have sizes greater than themselves like
The Box
existing on our
Branch,
we are not
at the bottom,
but rather,
near the bottom.
The bubbles within
The Branch
are impossible to penetrate, but this fact can easily be overriten by changing data in
The Core of Everything
or if you are given the ability to
transcend said bubbles.
The ability to
transcend the bubbles
is natural to the blue version of
The Sap
for reasons explained in said article.
Because of this, the bubbles in
The Branch
have wild trans-bubble changes in reality. To prevent collision from these bubbles from being too drastic,
blue The Sap
exists to randomly swap information throughout
The Branch's
bubbles.
The material surrounding bubbles of
The Sap
of
The Branch
appears to be materials similar to those of
The Box
; they aren't physical containers, and if you try to "escape" these barriers, then (most) of the time, you will end up back where you started. This allows for insane amounts of energy to be contained within
The Branch
which have more energy than themselves, giving an beyond infinitely renewable energy source for
The Branch.
