A
Semiverse
is a verse that can be found within any universe but ours. It extends the concept of nested verses into a downwards scale, each Semiverse containing a smaller Semiverse. Their size can range from an infinitesimal (which then contains the
Protoverse
) to 486.2 million lightyears (contained by a
Universe
).
Since the Semiverse doesn't actually exist according to EUSI, no civilization has been able to take a photo of one. The image shows an interpretation of a Semiverse from an artist. It is also believed that when all Semiverses die, all traces of BestNoobReborn will be lost with them.
A type of -verse that is similar to a semiverse but exists inside
Hyperverses
instead of inverses is the
Hypoverse
. Hypoverses are distinguished from
Xenoverses
in that they are physical, rather than simulated.
