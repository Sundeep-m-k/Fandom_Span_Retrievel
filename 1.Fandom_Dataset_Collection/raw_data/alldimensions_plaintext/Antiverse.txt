Introduction
[
]
An
Antiverse
is practically a universe full of anti-matter instead of your usual normal matter. Physics here might be different or still the same, Beings from this universe will think that the anti-matter they have is normal matter and our
universe
is anti-matter. Its size is 1.2 septillion light-years.
Time
[
]
Time goes backwards here, so the current year there is 2021 BCE, part of the Egyptian times. Technology is collapsing. A human lifetime goes old to young like Benjamin Button.
Colors

In this universe, colors are inverted. So this means humans are colored blue with white hair and scary eyes. Likewise, the Earth has yellow-orange oceans and skies, black clouds and ice, blue deserts, purple grass and forests, etc. The Sun is a cold star colored
navy
blue. The space is colored white. The stars are seen as black dots as if it were filled with black pepper.
Scientifically though, the above paragraph defies common Physics since firstly, the bluer a Sun is, the hotter that makes it, since it would be emitting light of higher frequencies therefore light of more
energy
, increasing its heating power. Secondly, in the Earthly night sky, our mostly black region means an absence of light being emitted from that region of the night sky (also understood as 'negligible light being emitted from that region of the night sky'). Stars could well be black, as if black holes, but a white night sky simply means the entire space (all regions of nothingness) does in fact emit light, which is a contradiction since when there is nothing is space, then nothing can emit light. But this is the Antiverse, so this somehow works.

The suns move around the earth. There is no gravity, just "light energy" which acts like dark matter in our universe. "light anti-matter" is the force pushing the antiverse apart. The antiverse is getting smaller all the time. It was born by having a big bang that made it gigantic. Then it started condensing.
