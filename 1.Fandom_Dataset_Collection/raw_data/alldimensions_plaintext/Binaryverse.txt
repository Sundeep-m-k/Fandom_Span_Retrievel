About
[
]
The
Binaryverse
is an one-of-a-kind
verse
, whose information is in the form of zeros and ones. Thanks to this quality, this verse has also earned itself the nickname of
Booleanverse
, and for good reasons.
Origins
[
]
It was created
140 million
OYC
ago by an advanced
civilization
as an experiment. This was before creating verses by fine tuning them was not understood enough to be made accurately, so it had to be done in a virtual space.
Characteristics of particles
[
]
Instead of each
particle
having a relatively inexpansive list of characteristics and
laws
guiding it, determined by complex equations and randomly chosen constants, the particles of the Binaryverse have a large amount of properties, each one checked off by either a 0 or a 1. A truth, or a false.
When a particle A comes into contact with another particle B, a sector of 12 properties by the name of "contact list" then answers 'yes' or 'no' to all of the questions, which optimally describe the particle with a sense of 99.9923% accuracy. It is not 100% accurate, as the limited amount of available memory this particle has requires it to be as optimal as possible and to cut corners, even at a slight cost of mistakes.
The position of a particle in space is not important to its properties, alongside with the fact, that uniquelly describing every rational number (rational is used in this case instead of real, as the smallest length in this verse is also not 0) using truth symbols, is impossible with such limited memory.
There are 70 different kinds of particles, and so a segment of elements totalling 70, is allocated in the memory. Because only 1's and 0's are used, it might appear that logically, 69 of those would be 0's, while a single 1 would determine a property.
The particles have a fix to this waste of memory, by marking and representing the entire table of properties by that singular 1. Then, the universe already knows that the rest of the properties are 0, so their definitions get additional "- or -"s attached to them. It is known, that the question behind the "or" is 0, so that one is ignored, and if the answer is 1 or 0, it is assumed in the place of the question after the "or". This takes place for some time, before the particle undergoes a change, upon which the addons are moved back to their slots, the particle then answers the question as to which element it is, and goes back to adding on defintions.
Most other properites are described by a 0 or 1, independent from others and don't need these optimizations. However, all properties are tied with all other properties through intelligent and delicate methods. A single small change to a definition can mean the difference between the Binaryverse existing or not.
Variations
[
]
If one were to translate a particle into an ordered set of 1s and 0s, the length of the list would determine the total possible amount of combinations of particles, and while that number is definitely large, if one were to generate a particle of totally random answers, it would be a miracle if the particle would be even alowed to exist, not even speaking of whether the particle would fizzle out into thin air or collapse or get stuck in a feedback loop. The point is, that the amount of possible particles is large, but not a scope wide enough to create complex things like multicellular
life
.
Life?
[
]
Life is impossible due to the reasons above mentioned, but would also not be sustainable, due to the contact list length. The 99.9923% accuracy is more than good enough, when dealing with cosmic structures like
nebulae
,
planets
,
stars
, that are harsh and large, but is detrimental to delicate life. The amount of predicted mutations that would occur would make life at the scale of viruses to dinosaurs impossible. This is where the variations come in:
This experiment verse was expanded upon almost instantly as it was published and tested. Roughly 23 OYC days after this project became public, a contact list with 13 properties instead of 12 was discovered, which improved accuracy to 99.9994% of all simulated random collision cases. This was improved again, 16 OYC days later, while still keeping the count at 13, to an accuracy of 99.999902%, which, if paired with a larger amount of types of particles, allow for some form of cancer-type life to flourish, at small scales. 1 OYC later, using a supercomputer, a team of scientists developed, by expanding the list to house 14 slots, managed to bring the mistake probability down to
μ

{\displaystyle \mu\approx6.1\times10^{-8}}
, and, with many refinements and optimizations over 1,131 OYC days, brought it down to
μ
≈
8.8

{\displaystyle \mu\approx8.8\times10^{-11}}
. If cosmologically scaled life was conjectured to be possible in a larger version of the original Binaryverse, this would make it a real possibility.
Different versions of the Binaryverse were experimented with liberally, usually by just seeing what will happen when something random is changed, but also many attempts at improving the Binaryverse to be able to house life. However, even though basic life was achieved eventually, conciousness was never made and wasn't even attempted to be made.
