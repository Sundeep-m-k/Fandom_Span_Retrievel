I Don't Have Any Ideas is a piece of writing seemingly documenting what a
Transcendent Omni-God
was feeling when they were bored and were trying to come up with a verse or cosmic entity to create. This document is extremely long, and seemed to not be written very well. Many parts are just rambling, with many times having a single thought turn into an entire essay-length paragraph.
Discovery
[
]
I Don't Have Any Ideas was discovered by
Alphasm
when he was traveling through Realms trying to terminate
The Disruptor
and stop it from messing up more Realms. When Alphasm found
I Don't Have Any Ideas
, he was very confused. Later, he realized that it was a Transcendent Omni-God who left the document here. He decided to leave it where it was.

I Don't Have Any Ideas
, as said before, is extremely long. The text below is a shortened version of it.
Oh no. I've been spending all my time at the Random RPG game wiki and that's bad. Wait, and what about AD?? NOO!!! I haven't made a single article in over 2 days and that's not good for me oh no! AHHHHHHHH!!! I NEED TO WRITE AN ARTICLE NOWW!!! Ok. What about.. that purgatory page I've been thinking to write? Ok. Chess and stuff. Ok. So... let's name it... The Opposite Side? Sounds cool, let's make it. Ok... Mysterious.. make it sound cool... Beyond The Trox... oh no. I'VE RAN OUT OF IDEAS ALREADY?!?! BAD ICANTEDIT!!! Ok. Another page. Let's see... The Chasms? Sounds even cooler. Let's make it. Hmm... 'The Chasms are a network of endless pits that-' NOOO!!!! I'VE RAN OUT OF IDEAS AGAIN!?!!?!? AAIAIIAIAIAIIAIAIAAAIIAIA!!!!!!!! FINE. FINNEEEEEE!!!! Calm down ICantEdit... Calm down... Ok. Let's be determined and make The Chasms again. Ok. 'The Chasms are a network of pits-' DANG IT. DANGGGGGGGG IT!!!!!! This is the 3rd fricking time I've ran out of ideas today. FINE. I will decide to make the best article yet. But... ICantThinkOfAnyArticleToWrite!!!!!! BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I can't think of anything to write, maybe I can ask other people for help. BestNoobReborn maybe. Ok, time to write this. 'I need ideas. I need ideas'. Ok, that should be enough. Also, I could go on Discord and say the same thing too. 'I need ideas im going insane.' Good. I will hope that they give me ideas. Now, let's just go on the VS battles wiki and look at its 25848 pages. That's a lot more than AD, with its measly 2876 pages. Ooooh! I just got an idea. THAT'S FRICKING PERFECT!!!!!!!!! GOOOOD JOB ICANTEDIT!!! Let's name this page "I Don't Have Any Ideas." OOOOOH!!! THIS IS EPIC!!
Now, the first part.
'I Don't Have Any Ideas is a piece of writing seemingly documenting what a Transcendent Omni-God was feeling when they were bored.... blah blah blah. Now time to write the meat of the page. Let's start with... 'Oh no. I've been spending all my time at the Random RPG game wiki and that's bad. Wait, and what about AD?? NOO-'
Wait. HAVE I JUST REPEATED THE WHOLE THING OVER AGAIN?!?! Ok, this is getting paradoxical. If I had written this thing now, I am copying it again and now it's an infinite loop. Ok, I don't want to get trapped in this infinite loop, so I should just end this now, right? I don't even know what is going on now. So... should I stop now???
