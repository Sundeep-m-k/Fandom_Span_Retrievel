The eHoleret
[
]
What is it
[
]
What is it made of
[
]
It is made up of Heavily compressed carbon emitted from defuzenic
black holes
. It is also made out of some Pehterfecs who have been consumed and compressed by the
the bHoleret
, which then get drift of the the eHoleret.
Properties

Light
[
]
The eHoleret is known for having interstellar connection with light outside of the Probnev zone, as it is the one trait it shares with no other Holeret. The blue emissions also have been been scary to think about, since in this part of space colour is supposed to be impossible to manifest.
Dimensional Scales
[
]
Its size comes from its history as 1/4 of a Planck length. Then, it grew consuming
the Fortan
and
the Gorgea
, which both have been speculated to have been part of the eHoleret Explosion in 1367.
Theories
[
]
The theories about this get really weird, as some people saw a massive exerbeam of light in 1367, which caused two distant space objects to disappear, possibly the Fortan and the Gorgea.
Proper and Unproper expansion
[
]
The eHoleret has one trait of expansion called Proper and unproper expansion. Proper expansion is when it expands, but doesn’t consume anything around it as it has no intention to, but Unproper expansion is when it destroys what it consumes, taking it as a threat. No astronomical object can be seen as a threat to this thing, but the 41th dimensional mind probably helps that strange uncanny mindset of perceiving things as a threat when they aren’t.
