Overview
[
]
Petoria is an interstellar country that spans over 100 stars. It is ruled by the all-powerful Peter Griffin. It was first established in 2000.
History
[
]
Petoria first declared independence in 2000 when Peter Griffin realised his house was technically not part of the United States. Petoria's territory was only Peter's house, but then they conquered Joe's Pool, forming the first Petorian province - Joehio. The USA retaliated by invading and annexing the entirety of Petoria.
However, Petoria's story doesn't stop there. 12 years later, NASA needed a place to launch missions, and chose Peter's house. The USA government brang back Petoria as a puppet state for the space program. They launched various manned missions over the years, and established the Omega-1 as the first lunar space base. But lucky for Peter, he looked again at the paperwork and saw that space colonies launched from Petoria would not actually be part of the United States, so he resumed his presidency from the Omega-1 base. He started colonizing more of other planets and the Moon, reaching Ceres, Mercury, Mars, Ganymede and Pluto.
