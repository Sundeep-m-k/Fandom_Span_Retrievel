Nanoverse
Picture of a nanoversal planet showing its innards. If you look at its edge, you can see oceans and landmasses.

Nanoverses
are
verses
contained by
Microverses
. Unlike other verses, Nanoverses are entirely 2-dimensional, so a higher-dimensional being such as a
Human
could not entirely enter a nanoverse.
Structure
[
]
Nanoverses, like
universes
, are composed of a few
galaxies
. However, these galaxies only have two dimensions, as well as the
stars
and
planets
within.
Celestial Objects
[
]
A nanoversal planet is, instead of a spheroid, a circular object. However, they behave like 3-dimensional planets in which they have a
gravitational force
that points into their center (being their core) and lets them stay with their defined shape. Lots of these planets host 2-dimensional life, which can evolve, adapt, advance technologically and travel through space just like 3-dimensional life.
A nanoversal star is also circular, emitting light in all 2D directions.
Entities
[
]
There are lots of civilisations and entities in Nanoverses. Here are some of them.
TBA
Ximping: Weird god who has the appearance of a crudely drawn stickman with an abnormally large male genital and an oversized middle finger. Has an anomalously high amount of swag.
