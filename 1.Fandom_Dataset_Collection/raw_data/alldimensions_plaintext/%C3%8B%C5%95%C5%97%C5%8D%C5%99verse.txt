√ã≈ï≈ó≈ç≈ôverses
(also known as
√ã≈ï≈ó≈ç≈ôboxes
) are some of the most extreme
verses
at all times. They are also
self-contained
for ‚©∏‚Üë‚Üë‚©∏ times to make them even more extreme. So, they can be at any place and anything they can have. Because of the hyperoperation and the power set, this can no longer to get unstable. This is also a box container that contains all the most extreme verses in both the
class 28
and
class 29
as well as everything smaller so that they maximize the effect. Sometimes there are bigger variants of them that contains "smaller" versions of themselves. √ã≈ï≈ó≈ç≈ôverses are
box
-like
structures
which contain any of the extreme verses at lower levels than them.
They are
not
errors because they don't do this. So, they are very safe to even live there. There are some
cosmic entities
such as
2048 Tiles
which maintain and control verses in class 28/29, even the most extreme ones. But it is
impossible
to create or destroy them for those entities, meaning that only itself (this type of verse) can do this at certain moments and places.
States
[
]
There are two states in which √ã≈ï≈ó≈ç≈ôverses can be at, active and inactive. At times when √ã≈ï≈ó≈ç≈ôverses are active, they are ready to fight over
extreme glitchonicites
in
NULLverses
and bigger. There's a chemical reaction between the extreme glichonicites and
Endlessythings
(not actually an element). There's also a notice when attacking, unusual patches or strips appear right after your eyes. It's so very cloudy when doing this. And, the redder they are, the more intensity is getting through striking those glitchonicites.
In case of it's being inactive, it is the normal in which they are self-contained. These verses are still alive but are very calm and waves around them only just moving.
Stability
[
]
If you're wondering how stable is this type of verse, then read this: they can get up to 2
‚©∏‚Üë‚Üë‚©∏
times more stable than Endlessythings (that thing is already endlessly stable). Because they are made up of those atoms, the verses are getting as much extreme as possible. And because of the number of times they're self-contained, this can make them even more stable, as much as 2
‚©∏‚Üë‚Üë‚©∏
tetrated the amount of times it is stable at a standard state.
