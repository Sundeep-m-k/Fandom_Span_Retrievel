Appearance

The Garage, as the name implies, is a garage. It is filled with various musical equipment and insturments such as guitars, a drum set, amps, and other such things. The room is often rather messy, with random objects such as beer bottles and chip bags being strewn about. The verse has been reported to have a rather unpleasant smell, which likely comes from the body odor of its four inhabitants. Various other verses can be found in its nooks and crannies, such as the Infinibook, which resides on a shelf in the garage. The verse itself resides somewhere within the Epic NGLverse.

Wrathful Elevator
[
]
The four current members (Aaron, Evelyn, Seth, and Oliver) often use the instruments found in the Garage in order to play and create their own music. Together, they make up the band Wrathful Elevator. This band was formed around 2020, originally consisting of a lineup of Aaron, Evelyn, Iris, and Oliver. For currently unknown reasons, Iris was ejected from Wrathful Elevator sometime in 2021, and was replaced by Seth shortly after.
The genre of Wrathful Elevator can be described as rock or metal, although the exact subgenre seems to change frequently. As of February 3rd, 2022, the band has released 5 albums and 2 EPs. They have a rather large following, although they have yet to ever tour. They do, however, have a website, and have announced that they will start uploading videos of them playing to the internet.
Due to its large following, Wrathful Elevator actually has a great amount of influence on other verses. For example, after the release of the 2021 single "I Don't Need Your Stupid Escalator", usage of escalators dropped by significant amounts in countless place. Violence has even been caused as a result of their songs. After the release "Red Ring Rednecks", a song which was highly inflammatory and insulting to the Red Ring Cult, the cult not only publicly condemned Wrathful Elevator, but even went so far as to massacre a large number of its fans, resulting in an attack against the cult from the Purple Ring Organization, who generally love the band. This is turn led to a war between the various ring groups, resulting in a horrific amount of casualities. In an interview, bassist Oliver described the whole affair as "rather humorous".
Wrathful Elevator has raised some concerns over its threat to the safety of other verses. The members play with such incredible power that they often accidentally and unknowingly shatter smaller verses into nothingness. In the aforementioned interview, former drummer Iris stated that people negatively affected by the music of Wrathful Elevator should "get over themselves" and "quit being such posers". These statements led to a large amount of controversy over the band, and might have possibly led to the firing of Iris from the band.
Wrathful Elevator is still a very active group, and plans to record and release new music soon.
