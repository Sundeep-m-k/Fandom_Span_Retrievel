Formation
[
]
UNI-205 was formed 15.8 billion years ago, likely because of the coagulation of an unknown supernebula. It inflated to around 500 gigalightyears in diameter, and had its second expansion 6 billion years ago, when it expanded to ~710 gigalightyears in size. Its expansion has slowed down for now, and it's currently expanding at only 1 Gly per million years.
Physical Deviations
[
]
UNI-205 actually has very slight deviations, for example the electromagnetic force being 0.2% stronger.
Consequences
[
]
The stronger electromagnetic force means it's easier for planets to create prominent a magnetosphers, which is essential for life as it blocks the solar winds. This means that there are 8 billion known distinct civilisations over type-0.2 in this universe, being 2 billion more than average.
Civilisations
[
]
UNI-205 houses over 8 billion civlizations. The most advanced of these is a type 3.1, being the Lorymu civilisation.
