The Complex
This verse is quite empty, but not entirely empty, ironically. There are still huge numbers of negative sized particles like
Heck
and
the dentist
floating around in this verse's abyss. At the center of this verse contains an extremely strong pulsar that constantly emits radio waves. It is so strong that its radio waves pass through the 10 thousand or so
Complexes
that are floating orbiting the pulsar. The radio waves are the only way the inhabitants of the
Complexes
know that The Empty exists.
QUESTIONS:
1.HOW OLD IS THE EMPTY?
Some people believe that the Empty is currently
11010000110111101110111001000000111010001101
11010000110111101110111001000000111010001101
{\displaystyle 11010000110111101110111001000000111010001101^{11010000110111101110111001000000111010001101}}
quintillion years old. The empty is probably older than that.
2.WHERE DID THE PULSAR ORIGINATE FROM?
No one knows for sure. Some people believe it is as old as The Empty itself, but others believe that the pulsar was only recently made: about 100 trillion years ago.
3. WHY IS THIS VERSE SO FREAKING BIG?
Well then, why is every other thing on this wiki also big? Sorry, that doesn't really answer the question. No one knows.
