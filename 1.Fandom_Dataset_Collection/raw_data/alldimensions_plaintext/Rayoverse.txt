The Rayoverse is a very big verse. It is very big compared to
TREEVERSES
. It doesn't have life, nor planets, and only stars, black holes, galaxies, etc. This is because this universe is full of
rays
. Laser rays. They are laser beams that can heat any object to

of a cubic meter of stuff in the Rayoverse is filled with laser beams. If you somehow survived in the Rayoverse, you would only see red, because the lasers on the Rayoverse reflect A LOT of red.
In this verse, elements aren't possible, because the heat generated by the lasers make protons, neutrons, electrons, etc. wander alone from each other, so the only element possible is

+1
(one electron),
1
Ii (one neutron) and H
-1
(one proton), except if you don't get
the heat
.
Rayoverses get their lasers when they are 843 million years old.

We don't know what were it's chemical properties, bit it was element 125-160, and that it was blue/purple. It was an Transition metal or an Post-transition metal.
