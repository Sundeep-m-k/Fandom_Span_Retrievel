Overview
[
]
The South-Koreaverse's hierarchy is relatively evenly spread. Every being in it receives a high amount of education which takes the first 20% of one's existence. The Council that controls it is made up of many different high beings, however they have little to no meaning when by themselves. The South-Koreaverse is filled with white holes which keep ejecting matter and allow no external object to pass through it.
Backstroke of the West
[
]
The Backstroke of the West happened 80 Ωs ago. The West claimed to defend to defend the South-Koreaverse from the incumbent Forstroke of the East, however this ultimately resulted into the occupation of 65% of the verse. The West was responsible for spreading propaganda to turn the entire population against the North-Koreaverse, with whom the South-Koreaverse was once one.
A strong influence of the West can even be seen in the central galaxy with the name of 서울.
K-pop
[
]
K-pop is an organization funded by the West which specializes in making clones and using them for cringeworthy effects and addiction. Access of those clones to the central galaxy is strictly controlled, and the elders who have been present before the Backstroke of the West are still trying to oppose the entire program, believing it will only damage the South-Koreaverse.
Things that are 𝐁𝐀𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐃
[
]
Not enough is 𝐁𝐀𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐃 in the South-Koreaverse, however one noteworthy 𝐁𝐀𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐃 thing is supporting the East over the West. Saying North Korea is 𝐁𝐀𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐃!
mentioning japanese-verse culture is also 𝐁𝐀𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐃 but that is a story for another time
