History
[
]
In 2276, a German astronomer called Cayman Doßen discovered a universe in the UCZ (Universe Concentration Zone) using his telescope in the terraformed Pluto saw a universe that looked like a "cyan marble with a blue disc". Later, he called the universe 'Marmorversum'
In 2315, SBATLPU (Some Big Antennas To Localize Parallel Universes) used 65 antennas (41 in Earth, 15 in Mars, 6 in Pluto and 3 in Sedna) to picture the Marmorversum. When SBATLPU pictured the universe, the disc was a entire galaxy, and to cosmologists of the year 2315, the universe had a diameter of 125 ± 21.5 billion ly.
