A representation of a hierarchical tunnel. Each larger verse contains the verse which is the least smaller than it, and so on.
A Hierarchical Tunnel is an weird, abstract, and almost featureless tunnel that serves as a representation of a Hierarchy within the wiki. Countless of these tunnels exist, but only 32 are significant.
The higher number of nested verses in a hierarchy, the longer the Hierarchical Tunnel that represents it will be.

Uses
[
]
Hierarchical Tunnels are used solely for the purpose of letting a
Transcendent Omni-God
travel through a hierarchy faster, making navigation of a series of nested verses much easier. Hierarchical Tunnels are very valued for this reason.
Appearance
[
]
A Hierarchical Tunnel does not have a true appearance due to them being the literal representation of a hierarchy, a very abstract and ambiguous concept.
The image shown is only an impression of a Hierarchical Tunnel, and is most likely, if not certainly not what a Hierarchical Tunnel actually looks like.
Deletion
[
]
A Hierarchical Tunnel can get deleted, as shown when TCH (The Complete Hierarchy) got deleted by a Transcendent Omni-God by the name of
YellowMarkers1
. When a Hierarchical Tunnel gets deleted, its contents will not be deleted along with it.

Spaces Between Hierarchical Tunnels

Due to almost every verse being in a Hierarchical Tunnel, the only things here are isolated verses separated from any other verse. All verses here are not contained or do they contain ANY verse whatsoever.
