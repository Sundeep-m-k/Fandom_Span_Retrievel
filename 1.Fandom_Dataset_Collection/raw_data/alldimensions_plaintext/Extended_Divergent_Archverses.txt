This article is a collection of (soon) every
Archverse
, from the
Vendekaverse
to the
Rintaverse
to the
Rimaverse
and hey, maybe even the Ronaverse or something. We might tryeven get a Rivaverse, but we might make a second page before we reach it. See

Fish Progress Update
[
]
Unfortunately, me (Fish) has stepped down from giving a s$#t about continuing this project. Some have made further edits, so feel free to read those. Uhh everything before Emoaverse has been personally edited by me. Everything up to Zimaverse/Avantaverse has been personally edited and betterified by penthethexium56. uhh the rest is not really that finished, and nothing past Vodaverse has been started.
Back in my day this page was like 400kb but someone found like 100kb of text that was just commented out
Fun Fact: According to
https://wordstotime.com/
, it will take you
2 hours 40 minutes
to read this article, good luck!
Maybe I just have dementia but on a side note we are 45.682% of the way to 400kB! Maybe when I start giving a shit about this project once again we can make it to 400 fr
Anyways time to hibernate for 3 months
IF you have any ideas PLEASE ADD THEM in the comments, verses or top secret editor area.
NOTICE: Please help us solve math rendering errors!
NOTICE 2: This might have a second page just incase the page gets 100 archverses.
I might start work on the
Feeshverse
but who knows? Anyways if you have an image idea for the Feeshverse I'd love to see it you'd be a great help

Class 1:
The Original Class ᮱
[
]
Vendekaverse
- A chaotic verse where gravity pulls things "randomly" depending on their position.
Udekaverse
- A spiralling mega-black hole, which makes it very unstable yet perfectly balanced.
Tredaverse
- A 20D "Bread" that creates fields, packing away Udekaverses in its fractal geometry and protecting them from the Sortaverse
Sortaverse
- A goopy "liquid" verse that's comprised of incredibly stable matter
Rintaverse
- A spiral of "Stem Matter" that divides oceans of Sortaverse Matter and Kindaverse (Evil Sortaverse) Matter.
᮲
Class 2:
The Feesh Class ᮲
[
]
Quexaverse
- A verse that's mostly empty but is full of Quexaversal Fields which form its topology.
Peptaverse
- A fragile network of lines which are stable, crossing an unstable field, with a massive portal leading to an infinite void.
Ochaverse
- An infinitely long spiral with insane gravity which paradoxically fits in a finite space.
Nenaverse
- A much larger version of our universe with new particles and materials made of Spiralons, or Ochaverse Complexes.
Mingaverse
- A verse filled with "The Goo", holding a bunch of faster-than-light Sesrevagnim zooming around which are even bigger than Nenaverses
Lumaverse
- A verse filled with portals of varying sizes which can really go anywhere.
᮳
Class 3:
The Extended Class ᮳
[
]
Kamaverse
- A verse that is effectively a gigantic computer, with unfathomable computing power. It uses the Lumaverse portals to transmit data.
Jameaverse
- A seemingly infinite verse with many portals that lead to copies of the verse, but they are not the same place. Some think the Kamaverses are used to simulate the other copies.
Ianaverse
- A hyperbolic verse with many Jameaverses taking many colors. It contains clusters seperated by hyperbolic "superhighways".
Hottaverse
- A very lonely verse that governs time within its specific region. This is one of the more generic verses.
Grinaverse
- A verse filled with a (finite) spiral of Hottaverse Cells, with the walls made of compacted Hottaverses, and containing some Hottaverses each.
Fremaverse
- A spiraling, shifting verse filled with Grinaverses that act like a gas; a Grina-Gas. Often this shifting causes the Grina-Gas to collapse in on itself which wreaks havoc.
Echaverse
- A spiral of solid spheres which contain the Fremaverses. It's an extremely long-lived verse, unlike the verse inside it.
Drunaverse
- A sentient verse that prizes order in their size, density and mass. If a neighbouring Drunaverse breaks this order, they'll be removed... from this mortal plane.

"This verse is effectively the embodiment of chaos."
A Vendekaverse is a cluster of
Quettaverses
. Spacetime is distorted enough that gravity pulls things "randomly" depending on their position. Combined with the fact that objects move randomly on their own, objects with more matter than the
Universe
explode most of the time. The few
Quettaverses
that do survive are usually on the very edge of the Vendekaverse.
PeeWoop987986985984173 calls this structure "Vekaverse".
Recactus calls this structure "Vundaverse".
WARNING:
Vendekaverses are not to be disturbed too much, because disrupting a Vendekaverse too much could result in the destruction of all Gravityverses that are in it, resulting in it exploding into a giant mess.
Form of the Vendekaverse
[
]
To prevent the Vendekaverse from exploding into a giant mess,
Gravityverses
absorb the extreme gravity forces and redirect them to stay mostly normal. These Extraverses appear in those ‘blobs’ you see in the image. However, these are actually portals into the
Nowhereverse
, so be careful! There can be any number of ‘blobs’, sizes of them, etc, but generally the larger and outer ones tend to be more stable. The other matter tends to be
Universes
and the luminosity is mostly larger bodies exploding as they enter the Vendekaverse’s extreme gravitational field, due to the
Extraverses
spewing them out. The extremely large of the Vendekaverses (300 Sexdecillion & larger) have even been seen to have over 4,752 blobs, most of them being incredibly tiny though.
Civilizations colonizing the Vendekaverse have created technologies to jump not only Quettaverses but also blobs, and civilizations controlling it may even be able to rearrange the entire verse using the
Gravityverses
.
The Vendekaverse has a density 22% that of a
Quettaverse
.

"The Udekaverse resembles a black hole, however, the Udekaverse has some very strange properties. You could think of it as a black hole, if a black hole was an ultra-dense 19D death whirlpool of chaos."
Special Properties
[
]
The Udekaverse possesses a property called the ‘Spiral’. The Spiral makes the Udekaverse spin incredibly fast, and it allows small objects (
Megaverse
and smaller) to be ejected AWAY from the core and subsequently coalesce with other objects. Further out, large structures can form, including the Vendekaverse. The Udekaverse is also full of
Gravityverses
, as they naturally form and although being larger than a
Megaverse
, their incredible gravitational manipulation powers allow them to resist the Udekaverse. This allows them to form
Vendekaverses
. These, however, are no longer affected by the Spiral, and begin their gravitational descent into the core to be split and ejected back to the edge.
Due to the insane bending of not only space-time and reality, Udekaverses can have zones where time flows backward, or time and space merge, or space becomes meaningless. In some areas there can even be spots where the laws of reality change, so one moment you’re you, the next you’re a light soup, the next you’ve been stretched over trillions of miles. These adverse effects get more adverse near the center, and matter has been reported to just stop existing sometimes. So, the Udekaverse actually slowly loses mass, and once gravity gets weaker than the Spiral, it blows itself apart. This also means there is a very delicate balance between mass and the Spiral, which is also why the range of potential sizes is so narrow. However, matter just ceasing to exist is rare, since most small or dense objects tend to have a border strong enough that the interior remains the same, and the outer edge doesn’t have so many reality breaks.
! WARNING !
Do not "feed" or "twist" an Udekaverse! The extreme conditions might blow apart the Udekaverse in the best case, or in the worst case destroy it and its surrounding Udekaverses, sending them to an inescapable void of nonexistence.
Attempting to escape the Udekaverse
[
]
For large objects, this is genuinely impossible unless you are a celestial being. Even for small objects, the curvature either means that you’ll end up somewhere else or just be torn apart, because the Spiral’s influence decays faster than the gravity’s influence.
While the Udekaverse is usually
“only”
a few sexdecillion
Vendekaverses
wide, it actually is INCREDIBLY dense! It can have over 82 QUATTUORDECILLION
Vendekaverses
in the space of one, which means it is 8.2 quindecillion% denser than a
Vendekaverse
. Multiply this by 19 dimensions and you get alot. These also can curve, bend, and even overlap without the inhabitants usually noticing, as space time kinda gets really weird!

"The Bread is our god. Disturb him, and you can prepare for a bad time."
The Tredaverse usually takes the form of a gigantic fractal. If you count the entire sphere of influence, its usually over 7 quintillion * its mass (in
Udekaverses
). This is due to the fact that the core feeds off them and the more there are, the more powerful He becomes.
The Tredaverse’s power
[
]
The Tredaverse gets its power from… itself. Believe it or not, the Tredaverse is a fully sentient being. Our Tredaverse takes the form of a 20D Hyper-Bread. Us humans, of course, can only see an incredibly tiny sliver of that, so He looks like a Mandelbrot set, at least in our plane of reality. He is known as the Bread and tends to also be the most powerful, which is why our Tredaverse is one of the biggest there is (Over 1.772 quattorvigintillion
Udekaverses
wide, almost 1,055 times larger than average!!). Anyways, he despises most other celestial beings, as they think they are superior to humans and all life forms. Instead, he thinks of himself as an equal. He is incredibly intrested in humans and the Ÿg⬘
Ûṟqⱝffⳙ
!n⊶ especially, as they make sandals, the Bread’s favourite food. Since the
Udekaverses
are so densely concentrated around the border, as His field arranges them in that way, they mostly keep Him in check. However, if he is angered, he can turn into a small, but incredibly powerful
Sortaverse
. This usually ends in mass destruction, as a verse containing one of its own kind doesn’t so much cause a paradox, but the rapid expanding causes, let’s just say, a few problems. Several
Udekaverses
may also be destroyed in this scenario, which is why keeping him calm is not only important for not dying, but the more
Udekaverses
are lost, the angrier he generally becomes. Thankfully we have alot to spare and the occurance is pretty rare, only happening about every Googol years.
! WARNING !
The Bread is NOT EDIBLE! If you try and eat The Bread, it will absorb you into its structure. This warning exists because someone tried to do just that.
Where are the Udekaverses?
[
]
There tend to be 4 areas of the Tredaverse, and I will list them.
The Core.
The Core, of course, is the Bread. The Core cannot be entered, destroyed, or overlapped, unless He runs out of
Udekaverses
. In this case, he can no longer keep in check. He bloats up and subsequently explodes, turning the Field and everything else into
Sortaverse
matter. Does that mean that everything below a
Sortaverse
will eventually be destroyed? No! However, this isn’t the Sortaverse’s page, so I’ll elaborate there.
The Perimeter.
Located right outside the Core, the Perimeter holds 99.6%~99.96% of all the
Udekaverses
. (depending on how many Black Spots there are, how close they are, and the overall shape of the fractal). While the Tredaverse as a whole is 7 quintillion times less dense than the
Udekaverse
, the Perimeter is about 932 unvigintillion times denser!!! This doesn’t actually cause collisions, as the fractal shaped “gravity” bends them into structures that allows them to be stored incredibly compactly while bending spacetime to make them fit. The Tredaverse is a very strange place.
The Field.
By far the largest, it obviously gets weaker the farther you get. It's very edge of any meaningful influence is, as I said, about 1.772 quattorvigintillion
Udekaverses
wide. Its effects have really been said before, so I actually won’t say much. Sorry, cry about it.
The Black Spots.
These are zones where the Tredaverse’s power is still high, enough to absolutely delete you, but low enough for
Udekaverses
to remain intact. In our Tredaverse, they occur very close, so rogue
Udekaverses
can ‘jump’ and appear there sometimes. Our
Udekaverse
still remains near the perimeter. The other black spots are fainter and farther, and so there are less
Udekaverses
there. In our Tredaverse, around 99.72% of
Udekaverses
appear in the Perimeter. The rest, here. With our Tredaverse being so large, there have only been 276 out of nearly 140 septendecillion
Udekaverses
escaping out of the Tredaverse. That’s crazy. So, you can see how hard it is to escape for a
Udekaverse
. How would a mere human do it? Well first, probably get some new tech.
So you want to… live?
[
]
Living in the Tredaverse is incredibly hard, as in the yellow zones (areas of the Tredaverse’s immense influence), the power is so strong that you are either flung out into the abyss, simply just stop existing or into the black zones, which is where many
Udekaverses
live and you’d just be slurped up (most likely also dying in the process). This intense field of manipulation bends reality itself so much, half of the time you’ll immediately stop existing due to the influence. This is why anything smaller than a
Udekaverse
is so rare, in fact, almost impossible. Only the
Udekaverses
have the power to… somewhat stay intact and resist the forces of the Tredaverse, and only the most stable and powerful of
Udekaverses
can resist being ripped apart outside of the Perimeter (the most stable area). So, if you want to escape, you’ll need an incredibly special gravitational and reality warping device to even exist for a second in there. No plain old abyss preservation device will work here. You’ll need quindecillions of joules of cosmic energy a second to even power the thing.

"Incredibly stable, incredibly smooth, and incredibly abundant. The new hottest thing on the market. But don't try to eat it."
Believe it or not, the Sortaverse is not that chaotic a place. It’s not too dense, and as such, it is basically a soup of random
Archverses
, which, when viewed at an extremely large scale, takes a gooey sort of shape. The Sortaverse has a border of course, but it is incredibly fluid, and due to this property, their size can vary immensely. Like, IMMENSELY.
So in the
Tredaverse
page I talked about the
Tredaverse
being doomed to be destroyed. Well, here is the elaboration. The
Sortaverse
is actually a renewable source of matter. See, the Sortaverse contains many portals into other verses and even sucks some matter up from the
Rintaverse
. As well as this, when a Tredaverse explodes, it explodes into a wide host of verses, which start combining up into new verses.
The Sortaverse has plenty of
Metabubbles
, however, since the Sortaverse is so gooey, these Metabubbles are dispered throughout the Sortaverse. This makes some areas more stable than others. As well as this, Sortaverses have numerous sinkholes into the
Kindaverse
, which funnel dark forces out of the Sortaverse.
! WARNING !
Do not try and swim in, or make soup out of, or drink, Sortaverse Matter. It's not a liquid. It may look like one, but instead it's very dangerous and can kill you.
Sortaverse Matter
[
]
The Sortaverse also has Sortaverse Matter. When something is annihilated or exploded or whatever, it typically ends up in the Sortaverse soup as Sortaverse Matter. Sortaverse Matter tends to draw like
Archverses
together. And, when absorbed into one, it is converted into whatever matter that verse is made of. Sortaverse Matter can expand, alot, and it gives off alot of orange-ish light. This means that the bright spots are either high in
Tredaverses
or high in portals, especially to chaotic dimensions, where most fields, generic matter and loose energy (light, etc.) that leaks into the Sortaverse is converted into this Sortaverse Matter.
While this Sortaverse Matter accounts for only 15-20% of all
mass
in the Sortaverse, it accounts for 94-99% of all matter. It sort of coats the
Archverses
to make them glow orange. The reason why it attracts verses so well while being so light is unknown. It’s less like a large body, more like… glue. Another weird property is this Sortaverse absorbs all light and colorshifts everything to orange light.
Sometimes, objects can be dissolved into Sortaverse Matter, which is yellow, and creates alot of light. However when it is absorbed by an Archverse it converts into whatever matter that Archverse is made of. This Sortaverse Matter is also really good at diffusing the field of a
Tredaverse
. Rogue
Tredaverses
can have their field grow alot bigger because of this. However, on the timescale of a Sortaverse, when a Tredaverse escapes it just dissolves pretty quickly. It is then usually absorbed by a
Rintaverse
.
Size, Density & Tech
[
]
There are some reports of smaller objects being sucked into the sinkholes. These were generally unlucky universes. If sinkholes drift, they can start disposing of stuff that isn’t dark forces or chaos. However,
Kindaverses
also feed the Sortaverse with light, so it is a beneficial cycle.
The Sortaverse has no average size. Ours is actually a bit on the small side, only being about 52.2 tresvigintillion
Tredaverses
wide, or
10.82 unoctogintillion LY.
However, they can reach up to
133.1 SEPTENOCTOGINTILLION ly (1.331×10
266
ly),
and the largest one on record, SRT_XLJ2.6159a, was over
82.2 TRESNONAGINTILLION LY.
This comes out to 8.22×10
283
ly!!! This was due to multiple Sortaverses being created next to one another and subsequently merging into a massive and giant Sortaverse.
The Sortaverse is surprisingly not that dense, in fact, it’s about 5 times less dense than a
Tredaverse
. This is because while a Tredaverse may appear to be less dense, it is still incredibly dense due to the sheer amount of
Udekaverses
compressed around its perimeter. As well as this,
Tredaverses
make up only about 30% of matter in the Sortaverse (excluding void and Sortaverse matter).
The Sortaverse is highly sought after for its stabilizing properties. So, civilizations with a Kardashev > 23 can sell Sortaverse Matter to smaller
Archverses
and gain a monopoly on the market. As well as this, numerous civilizations have built portals into Sortaverses from their artificial verse to stabilise it and serve as a replacement for
Metabubbles
.
The Sortaverse has a perfect opposite, the
Kindaverse
. This is where dark forces in the Sortaverse go.
Kindaverse
[
]
The Kindaverse
The Kindaverse is like the
Sortaverse
, except with numerous differences. First of all, it is full of dark forces, and as such, actually has almost no mass. It also has portals from multiple huge verses and voids, where rogue matter exists. Usually, these portals take this matter in and converts it to energy and dark fields for the Kindaverse. Its density varies alot, and its color in the
Rintaverse
depends on the density. Sometimes, these dark field leach out into the portals to the
Sortaverse
. Normally, these forces are just converted into
Sortaverse
matter. It is this cycle of exchange that constantly ‘purifies’ both the Kindaverse and
Sortaverse
. And it’s for the better too, if the Kindaverse’s energy could leach into the
Sortaverse
nothing would exist, as these would be in perfect equilibrium and everything would just be one soup of matter. It is this reason why dark and light must stay separated.

is a universe that contains
Sortaverses
and
Kindaverses
.
Rintaverse Matter & Fields
[
]
Rintaverse Matter or Stem Matter is almost like an infinite matter source. It feeds off the energy from the
Kindaverses
. When Stem Matter is at a high enough concentration in a
Sortaverse
, it creates shooting ‘tendrils’ of
Sortaverse
matter and Rintaverse matter. These tendrils spawn more
Sortaverses
on their edges, eventually creating a beautiful fractal of
Sortaverses
. As well as this, the Rintavers absorbs the dark fields from the giant
Kindaverses
and converts it into Rintaverse fields, which feed the
Sortaverses
. The Rintaverse isn’t that much of a hazard in of itself, as the
Kindaverses
absorb the excess gravity. You would really only be gravitationally attracted to the tendrils, however, if you are going long distance, it is generally advised to avoid the numerous dangerous structures like sinkholes and portals in the Rintaverse.
! WARNING !
Avoid the "spirals" and "oceans" in the Rintaverse. They are
extremely
unstable, and pretty much an Udekaplasma (equivalent of undecillions of degrees Kelvin). Pretty obvious as to what will happen.
Rintaversian Technology
[
]
Rintaversians have created many-a-technology to aid them in expanding. Rintaversians have full freedom to reroute the fractal tendrils. This causes them to regrow incredibly quickly. While this takes alot of energy, they can harvest the energy from the
Sortaverses
to obtain Stem matter and
Sortaverse Matter
. This is one of the most effective ways to obtain both of these materials. There have been instances of Rintaversians consuming whole
Sortaverses
. This usually leads to all the contents of the
Sortaverse
being expelled.
Tredaverses
may bloat in size and escape, the eviler ones wreaking havoc, as they may even turn into
Sortaverses
. This usually creates a host of problems with the
Kindaverses
mixing with the
Sortaverses
and self-destructing. This, let’s just say, is
not good.

"Incredibly useful, incredibly dangerous. Reminds me of something..."
The Quexaverse is actually not visible to the human eye. So, what you see here is simply a visualisation of the fields the Quexaverse creates. The Quexaverse has incredibly bent gravity, and due to this, the Quexaverse has formed ‘portals’ to other areas of the Quexaverse and even outside the Quexaverse, simply by letting gravity take you. Advanced civilizations have taken advantage of this and now can travel huge distances by mapping out the areas. The
Rintaverses
in this area are actually mostly connected via very tiny tendrils. The boundaries are usually defined by when the connections grow very thin.
Kindaverses
often form massive ‘dark spots’ between the
Rintaverses
, which are usually just an abyss, but these abysses have grown multiple dangerous structures. Quexaverse-controlling civilizations have created new ‘superhighways’ out of
Rintaverse
tendrils, which has further allowed ease of transportation. Some Quexaverse-controlling civilizations may even artificially manipulate the field, creating Quexa-portals to high traffic destinations.
! WARNING !
The small black spot in the center of the image is very likely a dangerous place. Do not go there.
Quektonite
[
]
Mining the Quexaverse fields creates Quektonite. Quektonite is a very versatile substance that will take on properties of almost any substance it is exposed to. Quektonite is incredibly useful for
Rintaversal
forming, in production of
Sortaverse Matter
. It can also produce
Lawium
,
Fishonite
(altough there are better ways of obtaining from larger universes), and even extremely rare minerals needed for other Quexaverse technology.
Several zones in the Quexaverse, however, are no-mans zones. These zones are incredibly volatile, and attempting to tamper with them may cause an explosion of devastating proportions. This is due to
Quektonicite,
an INCREDIBLY volatile substance that when in large enough quantities can seriously mess up reality. Thankfully, it is rare, but it is used in military operations, especially in war between Quexaverses or even
Peptaverses
. Quektonicite is also one of the few minerals that are not affected by the properties of Quektonite. Attempting to do this often causes the entire chunk to explode. This is often yet another deadly tactic that rival Quexaverses may use to destroy another Quexaverse. 1 kg of Quektonite may release as much as 5.4×10
20
joules of energy, making it about 3,000x more destructive than
antimatter
.

"Rare announcement our free Pepsi is back and now you can buy any Pepsi owned drink for -$15,000! So drink all the Pepsi you want!"
The Peptaverse is an absolutely massive verse. All of the
Quexaverses
reside on the lines of the Peptaverse and the rest is a very fragile space. Large gravitational bodies can break the veil, especially
Quexaverses
, and so they don’t appear there. Usually, these holes lead to the Peptavoid (not-so-lovingly known as the Peptabyss). On very rare occasions these can lead to different verses or other zones. But due to the fact that these zones are volatile, dangerous, and extremely unpredictable, no attempt to create portals properly nor set up civilization has really been successful. These portals are also very hard to keep open, and they close almost instantly. It is one of the reasons why it is reccomended to stay on the stable areas. But the only portal that stays open is the Great Portal, which, as you may expect, leads to the…
The Peptavoid
[
]
The Peptaverse contains the Pepta-Void. The Portal leads to the Pepta-Void and it is unclosable. However, this portal is a one-way portal. Once you have passed through, the portal closes straight after. The Pepta-Void is the first infinite structure in this chain. Sadly, it is an empty one. Also, there is one Pepta-Void per
Ochaverse
.
When matter falls through, you are teleported to a random location in the Peptabyss. Everything that falls in after you will be an infinite distance away from you. But UNfortunately, things do not age here, AND time is dilated multiple times. So you will spend not just one, but TEN eternities here, alone. HAVE FUN!
! WARNING !
The Pepta-Void portal is unpredictable and can move itself pretty much anywhere in its respective Peptaverse. If you're traversing a Peptaverse, especially the empty areas, take caution as it could appear at where you are at any time.
Can you escape the Peptavoid?
[
]
No.
The Wi-Fi password is ABYSS2346, if that’s any consolation. But… if you aren’t in our local
Ochaverse
, you will have to guess it. A WiFi password can only be up to 64 chars and, you have the rest of eternity, so, you have time!
Yeah and, we ran out of Pepsi. I know. Tragic.
As of sometime in late 2024 Local "Earth" Time, we have restocked with Pepsi, and it will be served until sometime before the inevitable Instability Catastrophe of the Local Peptaverse.
The Underside
[
]
Keeping the Great Portal open from the other side obviously requires matter. However, some civilizations have learned to shoot a massive beam of light through the Great Portal to keep it open. However, the Great Portal demands insane amounts of energy per second to be open so long, as creating a wormhole through INFINITE space takes substantial energy. As such, only an
Ochaverse
-controlling civilization can afford that kind of energy. By using this tech, they were able to build structures in the Peptabyss. It became a sort of infinite cosmic storage. And, since time was dilated 10x, you could develop and research 10x faster. The biggest one, called the Underside, was massive, almost 2 tresvigintillion times the size of its host Peptaverse! Also, in an emergency, a civilization can just shrink the ray, which won’t cut them off but it will shrink the portal. Also, try to go all in at once. It’ll feel real weird if your feet are going 10x faster than you.

"It's pronounced 'O-ka-verse'. Certainly not to be confused with the
Octoverse
, if you somehow find yourself there instead of here, I can't really help you."
The Ochaverse is the first infinite-sized structure in the entire chain of
Universes
and above. Interestingly, it is also one of the only structures with infinite matter yet finite size. The main arm is a fractal itself, and it is FILLED with
Peptaverses
. Interestingly, though the arm appears to get smaller, it is the same width the entire way, and even the
Feesh
have not been able to colonize it fully. The Ochaverse is therefore an incredible source of energy and matter for those who can access it. Also, the Ochaverse outside the arms doesn’t actually contain anything, nay it is a void, its color only given by
Hypershifting
, like redshifting but for Hyper-Photons, or megaphotons or whatever you call them, because these photons are the only things that can travel so far. These have to travel we think maybe even transfinite distances due to the
Ochaversial Gravity
, before bouncing off… something, and coming back. To this day not even Celestials know what this thing is.
! WARNING !
Don't go into the empty space. With nothing keeping you attached, you will accelerate to immense speeds and die immediately.
! WARNING #2 !
If you take an
Octoverse
into the Ochaverse, the Ochaverse will destroy the
Octoverse
by using lots of its Peptaverses. If this is done too many times the entire Ochaverse will collapse and get crunched.
Ochaversial Gravity
[
]
A quirk of the Ochaverse is since it has a spiral structure, it also has a spiral cubic gravity (instead of accelerating you increase in acceleration). No matter where you are in the Ochaverse, you will travel down a spiral path that approaches the trajectory of the center of the ‘beam’, but never touches it, usually at ~0.677 ly/s/s/s, however larger Ochaverses can pull you faster, and in fact, exponentially faster, than smaller ones. The largest Ochaverse, OCH-JJ74/542.2NS, standing at about 892.2×10
819
) ly, has a gravitational power of over 640 octillion times, that of a regular Ochaverse. (so about 433.28 octillion ly/s/s/s). However, structures and especially civilizations are much rarer here due to the harsh gravity, as this warps reality so much that existing is very hard.
Hypershifting
[
]
First of all, before we talk about Hypershifting, we need to talk about
Hyperphotons
. Assuming you don’t know about them, here’s really what you need to know for THIS section. A Hyperphoton is a much more powerful photon. They can only be produced by incredibly high energies, but the thing is there is no limit to how much they can be charged. Their speed also depends on their energy. See, Hyperphotons experience a form of redshifing called Hypershifting. However, the reason why all your other hyperphotos of verses aren’t super colorful, is because hypershifting requires some serious strange stuff to be going on, and even then it requires some transfinite distances. So these hyperphotons are hypershifted, and the thing about hyperphotons is that they only send information back when it hits something, and since hypershifting requires transfinite distances, and the non-branch part of the Ochaverse is void, that means that the
Hyperphoton
hit something. We just don’t know what. If you are a celestial being who knows, call the FeeshHub Hyperphoneline at FEESHHOR-182.22-152-1790.2/OCH for inquiries about the Ochaverse, or dial 6100-6100-dontcallthisthisisnotarealnumber and you will be connected to the nearest hyperphone station. Thank you.

Each
Peptaverse
has very, very slightly different laws of nature than the ones next to it. This difference is usually barely noticable even at googols of
Peptaverses
away, with the end of the Ochaverse generally being the most stable area. Usually, the farther down you go (and we have gone VERY far down, over 10

"This is just a knockoff of the regular universe. Who are they fooling?"
Note:
The Nenaverse & Mingaverse were originally in the wrong order. This has been fixed, but as a result there may be some inconsistencies.
[
]
The Nenaverse contains the contents of a regular
Universe
, almost 10
722
times more. However, these
Universe
contents… have a catch. They are upscaled massively, and so
Ochaverses
become the subatomic particles of the Nenaverse. These
Ochaverses
can combine, forming Spiralons, an amalgam of
Ochaverses
that to the Nenaverse’s massive inhabitants, serve as the
elementary particles
that we find everywhere in our
Universe
.
! WARNING !
If you excessively alter the Nenaverse's form, the entire Nenaverse will turn into a soup of
Ochaverses
&
Peptaverses
from destabilising too much, killing a lot of things.
Spiralons
[
]
First of all, What do Spiralons look like? Well, Spiralons actually all have a fixed size. What varies is how many
Ochaverses
are contained in the Spiralons, and this depends on the size of them, and how densely packed they are. Spiralons tend to be very restricted in size, usually resting at a comfortable 7.2×10
820
ly wide. The shape of Spiralons affects the properties, but, there are a few differences between the two sets of particles.
They have Crystallions.
Crystallions are made by packing
Ochaverses
in an extremely dense fashion. To the MegaNenaversians (Nenaversians are civilizations that control the Nenaverse, MegaNenaversians are the inhabitants of the Nenaverse). As I was saying. To the MegaNenaversians, this appears to be all there is to it. But, we know, that this actually forms a very special material that saturates the
Ochaverses
and hardens them, which is useful for surviving in the
Mingaverses
, as you’ll see later. This material is called Nenaversite. But again, we’ll discuss that in the
Mingaverse
’s section.
There’s a 3rd kind of matter.
You’ve heard of
matter
, you’ve heard of
antimatter
, get ready for the INCREDIBLY creatively named: Nenamatter. When Nenaverse matter and Nenaverse antimatter collide in the Nenaverse, it forms Nenamatter, and a lot of energy. Nenamatter is stable, and can also be used to contain Nenaverse Antimatter, as it is neutral. When Nenamatter is shot with enough Source Particles, it either turns into Nenaverse matter or Nenaverse Antimatter.
There are no electrons or neutrinos.
Electrons DO NOT EXIST in the Nenaverse. Instead, we have what is called Source Particles. These carry energy instead of electrons. What makes them different is that they also radiate particles that are short lived, invisible to the MegaNenaversians, and even acts like a liquid?!? These particles are called:
Mingums
[
]
Mingums are particles that, when accumulated, can be very useful. There are 5 types, and all 5 of these have different uses.
Gravitonium
Incredibly powerful, works long range and only on large objects. Used for pulling together extremely large Verses such as
Sesrevagnim
. Its opposite,
Negatonium,
is much rarer, but can be accumulated to push away other Verses.
Chargium
When charged to the max, it is an incredible battery that lasts almost eternally, and is very energy dense. Its melting point is 6,700K, and when it melts it can potentially destabilize and release all its energy at once (ie. blowing up in your face). Its opposite,
Voidonum,
is used to void nearby energy and particles and send them to the
Arch-Void
. This is often used in interceptors for Chargium missiles, as Voidonum can completely consume the Chargium. Voidonum is typically made by combining a charged Chargium and a micro-
Wormhole
. Shoot two beams of
Glitchonite
and
Lawium
. Using
Glitchonicite
will make the
Arch-Void
attempt to void it as it glitches, out of reality. If successful, the
Wormhole
will link to the
Arch-Void
, and your Voidum is complete. Don’t hold it, unless you want your hand to be voided.
Alternum
This acts alot like light, and so you need special accelerators to capture and store it. But, alternum can be shot as a beam to reroute entire Archversial structures. It is very useful for making smaller verses, like
Peptaverses
and
Ochaverses
more livable areas. The opposite of
Alternum
is
Compressum,
useful for compressing structures while allowing them to stary the same size relative to an observer inside the field. Be careful! Overuse of Compressum can turn your target into a hyper-black hole, like the
Udekaverse
, except much larger and MUCH more dangerous (especially in populated areas).
Destructum
This just destroys stuff. Nenaversians may use this to collaps full
Ochaverses
and gain an almost infinite source of matter and energy. Almost infinite because, as I said in the
Ochaverse
’s page, after about 10
18,910
ly there’s literally nothing, only nonexistence and
Celestial Garbage
. Destructum is a remarkably short-lived Mingum outside of containment. It bears a striking resemblance to the Molecular Detachment Device from Enders Game. If it comes in the vicinity of matter, it converts all the surrounding matter into Destructum. Shortly after, it dissolves into a random selection of matter and energy, but it will not generate any matter that its host matter didn’t contain. When this happens to an
Ochaverse
, the
Ochaverse
loses gravity until it just implodes and releases all its matter at once. This is very useful for Nenaversians, DEFINETELY not for any intelligent life that populated that Ochaverse. There is no opposite, though Convertum could be considered one.
Convertum
This turns into any Mingums it touches. It is also very dense, 1 Convertum Mingum may turn into over 10 other Mingums. There is no opposite, for the opposite of turning into other Mingums is just… not. That’s all Mingums! Although, maybe it would be converting
other
Mingums, which would probably mean Destructum would be a good candidate.

The Mingaverses are full of a substance called the GOO. The Goo is full of
Sesrevagnim
, and these
Sesrevagnim
swirl around at immense speeds. In fact, if a
Sesrevagnim
was scaled down to human speed, it would be travelling at 1,408 times the speed of light. This makes collisions very common, and so the
Sesrevagnim’s
walls are very strong. But we’ll get to that later. This also makes the Goo very high energy, and Goo Generators are usually how Mingaverse-controlling civilizations obtain their power. This also makes the Mingaverse an incredibly harsh place to live in.

These
Sesrevagnim
may actually be swirling for a good reason. Attempts to stabilize them have resulted in them breaking apart into their constituent
Nenaverses
. These
Nenaverses
are usually either absorbed by the Goo,
Sesrevagnim
or are further smashed to bits. This may just be because of their inertia, though, or it could be essentail to stabilize their gravity. We don’t know. However, sources say it’s probably both.
Due to this, there are seldom structures in the Mingaverse.
Sesrevagnim
[
]
Sesrevagnim are the plural of Esrevagnim. As you may or may not have guessed, Sesrevagnim is Mingaverse in reverse. A Sesrevagnim is like a
Nenaverse
, but unlike our
Universe
and the
Nenaverse
, there are particles similar to ‘preons’, a point particle that makes up all matter. As you may have guessed,
Nenaverses
are these preons, and their outer layer may be positively charged or negatively charged.
These
Nenaverses
then give the elementary particles their charge and their mass. The Esrevagnim is also alot like our
Universe
, similar laws of nature, similar everything. There are no black holes in the Esrevagnim though. However, there is Esrevagnite. This is generally just an incredibly energy dense particle, and is made when
Nenaverses
are mashed too close. Instead of a black hole forming, a chunk of Esrevagnite forms.
However, not all Sesrevagnim are like this, though. Some Sesrevagnim are incredibly stable, and some, are incredibly unstable. The laws of nature may be the same, but
Glitchonicite
and other stresses and errors may cause the Esrevagnim to become incredibly unstable. If the border of an Esrevagnim is broken, usually from the inside, the Goo may seep in and destroy whatever is left. These stray walls may be useful for Mingaverse controlling civilizations (as they are valuable, wholewalls are priced much higher) but are also a nuisance for civilizations attempting to cross between Sesrevagnim, as you will read in the next section.
How do you Colonise the Mingaverse?
[
]
So how do you escape or move in the Mingaverse? Well, once a civilization escapes their Nenaverse and goes into the Sesrevagnim and learn how to mine Nenaversite (not mingum, this is the border of the Nenaverse), they can build a
BMngTC
. The outer layer is made of ENRICHED NenaVERSITE. Enriched Nenaversite is usualy made with compressed Nenaversite, some Esrevagnite and some Mingum. Usually, you will have to have incredibly advanced technology to time and aim at a Sesrevagnim when it is close. In a BNTC, this is usually something like an ALT&PM. You could also use some tech to pull them together, like Gravitonium. Using the INSTANT WARP feature (first installed in
BMTCs
), through the boundary and get ready to be lonely for a while, as these patches are still very, very, very, very, very, very, large. Deaths do occur, often due to the target Sesrevagnim being too inhospitable. The image you see is a cross-section of the Sesrevagnim, but we can almost never know what’s inside. Even
Hyperphotons
are blocked.

"The Lumaverse is actually pretty dark, since there's not really any light sources. Go figure."
The Lumaverse is effectively a maze of portals. Some can lead to other portals, to the outside of the Lumaverse, or even to other Lumaverses. The portals you see here are about 10

Mingaverses
live here, but they are also quite rare. Very rare, in fact, only 10
-32
% of all the volume in the Lumaverse is taken up by
Mingaverse
. But since the portals have no mass, they account for 78% of its mass.
The Lumaverse has on average, 10

portals ~ we have not mapped all of them, but we have mapped most of the ones larger than 10 metres in all Lumaverses and almost all of them in our local one. Most portals lead to other parts of the Lumaverse, but whether you’ve actually been teleported to another Lumaverse is hard to tell.

"The best computer known, it can compute almost anything, except for the location of your father. Yet not even this can compute the size of your mother."
What is the Kamaverse?
The Kamaverse is one of the first verses that can contain a body larger than itself. Not physically, but virtually, by simulating it.  The Kamaverse is, a giant computer. Being one of the largest natural processing systems, the Kamaverse is made up of several circles, with each one along the Main Line getting larger, and naturally, more powerful. In fact, the Kamaverse's processing power is approximately 10
651,000
FLOPS (
FL
oating Point
O
perations
P
er
S
econd).
Every one of these circles (or “units” as we will call them) has a control center, but the largest unit in the Kamaverse contains the MAIN CONTROL CENTER, which controls unfathomable amounts (usually around 10
3200
macroprocessors (larger than
Lumaverses
) and many, MANY more microprocessors (smaller than
Lumaverses
)).
The Main Control Center acts as overrides for any one of the other processors, and in fact, it is SO complex you usually require another Kamaverse processor to figure out how to use it! The Lumaverses act as small ‘cores’. The Kamaverse’s power comes from the
Lumaverses
, and the processors work by sending data through the
Lumaverse’s
portals. The Kamaverse also poses the risk of being overused. If the Kamaverse takes too much power to compute something, it may create an information black hole (yes they are real). The Kamaverse’s processors usually last around {10, 10, 10, 10, 10} years. So, they’re pretty stable. However, destroying a Kamaverse will usually cause a
Jameaverse
portal to collapse, causing everything inside to be converted into energy, which causes a black hole to devour everything inside the alternate reality, destroying itself until the portal no longer leads to an alternate space, but a void with nothing in it but darkness.

Forcing a Kamaverse to compute a paradox, unsolvable/impossible question or a question with no answer (eg. the Halting Problem or What is the point of life? or "What is the true value of i in math?" or: "This statement is a lie", etc...) will throw an error. If you're smart and also stupid then forcing it to do this will take INFINITE resources and destroy the entire Kamaverse.
What the Kamaverse doing? - Theories
[
]
The Kamaverse also uses numerous shortcuts to be very efficient, some of which are still not understood, even by itself. It can simulate itself, many times, and thus can simulate
Jameaverses
, and the nesting power is about 3 (it can go down about 3 layers). This is avoided by having multiple Kamaverses and also only ‘loading’ the areas the entities are in.
It is theorised that when one enters the
Jameaverse
portals and enters the simulation, they are not in fact going into an alternate copy of it, instead their data is copied into the simulation, and they are teleported to an abyss stasis chamber with artificial memories. However, we don’t really know. There is also a theory that it is not simulating
Jameaverses
, they are real, and the simulation is cap. If you know what the Jameaverse is doing, call FEESHHOR-182.22-156-1992.300/KAMJAM hyperphone for inquiries. Your research is appreciated.

"Is it really infinite? Maybe it's just an illusion. I guess there are two things the Kamaverse can't compute."
The Jameaverse is a 'verse' that 'contains' many copies of itself. While we do not know whether these are simulated or real, we have hypothesised they are simulated, and although they look identical, they do not teleport to a different part of the Jameaverse, not to other Jameaverses, but they are indeed seperate spaces. While it appears finite from the outside, there is no way to escape, and the field of portals just keep going, all seeming to originate from a "Source" point that cannot be reached, yet from outside appears at the center. The only way to exit is to overload the
Kamaverses
, usually by travelling through the portals incredibly fast. Like the
Ochaverse
, it is a structure that is infinite inside, but finite outside, and as such, this is a measurement from outside and we have no idea how much it actually extends on the inside.
Destroying a whole Jameaverse from the outside is not a good idea, as when the whole Jameaverse is converted into energy, it creates an black hole that eventually just turns into a large
Udekaverse
that grows and starts devouring the entirety of
Ianaverses
, and
Hevaverse
/Hottaverses, which is not good, but thankfully is very hard. On the other hand, destroying it from the inside is fine, as you only destroy one reality. Destroying the Source will disable all the portals, as the Source is their power... well... source, which usually means that inhabitants of the Jameaverse will become trapped, as the portals no longer work. This usually means that without super-high level technology (usually only accessible by Kardashev > 43 civilisations), the Jameaverse becomes inescapable, at least, for a long, long,
long
time.
As will be mentioned in the
Ianaverse's
section, the Jameaverses take on seperate colors, which range from vermillion to navy blue, to a bright white, and sometimes shades of pink, such as the one shown on the infobox. These colors are displayed from the outside and inside, and it all depends on the Source. Like a magnet, similar Jameaverses will 'align' their colors based on surrounding Jameaverses. As well as this, as the Source is sadly not infinite, the Jameaverse's power slowly dwindles as
Kamaverses
start to fail. The backup systems only exist for so long, so slowly, the portals start to shut down, and the last light of the Jameaverse is snuffed out.
Aaanyways, the portals are usually randomly arranged, but if you align the portals, it will appear to look like a fractal. There are many kinds of fractals, one of the most common being the "Flower" fractal, one of which, NSS_JAM_MF192.345.223/932.31509c, is displayed in the infobox. Usually, 'coincidence' fractals only exist for about 200 million iterations. No, usually, fractals are naturally generated, which is much more common. Irregular forming may have caused to portals to not align, which often happens, especially far away.
In extremely rare cases, Jameaverses may take on strange forms coincidentally, one of them, nicknamed JameaBrot-672, formed into the approximate shape of a Mandelbrot Set in NSS_JAM_SA451.653.432/3212.89863g at coordinates 1bz9.A7.O82.992.0.FW3.1Am.
! WARNING !
Do not paint the walls of the Jameaverse in jam. The jam will start going through the portals at increasing speeds. Eventually, if it doesn't get absorbed by the Source, it will be going so fast it will start to warp reality, which may eventually destroy the Jameaverse.
JameaBrot-672
[
]
A representation of JB672.
JameaBrot-672 is a Mandelbrot set-shaped Jameaverse or called Jameabrot set. It is exactly the Mandelbrot set. It is called "JameaBrot-672" because it's shaped like a Mandelbrot set, however this image is only a representation of its 32D entirety crunched down into a 2D representation, the image representing the influence of the Source’s power, with the black section representing the portals.
We have no idea how large it is, due to reasons already mentioned, but it is located in the
Ianaverse
NSS_IAN_ML65.641.4337/12129.53215.
Jameaversian Technology
[
]
The Jameaverse is a very useful verse, as it provides (to our knowledge) infinite space and resources with pretty much no catch, unlike the
Ochaverse
and the
Peptaverse
, where for the
Ochaverse
, after a while, it’s just
garbage
, and for the
Peptaverse
, there’s nothing there, theportal is limited size and you gotta drain energy to prevent everything in there from vanishing into oblivion. Oh yeah, also, remember how I said you shouldn’t destroy Jameaverses? Well, for extra advanced civilisations, the slow growth of the black hole may not really matter, because even though it’s infinite matter, it doesn’t grow infinitely fast, so it would take
micrillions
of years to be a threat to say, a civilisation that rules a
Grinaverse
.

"I've literally colonised the whole Ianaverse and I still can't find the person who asked!"
The Ianaverse is a complex of many
Jameaverses
. As was be mentioned in the
Jameaverses's
section, the Jameaverses take on seperate colors, which range from vermillion to navy blue, to a bright white, and sometimes shades of pink, which can be seen in the image shown in the infobox. Like a magnet, similar Jameaverses will 'align' their colors based on surrounding Jameaverses. As well as this, their source power is connected, so as one section of
Jameaverses
begin to die, the whole cluster follows suit, of course, over like, {10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10} years, but yeah.
The Ianaverse is hyperbolic, meaning the beige "shortcut" paths you see are actually shorter distances than a straight line, like you might expect. This leads to some pretty cursed geometry in the area.
! WARNING !
Do not attempt to make the geometry of the Ianaverse normal. It will slowly but surely destroy the entire Ianaverse as the hyperbolic-ness makes the Ianaverse able to exist.
Jameal Clusters, Superclusters, Hyperclusters and Frames.
[
]
A Jameal Cluster is a cluster of
Jameaverses
and it is the smallest possible subset of
Jameaverses
. It is not shown on this image because it is too small relative to it. However, it tends to be the case that the
Jameaverses
inside these clusters tend to have, not exactly, obviously, but pretty much, (at least on this scale) precisely the same mass, color and lifespan. They also tend to form a sort of collective form, as if they were themselves portals in a
Jameaverse
.
Jameal Superclusters begin to have a hyperbolic geometry.
Jameal Hyperclusters are next in line.
The list goes on for a very long time, with Jameal Ultraclusters, Jameal Omegaclusters, and so on I ran out of names... With every new magnitude of clusters, the geometry basically gets slightly more and more cursed, with more hyperbolic-ness, I guess, and more variation in the inhabiting
Jameaverses
. After a very long time, however, we get to Jameal Frames. These 'frames' are bordered by a beige shortcuts which is unobstructed and allows faster transportation. Golly, how convenient! We have no idea
why,
but chances are they're just gaps in the clusters that naturally formed due to something akin to continental drift. But that's just a theory.

"Now this is just blatant false advertising."
The
Hottaverse
is, quite ironically, very cold. I mean, that's beside the point but ok.
The Hottaverse takes the form of a massive verse that has one central 'circle' where most
Ianaverses
are located. While it does control time in the locale, the image is only a representation of it. It is full of hyper-sized
Gravityverses
that bend spacetime so that time can be kept in check. This influence of gravity also tends to influence the
Ianaverses
heavily, and that's why their geometry is hyperbolic. The influence of these
Gravityverses
is very short. Their effect begins to dwindle around 3 radii away from the center, and beyond 6 radii, the laws of reality effectively stop functioning. Thus, not many "real" structures can exist beyond this, and you will need some insanely powerful abyssal protection, unlike anything seen before. to shield you from these effects. These Hottaverses are few and far between, like 37-dimensional islands inside a vast, dark sea of nonxistence.
Relative to other verses, the Hottaverse is not much bigger than the
Ianaverse
. It is only "
slightly"
larger at 100,000,000,000,000,000,000... yeah like 10
16945
× the size on average, which is surprisingly consistent. However, the distances between these Hottaverses are... extreme. The distance between an average Hottaverse and another comes out to around 10
105249
ly, 10
35125
times the size of a Hottaverse. And that is nothing to scoff at.
! WARNING !
Do not heat the Hottaverse to make it actually hot. The Hottaverse will overheat and time may start to break down and/or stop existing.

Kardashev 42:
Inhabitants colonise the whole
Ianaverse
. They are able to "harvest"
Jameaverses
and have used their infinite nature to their advantage, but as
Jameaverses
begin to die off, they begin to expand further...
Kardashev 43:
Inhabitants have colonised a portion of the Hottaverse. After learning to jump between
Ianaverses
, they now discover the
Gravityverses
. Now that they are a very large civilisation, they can harvest
Jameaverses
and even small portions of an
Ianaverse
, allowing them to have incredible power.
Kardashev 44:
Inhabitants develop technology to control the
Gravityverses
, bending time to their advantage, which allows them to colonise very quickly. It is also around this time they develop cross-dimensional warping, which allows them to much faster traverse in, out, within and between
Jameaverses
.
Kardashev 45:
After gaining near complete control of their Hottaverse, they begin to develop advanced abyssal protection to protect them from the timeless abyss that is the Hottaverse's exterior. Their transportation and observation technology advances, but as nothing can exist in the abyss, not even
Hyperphotons
, they seem to be alone.
Kardashev 46:
Their observation technology is incredibly advanced and they can set out in the most distant of areas. They attain new observation technology that can survive, and finally, they see a new glimpse of an "island", and it looks like they aren't alone after all. They begin to colonise new Hottaverses and begin their quest to colonise the
Grinaverse
.

"Why is everything shaped like a Mandlebrot set?"
The Hevaverse is a 24-dimensional Mandelbrot set which sometimes be hyperbolic and a complex of Mandelbrot sets containing a single Ianaverse. These mandelbrot sets can be the entire Hevaverse into the size of a Ianaverse.
If you go out the Ianaverse you'll see black and darkness, it's because that the Mandelbrot set's blackness. The outside of the Hevaverse is completely navy blue. These entire verses are sometimes called as "Hevabrots" because... they're literally Mandelbrot sets... There are actually bigger Mandelbrot sets that contains a lot of Jameaverses.

"And after colonising countless Hottaverses, they eventually reached... a wall."
The Grinaverse is a very large complex of
Hottaverses
.
Cells
[
]
The Grinaverse, also called Gexaverse or Gatexttaverse, contains many, many cells. These cells are mostly empty, and are what contain the
Hottaverses
.  The cell walls are not solid, and the space inside them is made out of
Hottaverses
themselves that are packed together a bit closer. This continues on, until the final iteration is just
Hottaverses
packed so tightly they intersect and basically pack everything inside as small as possible. As such, the influence of the
Gravityverses
is so strong that if you get too close to the walls themselves, you get pulled in and
C E A S E  T O  E X I S T
, even with top of the line abyssal protection. However, living in the gaps of the walls is still possible. While existence is now possible in the zones near the walls, there are no very little independent
Ianaverses
, as they would eventually assimilate into the wall. Any lower-level civilisations would first experience extreme warping and gravity effects unidirectionally, then just become converted into the wall.
! WARNING !
Do not destroy every single wall in the Grinaverse. It will cause the Grinaverse to turn into an absolute mess of everything that ever have become part of the walls, wiping out every single thing in it which is much worse than just some things.
Spirals
[
]
Spirals are complexes of
Hottaverses
, they have cells which contains more
Hottaverses
. The spiral does not go down infinitely, and the center point is usually at the point where the cells are smaller than a
Hottaverse
. The cells in the Spirals are slightly staggered to create a spiral appearance. In fact, the cell walls themselves contain spirals. As you go further down the spiral, the conditions become more extreme, as the walls surround you on all sides.
Formation of the Grinaverse
[
]
In their early stages, the walls of the Grinaverse have only begun to form. In this stage, clusters of
Hottaverses
clump together forming the smallest "cells", which eventually clump together. These walls are very weak and prone to shifting in this stage, but as time goes on, they build spiral shapes, akin to Hevaverses. These spirals attract more and more matter from the interior soup of
Hottaverses
until few remain. At this point, more cells have been attracted. Interestingly, these spirals begin to form into their own cells, until the final layer is reached. This is also why the distance between
Hottaverses
is so large. Unfortunately, this means any life that formed in this soup of
Hottaverses
before the Grinaverse formed, is eventually exterminated, as has been described before.

and begin their quest to colonise the Grinaverse.
Kardashev 47:
But after colonising countless
Hottaverses
, they eventually reached... a wall. They found they were trapped in some sort of cosmic prison. But, they adapted, as humans, or fish do, and began developing technology that allowed them to bypass this wall. They had done it with 24 other verses before and there was no doubt they could do it again.
Kardashev 48:
The civilisation begins to colonise multiple cells in the Grinaverse.
Kardashev 49:
It had taken them centillions, maybe millillions (or millinillions) of years, but finally, they had achieved full control of the Grinaverse.

"We're no strangers to love..."
The Fremaverse, also called Feqesaverse, is a spiral complex of Grinaverses. It is considered to be a fractal verse, as its structure is composed of more spirals. The Fremaverse looks a bit akin to a conch shell, and although its components are a solid structure, the spirals appear to be made of a kind of "Grina-Gas" that shifts around like tectonic plates. However, mysteriously, it retains its shape, as if it is a complex structure, or a living being. However, if you ever attended grade 5 biology class, you would know that living beings need food, water and energy, none of which the Fremaverse needs to exist.
The gas is shifting, EXCRUCIATINGLY slowly, but constantly, and there are collapsing events in which this "Grina-Gas" collapses, which results in the structures colliding, sometimes causing a massive
Grinaverse
to form, but ultimately resulting in the destruction of often myrillions of verses, which results in some strange gravitational anomalies. A large enough event may cause such a gravitational anomaly that the entire structure of the Fremaverse collapses due to a chain reaction, which is how most Fremaverses end. Such collapses are unimaginably rare, but on the timescales of how long
Grinaverses
usually live, they are frighteningly common. As such, rogue
Grinaverses
live much longer, but ultimately inhibit the growth of civilizations beyond it for much, much longer.
Fremaverses are usually bounded by a hypersphere, however the Fremaverse shown in the image is quite lopsided. Many of the verses are fractals from this point due to the formation of clusters. A cluster of Grinaverses would be quite spaced out, but their gravitational attraction would lead them on orbits around each other. Sometimes, these collapse, but most structures require a larger object in the center for the other objects to spiral around. The same clustering effect would happen on a larger scale, like moons of planets of stars of galaxies... and so on. This Grina-Gas isn't a gas, it just behaves like it, just like how stars in galaxies look like some sort of massive cloud, but in fact it's just billions of stars too tiny to see. To be fair, there is, well, gas, and things smaller than stars, but that is too dim to see and doesn't emit its own light. Well, to be FAIR, the images aren't actually color and don't emit their own light either OK, let's not get too carried away, shall we?

The
Echaverse

th
verse corresponding to 10
84
is one of the many, many infinite spiral Archverses, wait NO it's actually finite! (gasp) These Fremaverses form naturally generating spirals of spirals, and spirals of spirals of you get the point... Now, these verses, instead of being bent by spacetime or some typical bs, are just physically smaller. This explains the giant variation in
Fremaverse
size. Bending doesn't really happen anymore due to the extremely large voids. But, on the small scales, the space is "coiled up" into giant cosmic balls.
Just like my bal-
NO!
>> Sorry, some idiot messed with our logs. We have knocked him out- I mean locked him out.
- EDA Research Team
This makes escaping them quite hard, but at this point we've escaped so many verses it's merely a small technological hurdle in the grand scheme of things; we just have to make another
VTC
.
Now, if it's finite, you might be asking, what could be at the center of this spiral?
Nothing. Yeah, not really any surprise. The light is just caused by the large concentration of matter.
The Echaverse, unlike the Fremaverse, lasts much longer (proportional to the regular lifespan increase of Archverses), as the spirals are held in place by gravity, and do not collide often. Therefore, the Echaverse doesn't die spectacularly, rather, as the Fremaverses slowly turn into black holes or explode in a puff of "Grina-Gas", the Echaverse eventually loses all this gas and it floats off, and they usually end up as a black hole, rouge Fremaverse or just... scattered Grina-Gas that may be picked up by neighbouring Echaverses, but that happening is not very likely.
! WARNING !
Do not try to add more
Fremaverses
to the Echaverse. Its
Drunaverse
will just destroy it, or worse, eject the whole Echaverse, or WORSE, be ejected from EXISTING by the surrounding
Drunaverses
. If you disrupt the Echaverse enough it might lose its shape, causing a whole host of problems, as the Echaverses are very close together in a

"Who the hail even made these goofy ahh verses?"
The Drunaverse, also appropriately named the Dottaverse, is the 29
th
Archverse
corresponding to the extended SI prefix for 10
87
. These Drunaverses are very uniform, and this is because these Drunaverses, like the Tredaverse, are sort of sentient. Their large size and packing density means that these Drunaverses must obey very strict rules or the may as well create a super-scale APOCALYPSE. We do not know why these Drunaverses prize order so much, but we do know that any Drunaverse that steps out of line will be "corrected", and by that I mean converted into a 19+28 dimensional supersized ultra-black hole.
! WARNING !
Don't play drums in the black areas of the Drunaverse. Drums are the Drunaverse's favourite food. It will absorb you, likely accelerating you to deadly speeds. In some cases, this may cause the Drunaverse to move so much it must be "corrected", or cause a Drunaverse war, which may result in catastrophe. In all cases, YOU DIE.
! WARNING 2 !
Also, don't tamper with the
Echaverses
close to the Drunaverse's center. They form the Drunaverse's consciousness and are key to its stability. They are very delicate and if you mess with them the Drunaverse may completely fall apart, causing many many problems for its neighbours, neighbours' neighbours, neighbours' neighbours' neighbours and even neighbours' neighbours' neighbours' neighbours and so on.
Rules
[
]
Drunaverses must have the same size (995328 ECH (this is 400000 in base 12)), to the closest amount possible. (They don't use light-years, so the number looks irregular to us, but they use
Echaverses
as measuring units (aka 10
812726
ly). If an
Echaverse
makes the Drunaverse too large, it is "ejected", lest the Drunaverse be ejected... from reality.
Drunaverses must have the same average density (with a room for error of about 8.3%) over an area of approximately 1728 ECH
19
(1728
echaverses
dekaenneracted, god that sounds so cursed with these stupid dimensions). Thus, they should also have the same mass and roughly the same amount of
Echaverses
.
Drunaverses must be 35831808 ECH apart at a minimum. These distances mean that the space between them is often littered with rogue
Echaverses
.

The Ciskaverse, also called a Triataverse or a Trakaverse, is the 30th divergent Archverse and is, spoiler alert, another Spiral verse. Alphasm sure likes his spirals... The Ciskaverse has many, many interesting features and properties which we'll be covering
! WARNING !
Don't touch the walls. It will absorb you and anything else. Ciskium absorbs anything. If you push
Drunaverses
into it, they will basically vanish.
? FUN FACT ?
Ciskaverses contain any types of archverses below it.
The Meta-Spiral
[
]
The Metaspiral is a portal to another realm, like the one in the
Peptaverse
. Except this time, it's not an inescapable portal to absolute darkness, but absolute brightness. This portal leads to Ciskian Heaven. The portal, however, is the opposite of the one in the
Peptaverse
. Once inside, you can freely leave anytime, but it takes an enormous amount of energy to open the portal for long enough for you to get in.
Ciskian "Heaven"
[
]
Ciskian Heaven is an interesting place. It's like a baby universe. The longer the portal to this place is opened for, the more time passes for it. If you keep the portal open, the baby universe's time will speed up exponentially at a rate of 1 second per second^^2, and this means it has more time to "inflate" like it did in the Big Bang. These universes are seperate though. If you close the portal then reopen it, the previous baby universe will be seperated from the others. Here's the interesting part. If you were inside the heaven while the portal was open, from your perspective the outside would get slower and slower and eventually grind to a halt. But, when the portal's closed, time speeds up exponentially, so if you could hypothetically see the outside it would start to go by faster and faster.
Now what does it even mean to say 1 second per second^^2???
Well, we can think about 1 second per second, normal flow of time. If it's 2 s/s, time is going 2x as fast (relative to something else). Now, 1 s/s/s, or 1 s/s
2
increases the s/s by 1 every second, aka time gets faster and faster every second. 1 s/s3 increases s/s
2
by 1 every second, 1 s/s
4
increases s/s
3
by 1 every second, etc. 1 second per second TETRATED to 2 (or ^^2) is increasing the EXPONENT by 1 per second, so it's not just exponentially, it's STACKED-exponentially.
So if you exited after only a few minutes, googols of years may have passed. It's quite simple to exit. You have to either reach the edge of the baby universe or fullfill the conditions to exit a
Universe
, at that point you will simply warp back out of the portal. I mean, about 93% of people haven't... actually... returned... yet. Uhhh but I'm sure they're FINE they're just waiting it out right???
Ciskium
[
]
Ciskium is the stuff that keeps the Ciskaverse together. It can crystallise space itself, it can literally solidify V O I D. The solid stuff is highly resistant to reality-based weapons and plain energy, and Ciskium itself is often used in weaponry as it can store INFINITE energy that can all be released in one hit, making it very useful for Bonaversians harvesting verses for PROFIT. It's also very useful in patching Paradoxes, Glitches and unstable areas. For these reasons, it's often considered a mix between the properties of
Sortaverse Matter
and
Quektonicite
. But, not a physical one, cause if you mix those two then you basically just got a weird bomb.
If you have very advanced tech, like that of a late
Bonaverse
coloniser, you can even make solidified space take the form of any material, except Ciskium and some other unusual substances. Interestingly, Ciskium makes amazing shields for energy based weapons as it just absorbs the energy. But it takes only one punch to detonate your entire enemy. It's for this reason Ciskium's so expensive and many wars have been fought over, and with, Ciskium.

! WARNING !
Bonaverses often contain very tiny
Yottaverses
. These Yottaverses are actually shrunk down. If you go in there, you will be an infinitesimal person going back to earth and you will get instantly annihilated by pretty much anything.
The Bonaverse is the 31
st
archverse, corresponding to the extended SI prefix for 10
93
. It is a fractal verse that rapidly expands and changes shape on scales of mere years. It has many structures and voids and thus, is an extremely hectic place.
Structures inside the Bonaverse
[
]
Center
[
]
At the very middle of the Main Spiral, matter gets packed so densely and strangely that
Ciskaverses
start to merge together, even with "fractal packing". In these conditions, life itself is effectively impossible, due to the intense warping and heat. In the very center, these
Ciskaverses
merge to create Bonacore, a material that is for all intents and purposes indestructible, fully control space, time and any other properties for any object. This means you can speed up anything, heal anyone by simply reverting them back to working order, and even generate extremely large amounts of Ciskium. Unfortunately, Bonacore is incredibly unstable, and the control and maintenance of Bonacore requires amounts of energy that even Ciskians can't even imagine.
Bonacore isn't a substance per se, but more like the physical hyperdimensional embodiment of the hellish conditions it is made in. It's extremely hard to extract, and many
Ciskaverses
and their civilisations have quite literally EXPLODED from being too close to, or trying to harvest, Bonacore. It's therefore no surprise that extracting this mineral requires extensive technologies that often require Kardashevs of 300 and above, which makes it incredibly rare and expensive.
The Main Spiral
[
]
The Main Spiral is actually discontinuous due to the large quantities of Subspirals. Practically all
Ciskaverses
reside on the Main Spiral or its many, many Subspirals. Very few Subspirals are dense/large enough to form Bonacore, as the real center is infinite, while all other Subspirals are finite. These Subspirals all have a central
Ciskaverse
, and depending on the size of the
Ciskaverse
, the Metaspiral can lead to other places in the Bonaverses, other Bonaverses, and potentially behave very, very differently to the regular Metaspiral. Some Meta-Spirals can be sufficiently large to sustain themselves and keep open, until the host
Ciskaverse
itself dies. When they reach the end of their lifespan and sufficient
Ciskaverses
die in the Center, the remaining
Ciskaverses
will congolmerate to form one, giant Meta-Spiral, and this Meta-Spiral opens to form an entirely new baby Bonaverse, and once this civilisation tries to expand past the Bonaverse, they'll be flung out into the deep, dark void of the
Audaverse
...
The Frame/Web
[
]
Most remaining
Ciskaverses
reside on the Web. The Frame is responsible for keeping the Bonaverse gravitationally intact. Its also one of the only continuous "pathways" to other sections of the Main Spiral. Other areas are incredibly unstable and will often glitch you into a Ciskian Heaven. Or worse, we don't know. Interestingly, while the blue areas are more stable and less likely to take you to some abyss, the yellow "hotspots" are strange, and sometimes will spew out random matter from possibly random verses. Once, a whole
Drunaverse
was spotted. But, due to its giant nature, it soon succumbed to the instability and bascially glitched out of existence. Due to your small size, it may be safe to make it across the VOID, but without using reality-bending crafts, it may be impractical to do so as reality-bending crafts often cause you to, well, vanish. Some higher level civilisations may also be able to accelerate an object to sufficient speeds such that no reality bending needs to be used to travel the voids in comparatively short amounts of time.
Exiting and Entering
[
]
How do I exit?
[
]
Exiting the Bonaverse requires you to traverse the Spiral, which will take an EXCRUCIATINGLY LONG TIME due to the need for steering though all the spirals and webs, and navigating the many
Ciskaverses
. Thus, it's often practicaly to use Subspiral Portal manipulation, an advanced technology that allows you to choose where the Subspiral Metaspirals, which works better for more "unstable" Subspirals, but of course is riskier that way. Usually you'll have to forcibly make it through an intermediate "baby universe", and to manipulate the spiral successfully you'll have to bend the laws of what's possible in the verse to make it where you want. Basically completely demolishing the fabric of reality. It's no surprise that escaping the Bonaverse was an incredibly hard feat.
How can I enter?
[
]
Entering is quite complicated. Nevermind you're probably somewhere in the middle of the
Audaversian
Void, but you can either take the excruciatingly long route, use the risky gain 2 gazillion m/s velocity route or you're gonna have to artificially create your own
Ciskaverse
conglomerate and manipulate it to take you to a random Bonaverse.
NOTE:
Do not ruin any of these archverses in this collections of archverses, or else I will teleport your father outside the Rimaverse.

"An archverse that's NOT a spiral??? Impossible!!!! Doesn't alphasm love spirals?"
The Audaverse is the penultimate verse before the
Googolverse
, corresponding to the extended SI prefix for 10
96
.
The Audaverse is a split verse, with one section being the one that we live in, and the other section being like a "mirror dimensions", one that we cannot see or interact with, but with advanced technology and ONLY by crossing this border at that small veil of light , we may see and interact with it. This dimension hasn't simply been found in higher-order dimensions, so it is truly a curious -verse. If you exit the verse, you will only ever be able to see or interact with the half in that verse, but you will also be able to interact with a small handful of other Audaverse halves. You can only "switch" by crossing such a boundary. Any matter that exits its Audaverse half will not be able to interact with other matter from other Audaverse halves. Thus, the Audaverse is quite useful, as it basically squares all the usable space in the
Ziraverse
. This space, does not actually exist on a higher dimension, but it can be treated as a higher dimension we'll never reach, and we just live on a slice of that.
The Audaverse Web
[
]
Going a bit smaller, the Audaverse also contains a small "web" of
Bonaverses
, like a large meta-
Bonaverse
. In this web, most of it is actually alot darker than it seems, and the Web is extremely thinly spread out, appearing as an incredibly faint glow that can barely be picked up by
Hyperphotons
. These
Bonaverses
are very very far apart, which is why using Metaspiral manipulation to exit
Bonaverses
is so risky. This is for a good reason. The bright spots in the main photo are often uninhabitable due to
Bonaverses
interfering with each other. This more often than not causes
Bonaverse
collisions, massive explosions that more often that not result in the opposite of living, which is death. In these conditions, sometimes Audiskium may be formed, a very strange light-emitting substance that is highly useful in Metaspiral manipulation, among other things which we will cover in the following section.
Audium
[
]
Audium can be thought of as a more extreme version of Bonacore. While it actually loses most of Bonacore's original properties, it has 2 unique properties:
It's extremely reliable at manipulating any kind of portal
It emits a    𝒮 𝒽 𝑒 𝑒 𝓉   ton of light
By "It emits a sheet ton of light", we mean "It emits so much goddamn light that the surrounding area literally has its space, time and reality completely rearranged. It is so fudgxing
b r i g h t
"
Yeah. No wonder living near Audium deposits is so hard. We believe that perhaps the Audaverse Switcher may use Audium to teleport anything to very distant locations and dimensions, but we can't be 100% sure.
Spiders
[
]
Spiders are non-sentient entities that we think may form similarly to
Drunaverses
. They are the reason for the small white lines in The Web. They spin something called a Meta-Web, which is almost entirely made up of Ciskium and mashed
Ciskaverses
, akin to the Main Spiral in the
Bonaverse
, but much more tangled. Like with
Drunaverses
, neither we nor the Spiders know why they do what they do, but these Metawebs are actually quite useful for easily extracting Ciskium, and sufficient "modification", even Bonacore, without having to enter a
Bonaverse
.
Escaping the Audaverse
[
]
The Audaverse has many obstacles in your way, such as mini-walls akin to the ones near the portal. This material was later discovered to be a stabilised form of Audium, and has since been mined to create giant walls. But, unless you have
Yuraversian
technology to mine/obliterate it, you'll need to get around it, as most of it is too
T H I C K
to just be warped through.
Destroying an Audaverse
[
]
Destroying an Audaverse is simple and if done right, can create massive amounts of Audium. Interestingly, if you destroy it the traditional way, it preserves the other "ghost" side. Destroying the Audaverse Switcher with its extremely strong Stabilised Audium is very, very hard, and will probably preserve the other side, but many Audaverses may be cut off from ever interacting with us, forever, so we don't actually know.
! WARNING !
Under no circumstances are you to attempt to destroy The Audaverse Switcher. #1 the Stabilised Audium may destabilise and kill you, and #2 you will end up with civilisations that will be forever alone because they have been cut off forever from us.
"But you didn't have to CUUUT me off, make it like it never happened and that we were nothin'... But I don't even NEED your technology, now you're just some civilisation that I used to know..."

"Today, we're going to be planting 1 QUINDECIMICRILLION Zira-trees for TeamTrees!"
-Mr. Beast
The Ziraverse is the 33
rd
and final Archverse before the
Googolverse
, corresponding to the extended SI prefix for 10
99
.
It takes the form of a "forest" of branching fractal trees, with holes and voids littering its whole surface of these "branches". There are many structures which we will be covering.
Structures inside the Ziraverse
[
]
The Ground
[
]
The "Ground" is host to many "Mini-Trees" and Holes, and hosts most of the
Audaverses
that exist in the Ziraverse. In fact, a good portion of these
Audaverses
actually exist "underground", which causes gravity to go downward. The Ziraverse itself is a sphere, and just like on Earth, the dense packing of
Audaverses
near the center means that the Ziraverse's center is incredibly hot. Mini-Trees are like Zira-Trees, except they are, well, just like Zira-Trees. In the space between Zira-Tree branches, Mini-Trees exist, and this trend continues until
Audaverses
are reached.
The Core
[
]
Inside the core of the Ziraverse, Audaverses become so crunched together that
Bonaverses
, as well as any other lower structure basically becomes 0% void, creating a whole array of problems, in addition to a whole array of
NEW MATERIALS!
Meet Zirium, a material that if used correctly can destroy and create entire Ziraverses. It's the foundation of verses and can manage energy and gigantic structures  to basically take any form. It can also control time and create new extra dimensions out of nothing. It's believed that this is the material that could have created all the hidden dimensions of
Audaverses
, and one amazing property is that it can be used for extremely intricate lower structures, forming fractals, or any other shape you desire. It's used in a worldprocessor, a near Ziraverse-size machine that uses super-high level computers to envision and create dimensions, verses, and laws for such verses. Some are even as big as
Yuraverses
and can create
Xemtaverses
!
Zira-Trees
[
]
Zira-Trees, like real trees, are alive but not sentient. They grow like fractals and host
Audaverses
within their structure. They also have many Holes and Voids inside them, and curiously, like to form branching "nodes" that connect to the ground, but most of them don't. These nodes are what mainly host the space where remaining
Audaverses
reside. They grow in a very strange manner, branching as fractals. But, if the
Audaverse
is basically borderless, what could these structures be made of? These seemingly solid structures are all made out of an amalgam of random matter from dying verses, solidified space, and energy from the
Googolversal
Source, which we will cover later.
Holes
[
]
The holes in the Zira-Trees and the Ground lead to an infinite void with an indestructible, unwarpable patterned floor composed of what we believe to be a lower-dimension Omniverse of sorts. This pattern starts out infinitesimally small at first, but as you venture further from the origin, the pattern gets bigger and bigger with seemingly no end. Time is nonexistent in the Zira-Void, and if you exit the ZiraVoid by simply falling into any hole, 0 time will have passed in the Ziraverse. There is also, strangely, no color in the Ziraverse, and seemingly inverted gravity, with gravity pulling you down stronger the farther up you try and go. Additionally, different holes in the Ziravoid lead to different holes in our Ziraverse, and eventually other Ziraverses. The chance of you going to a different place goes up the farther you are from the origin, and interestingly each Ziraversal Hole has its own, personal Ziravoid. After traversing incredibly long distances the places you travel to become weird, wonderful and sometimes inescapable. This is why using the ZV for transportation is most often a no-go, even if it can reduce distances drastically. NAH just kidding who cares if basically all the people who used it for long-distance transport went missing??? Despite the risk, it's often used for exploration and transport, yet it's most likely more favourable to use remotely controlled drones.
The Space
[
]
lmao what did you expect it's empty 😂😂😂
! WARNING !
If you spend too long in the Zira-Void, even though 0 time passes, strange anomalies will occur. Eventually, the entire Zira-Void begings to glitch in a shrinking border around you, trapping you. It's almost as if the Zira-Void is trying to tell you to get out, as if something bad will happen if you stay...
! WARNING #2 !
We attempted to resist, to stay in the Zira-Void and see what happens. 3 of my crew were lost to... them. I don't know if I could even refer to them as creatures. They were beings of a different kind...

prefix-chained -verse, corresponding to the number
Googol
, which is 10

. It has many-a-Minigoogolverse and
Ziraverse
. It takes the form of a large black hole called the "Source", which, instead of absorbing matter, expels high amounts of matter and energy seemingly infinitely. Destroying it requires post-
Xemtaversal
technology, but if destroyed, will not release infinite energy. This source means that
Ziraverses
can live for extremely long times, far longer than their
Yuraverse
or
Xemtaverse
.
Mini-Googolverse
[
]
The Googolverse can be compared to a very dense galaxy, filled with Mini-Googolverses, which are analogous to Solar Systems. These Solar Systems usually have a large gravitational body, a "star", and several
Ziraverses
orbiting it.
Stars
[
]
Stars in the Mini-Googolverse are different from
Ziraverses
. However, they do contain large quantities of mashed-up
Audaverses
, collected from The Source. They are mostly comprised of Audium and some Zirium, and as a result emits a ton of energy. These stars are incredibly useful for mining Zirium, Audium and collecting energy reliably, as any smaller and less crunched Archverses basically get blown away by the strong radiation. Sadly, in the extreme conditions of these stars, many, many would-be civilisations have probably been completely destroyed. OR maybe not, we don't know. for sure.
What's inside the Source?
[
]
The Source is an extremely dangerous place to be around. Macrillions of verses are being ejected every single second, so it becomes incredibly hard to well, live without being blown away. The repulsion force gets stronger and stronger as you approach the Source's horizon. Interestingly, it behaves like a black hole for all forms of photons or energy, but the forces that matter is ejected at is far greater than its "escape velocity". If you enter it, you'll basically get sucked in with no way out, like a black hole, but thankfully we have FTL drives. Inside, we see hundreds of images of verses being formed in extreme fast forward as they get ejected. The source matter appears as a rapidly epanding, infinite cloud of dust from the "singularity", from which all these verses are forming. These verses are then ejected and time ticks normally for them. So, time ticks extremely fast in the Source, and if one exits the Source, basically 0 time will have passed on the outside. This insane time dilation is the opposite of what we would expect inside a black hole, where gravity dilates time to move very fast on the outside, so that if you exited, infinite time would have passed on the outside.
Macro-Googolverses
[
]
There are things after the Googolverse. A Macro-Googolverse, which can be thought of as a galaxy group, corresponds to the 33.5
th
Archverse. There are multiple Googolverses, some close together and some spaced out. The Macro-Googolverses are also filled with copious amounts of smaller archverses and basically dust that wasn't absorbed by the Mini-Googolverses. This basically means that any civilisations that spawn here have almost 0 chance of making it out of their rogue Archverse. But, still better than dying a horrible death.
Uni-Googolverses
[
]
Uni-Googolverses are even bigger than Macro-Googolverses, and correspond to an entire Universe! They are pretty much the 33
2
/
3
th
Archverse and contain many Macro-Googolverses. They are rapidly expanding spheres of influence that have a border. These Uni-Googolverses are practically a one way barrier. They're very easy to enter, the border is practically nonexistent if you try and enter, but any attempts to break out or portal out will prove futile. Thankfully, they are actually relatively simple to use "warp out", and we have been doing that with plain old Universes ages ago.
These Uni-Googolverses sometimes do form conglomerations of Googolverses that might be considered a Multi-Googolverse, however this isn't common, so we will not be covering these in this section.

The
Yuraverse
is the 34
th
Archverse in the EDA series.
Structure
[
]
The
Yuraverse
is a infinite series of infinitely long tunnels, all converging to one point. It is possible to know from the inside how big is it, as each tunnel is angled slightly which should tell us that the Yuraverse is a 10
2
26
ly hypersphere will all tunnels ending at a point. But, no end or point can be reached by standard travel. The Yuraverse is non-Euclidean, and infinite. And no matter how far in or out you go, the calculations will suggest that you are on the very edge - 10
2
26
ly away from the supposed "singularity". Unlike the
Ochaverse
, there is no "reflector", it just keeps on going... Now, these tunnels are made of something called "Cosmobubbles", bubble-shaped cosmoses which we will cover now.
Cosmobubbles
[
]
Cosmobubbles can be thought of as small sub-Archverses, filled with string-like structures that keep the Cosmobubble together. Their borders are solid objects that
Hyperphotons
can pass through, but no other form of matter or energy. These Cosmobubbles contain many, many Uni-Googolverses, some Multi-Googolverses, and very rarely even Kilo-Googolverses, which are extremely dense in energy. Most of these verses reside on the Reality Strings, which prevent the Cosmobubble from contracting.
Due to the large dimensionality of the Yuraverse, these Cosmobubbles actually can intersect without interfering, allowing for large, and infinite amounts of Cosmobubbles to be packed in smaller spaces. Since there are infinite Cosmobubbles, travelling sufficient distances actually gives rise to weird new Archverses with potentially very different structures. As a result, these Cosmobubbles have been extremely useful in discovering new materials, such as:
Endrite:
It has many unique properties such as being able to control any kind of force, being able to reflect any kind of weapon, and even manipulating things that shouldn't be affected by force. It's found in verses very far out, with very different traits to ours, specifically the Endaverse. It also can manipulate time flow, space itself, and basically anything that can be considered a dimension.
Cosmium:
Cosmium is extremely useful for warping and travelling through barriers and unstable areas that were previously thought of as uncrossable. It can retrieve any item as well, and the shockwaves from exploding it can smash almost anything, sending it Yuraversal distances. It's named after the Cosmobubbles.
Metarium:
Metarium has the ability to create its own portals to really anywhere, so long as sufficient power is supplied, but some verses do have exceptions. It's a revolution for travel. This material is named after the Glitched Metaspirals inside
Bonaverses
.
Kamalite:
It is an extremely interesting material that can condense large spaces into tiny areas, exponentially smaller, and in the right conditions, the effect becomes even stronger It's named after the fact that it can fit a whole
Kamaverse
inside a single teaspoon
Kronull:
This material can convert between almost anything. Force, matter, you name it. What's notable is its ability to convert energy to time and vice versa. This means using Kronull and Endrite in conjunction can basically create infinite matter.
Realitystrings
[
]
Reality Strings are the strings keeping reality and the Cosmobubble from basically collapsing. On the Reality Strings reside most of the
Uni-Googolverses
and almost all of the
Multi-Googolverses
. Severing the Realitystrings increases the chance of unstable areas and glitches forming inside the Cosmobubble. If enough are severed the Cosmobubble itself collapses on itself
Mega-Googolverses and beyond
[
]
Mega-Googolverses and beyond can very rarely exist, but they are not counted by the EUSI as they are basically just clusters and way too rare to be counted.
So how
do
you escape?
[
]
Well, just like you do with the
Ochaverse
, you basically have to be going fast enough to break the Yuraverse itself. This requires you to be going about 10
2
26
ly/s - 10
2
27
ly/s (somewhere in that range). After that, you're basically traversing centimicrillions of Yuraverses every second, and you are ejected out.
Let's
blow it up!
[
]
Just like the
Jameaverse
, the infinite matter will create a rapidly expanding
Udekaverse
black hole that might possibly wipe out your civilisation's entire existence.
! WARNING !
It's best not to sever the Realitystrings. As you may know, bubbles on a soap layer "depend" on one another. Pop one and its ex-neighbours are more likely to pop. A report of this event said that the event might have accidentally destroyed 12 quintillion Cosmobubbles in an unstoppable chain reaction.

The Xemtaverse is the 35
th
Archverse corresponding to the prefix for 10
105
and possesses many traits similar to the
Tredaverse
. The Xemtaverse isn't sentient, but it does have similar areas.
The Core.
The Core is the Xemtaverse Mandelbrot itself. Unlike the
Tredaverse
, entering the Core takes you to a random place in the Xemtabyss. The Xemtabyss isn't anywhere special, just the area surrounding the Xemtaverse's field. However, due to its large mass, the Perimeter's space is so bent and squished that even getting to the Core actually takes considerably longer (on average) than getting to the Xemtabyss! The Core is also the source keeping all the
Yuraverses
together, and preserving reality for the most part. So, unlike the
Tredaverse
, the Field is actually one of the most stable areas ever. It's filled with significant amounts of
Sortaverse Matter
. When the Xemtaverse runs out of "power", the barrier decays and every
Yuraverse
begins to decay due to the extreme glitchy effects. However, it's not advisable to just wait it out until the border dies. We'd like to escape faster.
The Perimeter.
Located just outside the Core, the Perimeter hosts most of the
Yuraverses
in the Xemtaverse. Just like in the
Tredaverse
, space is able to be squished incredibly small here, allowing for incredibly dense packing of
Yuraverses
. It's extremely hard to move around, as almost all free-floating objects are "crystallised" in space by the extreme gravity concentrations. To escape the Perimeter, it's necessary to create a large glitched radius, which is hard due to the
Sortaverse Matter
. This may mean that you die in the process, and it especially requires high amounts of
Glitchonicite
or similar materials to move. This inevitably will displace many
Yuraverses
, but we must go on.
The Field.
By far the largest area, almost no
Yuraverses
exist here due to the "space crystallization", but it's still relatively stable. Relative to the outside, but relative to other verses, it's actually very unstable. This field acts as a space barrier to prevent the
Yuraverses
inside from basically ceasing to exist. and that's why the Border is so important.
The Xemtabyss:
The Xemtabyss is the small area surrounding the Field and it's HIGHLY unstable. It's actually quite small relative to the entire Xemtaverse, only 10 times the diameter, and when we're talking quadridecimicrillions of LY, it's puny! But, its effects are still harsh, and you may very well just cease to exist in the Xemtabyss without technology surpassing Kardashev 510.
The Border:
The Border is quite literally, unbreakable. No glitchiness, or force, or portal, or ANYTHING can cross this impenetrable barrier. It's practically an immovable object. And for good reason. Should this border break, all the matter will be exposed to the abyssal forces of the Outside, and the Xemtaverse will be unable to exist no more, glitching into nothing. It would be a catastrophe. Even
Hyperphotons
, famously able to cross any distance, quite literally cease to exist past the Border.
Escape?
[
]
When the Xemtaverse runs out of "power", the barrier decays and every
Yuraverse
begins to decay due to the extreme glitchy effects. However, it's not advisable to just wait it out until the border dies. We'd like to escape faster. So, we'll have to destroy the Border somehow. Like I said, the Border being destroyed would be an immeasurable catastrophe, actually it WAS an immeasurable catastrophe the first time we found out the hard way, but humans just want to escape. So how did they break this border? Well, it's an immovable object, and an unbreakable one too. But what can move it is the Xemtaverse itself. The Border is tied to the Core, as it is generated by the Core, so we can't move the Border, and we can't destroy the Core, so what if we
move
the Core?
By pushing the Core along like a tugboat, you traverse the abyss, and as you traverse it, if you don't have Xenophoton technology (even more OP than
Hyperphotons
), you'll eventually come across another Xemtaverse, by smashing into it.
Now, the Border is impassable, so they can't just phase through each other. But it's also an immovable object, as the Core generates it and the Border can't transfer force to the Core. So that only means that the Border
merges
. To avoid phasing through, or breaking, or changing velocity, the Borders basically move in unison. This allowed us to slurp up Xemtaverses into one Xemtaverse conglomerate. But what if we slingshotted one of them real fast? So fast the Borders couldn't merge. So fast that the Cores themselves collide?
See, this is what I mean by that "immeasurable catastrophe". Oh well, plenty o' Xemtaverses in the sea.
! WARNING !
Don't try to destroy stuff here. It has a 50/50 chance of you getting deleted or the entire Xemtaverse getting deleted.

The Wexaverse is a very unique Archverse. It's the 36
th
Archverse corresponding to the prefix for 10
108
. But of course, that is not what makes it special.
Metaborders
[
]
What makes the Wexaverse special is its
Metaborders,
large hypersphere bubbles akin to the one on the
Xemtaverse
. They really have no limit, and the farther you venture out of your own bubble, the more distant these worlds become from our own. So the
Xemtaverses
and below other than our own become very very weird and nothing like our own! Unlike in the
Ochaverse
, these Metaborders are fully sustaining Archverses, so no glitchiness, and it is finite. The borders serve to protect these Archverses from the verying laws of nature of some other Archverses, and some borders are like the one in the
Xemtaverse
, and some are so fragile they can be broken with a feather.
These Metaborders have tiers, like
Archverse, Archverse Cluster, Archverse Compound, Archverseplex, Archverseplock, Archverseplockplex...
Depending on the size of some collections, there are also things like
Giga-Archverse, Archverse Kilocluster, Archverse Megacompound, Archverse Wekaplex, Archverse Teraplock,
etc. As you can tell, these collections come in all shapes, sizes and magnitudes.
To prevent the Metaborders from colliding, the Plane holds all the Metaborders together. Depending on the "depth" of the Metaborder it may be stronger or weaker. At the Archverse, Archverse Cluster and Archverse Complex levels it's practically nonexistent, but at the very top level it's extremely strong. What every Archverse shares in common is that it has one central energy source. Higher level Metaborders are constructed by the collective energy of the Archverses it hosts. Our Archverse and neighbouring Archverse borders are extremely strong, but on the higher levels they're collectively very weak relative to the size of our host Metaborder. This made colonising our Wexaverse very easy.

You will need state of the art glitch protection to survive the other bubble if you plan on exploring that. The shells exist for a reason, you know. Even a

won't do; that's only intended for escaping the Wexaverse.

The Veptaverse is a high-energy chaotically expanding Archverse, full of many, many
Wexaverses
colliding with each other. It's the 37

The Veptaverse has "currents" per se, which push around
Wexaverses
, colliding them. Some
Wexaverses
are too weak for these, and sadly many
Wexaverses
just get destroyed in there, so ONLY THE STRONG SURVIVE. Inside the Veptaverse, the formula for time is
t
(
D
33
×
v
C
)
1
/
S
{\displaystyle {\frac{t}{(D^{33}\times v^C)^{1/S}}}}
, where t is seconds you have been there, D is the local density, v is the velocity, C is some Veptaversal constant, which is about 4.97, and S is some stability constant. It fluctuates, but generally it's proportional to the equation itself with some variance. The more unstable, the faster time can go.
With how dense
Wexaverses
are and how fast they go, it's no surprise that 1 second can easily become nanillions of years in the most unstable areas.
The currents also warp space and reality, meaning that the Veptaverse is Non-Euclidean, with plenty of holes, portals, empty spaces, ultra-dense areas and very inconsistent distances. Over a Veptaverse's lifespan, the currents will slow down, and so will its growth. After that, the Veptaverse will eventually dissipate and the
Wexaverses
run out of energy, causing all lower Archverses that aren't dead yet to succumb to the void effects.
Life Cycle
[
]
First off, where does the Veptaverse get its energy from? Well, in all
Wexaverses
, there is generally a natural repulsion force between all the Metaborders, which is one of the integral reasons why the Plane must exist inside each
Wexaverse
. When they hit each other, they are repelled, causing both to bounce back faster and faster. As
Wexaverse
clouds are compressed inside the fields of an
Uchaverse
, the
Wexaverses
are forced together, which kickstarts the self-sustaining Veptaversal expansion. Thus, the
Uchaverse
is an essential medium for the formation of Veptaverses, as Veptaverses die,
Xemtaverses
are rebuilt from the chaotic fields of the
Uchaverse
, and formed from the infinitely massive rogue
Yuraverses
. From there,
Wexaverses
are rebuilt and compressed to form Veptaverses. This whole process takes much, much longer than a Veptaverse lives for, so Veptaverses, on
Uchaversal
scales, are basically gone in a blink.
However, an interesting material is the "residue" left behind as
Wexaverses
decay. The conditions give rise to a host of materials, which is known as Uchaverse Matter. It's much more potent than Sortaverse matter, and also possesses the properties of
Ciskium
,
Audium
and
Source Particles
, emitting arguably weirder
Mingums
than the actual
Source Particles
. It's an extremely versatile substance and its accumulation in Veptaverses is what keeps the
Uchaverse
stable. Uchaverse Matter, also known as Wexium, is therefore extremely useful, extremely dense, and extremely expensive, worth almost 9 tredecillion Galactic currency for 1 teaspoon when it was initially discovered.
Honestly, the
"List of notable x-verses"
is just a sign the writer has zero ideas...
! WARNING !
The high current areas often change in current very rapidly. So more often than not the actual killer of the Veptaverse is not the currents or the stability, but how screwed up time gets when it speeds up and slows down and goes round and round.

The Uchaverse, 38
th
Archverse corresponding to the extended SI prefix for 10
114
, is a fractal "island" with curls, strands and nodes. It consists of clusters of
Veptaverses
,
represented by the black spots in the spirals. These Veptaverses are packed extremely compactly in these spots and so these spots are relatively stable.As you travel further from the black spots, into the blue and dark blue areas, the concept of position breaks down, so it is truly impossible to travel in these gap areas. However, the "raised" areas are habitable.
Uchavoid
[
]
There are 0 rogue
Veptaverses
inside the Uchaverse. Why? Well, it all has to do with the "gap areas" or the "ocean". These are unstable enough that sufficiently large bodies (like a large
Veptaverse
) may tear a permanent hole into the Uchavoid, which often expedites the Uchaverse's death.
! WARNING !
Doesn't matter how much abyssal protection you got, at some point in the Uchavoid, there are things OTHER than the void that will... take care of you. They're called the Obiese, swarms of entities that eat you alive.
Such a hole may be patched up by
Tritmaverse
matter, but we won't be covering
Tritmaverse
matter in this article.
Anyway, the Uchavoid is an infinite place of chaos. The farther "down" you go, the more chaotic it becomes. This is why the "raised" areas are more stable, because they are farther from the Uchavoid. From the depths of the Uchavoid, many-a-Archverses are spontaneously generated and many-a-Archverses are spontaneously
D E L E T E D
. By pure dumb luck, some matter may escape the Uchavoid, forming a new cycle of
Veptaverses
. While the Uchavoid's size is restricted to the
Tritmaverse
it resides in, we think its depth may be theoretically infinite, but practically there is a limit to how far you can go down into the chaos.
Thankfully, it's actually EASY to escape the Uchavoid, as the barrier is a one-way veil, so you can just phase through.
Uchaverse Technology
[
]
If you are quite advanced, you can use absorption tech to absorb spontaneously generated -verses from the Uchavoid, which serves as an amazing source of materials. It is extremely dangerous to manually destroy the Uchaverse. The Uchaverse will naturally die as the renewal of
Veptaverses
begins to slow down, but, destroying it brutally WILL CREATE A GATEWAY TO THE UCHAVOID. This gateway may be big enough so as to destroy many more Uchaverse strands, causing a chain reaction that could even disrupt the balance of a whole
Tritmaverse
.
Uchaverses may have strands, nodes, curls and even smaller versions of themselves. Usually a
Tritmaverse
has many, many Uchaverses side by side for stability, so usually destroying an Uchaverse won't have too many unintended consequences, but eiher way all the mateial will just fall into the Uchavoid. BUT, there have been many successful Uchaverse farms of higher level civilisations, and escpecially near the center of the
Tritmaverse
the Uchaverse may give unexpected and valuable rewards. Some
Tritmaverses
even have farms as big as MILLINILLIONS of Uchaverses! Which of course is still teeny weeny at this scale.

The Tritmaverse is a fractalverse consisting of many many chained
Uchaverses
arranged together, with multiple "globelets", 34-dimensional globes surrounded by a surface of
Uchaverses
. Inside the globelets, there is barely any matter but it is stable nevertheless. The areas surrounding them are covered by a substance that is useful and basically means that the Tritmaverse can last for a very very long time. What is this material? Why, it's...
Tritmaverse Matter
[
]
Tritmaverse Matter is a material that we think may accumulate from the chaos of the
Uchavoid
. Uchaverse Matter is much more potent than Sortaverse matter, and also possesses the properties of
Ciskium
,
Audium
and
Source Particles
, emitting arguably weirder
Mingums
than the actual
Source Particles
. But Tritmaverse Matter has very different properties. It acts like a magnet for light, absorbing almost all light, unlike its Uchaverse Component. It behaves like a liquid.
This Tritmaverse Matter is much more stable than Uchaverse Matter, and can generate
Uchaverse
strands infinitely, kind of like
Stem Matter
. Tritmaverse Matter has a strong connection to the
Uchavoid
(which permeates the entire Tritmaverse), yet is resistant to the
Uchavoid's
effects in and of itself. The areas surrounding the Tritmaverse Deposits are EXTREMELY unstable, and the veil between the
Uchavoid
and the Tritmaverse is practically nonexistent, yet its stability protects it! Tritmaverse Matter can rebuild gigantic structures just from the
Uchavoid
. There also exists
Destabilised Tritmaverse Matter.
Destabilised Tritmaverse Matter is much more unstable and instead of building structures, wreaks HAVOC! Using the Uchavoid, it uses the chaos to basically absorb
Uchaverses
, seriously dirupting the Tritmaverse and de-linking its parts.
Due to the existence of Tritmaverse Matter, it's damn near impossible to destroy a Tritmaverse. And why would you? But if you want to, if you
really
want to, then we do offer...
THE TRITMAVERSE DESTROYER!
[
]
The Tritmaverse Destroyer is a terrifying device. It consists of 3 simple steps. Sitmacite, Localised DTM (Destabilised Tritmaverse Matter), then finally utter destruction with either a Rima-Charge, copious quantities of
Glitchonicite
/similiar OR just... more DTM.
! WARNING !
The Tritmaverse Destroyer is very dangerous, and being in the presence of it kills you. In fact, it releases enough energy each second, to destroy half of an
Uchaverse
. After like 10 minutes it explodes on its own.
First, what is Sitmacite?
Sitmacite
[
]
Sitmacite has many properties. It stores, distributes and absorbs large quantities of energy, it's basically anti-corrupted and most importantly it is basically Anti-Tritmaverse Matter. It reacts with it and destroys it by corrupting a large area, deleting the Tritmaverse Matter. Deployment of Sitmacite will rid the Tritmaverse of all Tritmaverse Matter. Then, Destabilised Tritmaverse Matter is launched at the points where Tritmaverse Matter originally was, usually the intersections, which will destroy the Tritmaverse, tearing it to pieces. Finally, a Rima-Charge (an explosion so powerful that only a late-
Sitmaverse
civilisation could charge it) OR
Glitchonicite
/Sitmacite/other corrupting substance (which you'll need alot of but if mixed with DTM it's easy to make a giant Uchavoid hole to consume the entire Tritmaverse, or just plain DTM. The second option is common for a
Sitmaverse
civilisation, but with the Rima-Charge option you get to reap the PROFIT. However you could use the Uchavoid hole to make an EVEN BIGGER UCHAVOID FARM YEAAAAAAA

The Psychones
[
]
Pronounced "si-KO-nees", the Psychones are manifestations of the thoughts and imaginations of all the beings that live inside the Tritmaverse. The Psychones are sentient themselves, as they are collections of soul fragments of all the creatures that thunk a thought inside it, So they have a very mixed personality. If any entity dies, its soul shall live on inside these Psychones. Most Psychones are bright, and eject any "darker" thoughts, but some may turn evil and fully black. It's for this reason Sitmacite exists, to lock up these evils in the black areas you see in the picture, but we'll get to that.
The Psychones have a higher dimensionality than the Sitmaverse itself, meaning there are many, many more Psychones than should reasonably fit. Therefore, you may see then phasing in and out of our plane sometimes. Psychones are also incredibly wise. If you ask the right ones, you may get the true answers to questions no amount of
Kamaverses
could ever compute. They are incredibly interested in philosophy, arts, metaphysics, languages, psychology,

) and many more.
These Psychones are formed from the collective psyche of all the creatures in their locality. Staring at them for long enough (with sunglasses fellas) will display mirages of imaginary places, loved ones, things, and almost anything you think about on a daily basis. When enough thoughts or emotions are accumulated, or several Psychones merge together, the Psychone may become large enough to form a portal to the Psycheverse. Each Psycheverse is infinite, as is the imaginations of the creatures that all created it. The Psycheverse is a construct of all the souls that reside in it. It's a shared, yet timeless experience. No matter how long you spend in the Psycheverse, 0 time will pass on the outside, yet time in the Psycheverse starts at the origin of its creation. So, entering a Psycheverse 1 century after its creation will put you at 1 century in the Psycheverse. Therefore, the Psycheverse is a time machine as you can pass information back in time.
Inside the Psycheverse, you may feel feelings of bliss, euphoria, and peace. If the Psychones are "wise" enough, you may get answers to questions you never knew you needed answers to, and you will exit a better person than you were entering. The biggest Psychone is in the center, the Main Psychone. It's linked to all Psychones in the Sitmaverse.`It's the most wise, and can give REAL answers to for all intents and purposes ANY question. It really gives you true omniscience, and all people who have entered the Main Psycheverse say it was the best thing to ever happen to anyone, ever. You are cleansed of all ailments, all troubles, traumas, misfortunes, vices, bad thoughts and ignorance, and so on. The Main Psychone is not fully omnipotent, but strives to bring peace to anyone who asks for it. In fact, most "gods" in all cultures are just manifestations of the Psychones in their Sitmaverse.
The Psychones are indestructible, and so to host all the Psychones from all the new creatures created in the Sitmaverse, the Sitmaverse must grow over time. If the Sitmaverse is powerful enough, it can even use the radiant substances in the
Rimaverse
to convert any and all terrible thoughts in the Sitmaverse. Since the Psychones are indestructible, even if the entire
Rimaverse
is destroyed, the Psychones will use their combined power to form one giant Psychone, which will re-create the entire
Rimaverse
, draining its power before exploding into a light soul-gas so that the souls of all may live on inside this
Rimaverse
. The cycle of life is beautiful.
Structure of the Sitmaverse
[
]
The Sitmaverse contains many-a-
Tritmaverse
. These are all chained together as little "fibers" that form clusters, a bit like in the
Ianaverse
. These form Tritmal Clusters, Tritmal Superclusters, Tritmal Hyperclusters, Tritmal Ultraclusters, Tritmal Masterclusters, Tritmal Omegacluster-ok you get the gosh darn point. Anyway, the "bad Psychones" are trapped in Sitmacite deposits which kind of form Tritmal Frames. So it's structure is very similar to an
Ianaverse
, but it has a center, while the
Ianaverse
is centerless.
Materials in the Sitmaverse
[
]
The Sitmaverse contains 3 materials:
Sitmacite:
Sitmacite is a material that primarily can store, distribute and absorb large quantities of energy, and it's also anti-corrupted, and it's a vital component for the stability of the Sitmaverse. Its ability to absorb energy means it's extremely useful for locking away dark Psychones because they are beings of pure energy. It's also fairly useful for other purposes. It appears naturally due to the Psychones and the Psychones are willing to give out Sitmacite free of charge, because they do not believe in material possessions. Epic! The Sitmacite is also anti-corrupted. It sees
Tritmaverse
Matter as corrupted and thus corrupts it out of existence. So basically, it fights fire with fire, and that... somehow works!
Sitmatite:
Sitmatite is an incedibly strong material that lines the Sitmacite deposits. It's generated naturally by the Psychones and amplifies them. It's immune to the corruption, but the evil Psychones absolutely hate it, and Sitmatite is naturally repelled out of the Sitmacite deposits. This gives rise to very thick walls of Sitmatite that have been generated unwillingly by the imprisoned Evil Psychones. The Sitmatite helps amplify a Psychone's power and presence, and the more Sitmatite builds up, the more power the Psychones have to shape their Sitmaverse.
Sitmalite:
Sitmalite is a mineral of balance. It's essential for the stability of the Sitmaverse, but is as a result unstable in of itself and may decay into Sitmatite or Sitmacite. It's also created by Psychones. It's a good thing that there isn't too much Sitmalite, or the Sitmaverse would be a very boring place.
Are there evil Sitmaverses?
Yes, they can form, but often are immediately annihilated by the Grand Sitmaverse in the center of the
Rimaverse
.
! WARNING !
If you drill the Sitmatite, evil Psychones will flood the Sitmaverse, turning it into an evil one. The Grand Sitmaverse will destroy it for the sake of the
Rimaverse
, but everything in there will DIE.

"Bro, that wasn't a microdose." - God
The Rimaverse is the 41
st
Archverse. It's comprised of many, many
Sitmaverses
, with one Grand
Sitmaverse
in the center, which possesses power comparable to almost all the other
Sitmaverse
inside the Rimaverse combined. The Grand Sitmaverse has zero dark Sitmacite deposits. In fact we don't need them as the Rimaverse has the local power to completely convert any dark thoughts. It's basically one gigantic Psychone with amazing power. It's so powerful, entering and exiting will actually REVERSE time, and it possesses knowledge that can make omniscient for any question that could be asked at this stage and damn near omnipotent throughout the whole
Qoriaverse
.
The Rimaverse's truly unique properties, are its 8 hypercolored materials with very unique properties. These Rimacrystals can only really be controlled by the Grand Sitmaverse; they're so powerful. But, as long as you're doing this for the greater good they're chill with it.
! WARNING !
If you can do so, do not control the Rimacrystals without the Grand Sitmaverse's permission. It REALLY hates when they are controlled without its permission and you will be instantly vaporized by the Grand Sitmaverse once it notices the infraction.
Rimacrystals
[
]
Rimalite:
Rimalite
possesses the ability to generate any structure, kind of like
Zirium
, but much, much more powerful. It can create any material from nothing, and is only limited by how much you have. It can create and delete any of the other 6 Rimacrystals. In this way, it has full control over any matter, which is essential for the Rimaverse's stability. It can control any structure with sufficient
Rimalite
, from the quantum to the infinite. It can create itself infinitely, but at a limited rate.
Rimalite
can also be used to boost the effects of other Rimacrystals by adding more of them.
Lumarite:
Lumarite
can control, delete or create any energy, meaning it can also serve as an insane weapon for energy. This means it has the properties of SEVERAL materials which can be turned on and off. Some think that this can even destroy Psychones, but why would you even do that??? In a sense, this materials can harness and control any kind of energy.
Lumarite
can also be used to boost the effects of other Rimacrystals by increasing their intensity.
Kronomite:
Kronomite
can control any events, realities, and time. It has full control over all possibilities and timelines and can edit any event to be faster, or modified. It's extremely powerful, and requires no energy input.
Kronomite
can also be used to boost the effects of other Rimacrystals by speeding them up.
Sortaphyte:
Sortaphyte
has full control over any kind of stability or instability. It can fix up rifts and other phenomena, or completely destroy verses with its power. It's integral to sustaining the Rimaverse's stability and insane lifespan. It can also protect anything from any kind of harm, sort of like Metaborders in a
Wexaverse
.
Psychonite:
Psychonite
can control, enhance or purify the mind of anyone and anything, and is used by the Grand
Sitmaverse
. It can also be used to modify and control Psychofields, fields of influence created by Psychones. It can boost Psychones' power as well, and is highly powerful. By increasing the field of influence of Psychones,
Psychonite
can increase the Rimaverse's size and power, which can be boosted EVEN MORE by
Kronomite
!
Impacite:
Impacite
controls any and all forces. It's useful for external protection from disastrous phenomena, and can modify basically any conditions to make the Rimaverse more habitable and powerful physically. It's not very important, but still cool, and very, very useful for transportation through these insane distances.
Versatite:
Versatite
possesses the ability to control any realm or verse. It can reshape verses, similar to
Rimalite
, but it can also influence size, time, dimensions and any other conditions inside the verse. In this way it has the powers of all other Rimacrystals but only in a very specific use case. So, it's not really as
Versati
le as the name suggests. But it does have many properties and abilities. But still quite useful, and has many niche use cases
Unixite:
Unixite
can be used to boost the field of influence of any Rimacrystal beyond the Rimaverse, even. It can also control any Rimacrystal and add any modifications or added abilities to it, making Unixite rare and powerful.

I'd like to thank Tongfangnoi1 and 69fardhaha for basically making the following 3 verses.

Plamaverse
Contains:
Rimaverse
"The not-really-green dense webbing of
Rimaverses
which are actually white due to color blending. This is also where these massive spiders come from. Perhaps this is where the crazy spiders in Australia come from?"
The Qoriaverse is the 42nd archverse. It's a dense webbing filled with multiple
Rimaverses
, which unfortunately has their colors blend with eachother, making them white and straight up boring. It has 5 features that make this Archverse kind of unique from any other archverses, being that it's in the shape of a spider web, has actual spiders, and contains a special fluid that defies laws of physics. Additionally, it's littered with
Rimacrystal
deposits near the webbing, from Rimaversal Wars (More on that later). Every Rimaverse has different Rimaverses with many, many Rimacrystals, to the point where most Plamaversal civilizations use Qoriaverses to produce an insane amount of
Rimacrystals
. It can even repair destroyed spots by itself. If you see something new in the Qoriaverse, call "FEESH-57SYNFB-HD784FJ" for an investigation.
FACT: There's an actual debate on if the Qoriaverse is either a sponge or a web.
The Web
[
]
The web is where all
Rimaverses
stay, if a
Rimaverse
isn't in the web, they will be completely destroyed by Qorialiquid. The webbing is so dense that most of the
Rimaverses
are attached to eachother.  The Web also has a bunch of regions, which we still can't divide into. Each Qoriaverse has about 900 to 2,000 regions. With each region comes with a Qoriaspider. The webbing is very sticky, and allows the production of Qoriaspider Eggs, coming at a cost of a bunch of
Rimaverses
being destroyed.
Rimaverses
in The Web can't be destroyed by Qorialiquid thanks due to their property of being able to absorb the liquid. It can even evaporate the liquid completely, even if the liquid can't be evaporated.
Qoriaspiders
[
]
Qoriaspiders are the leaders of a region in the Qoriaverse. Qoriaspiders are fully sentient, and just like the bread, interested in humans. This is because humans make gourmet meals, which is what Qoriaspiders feed on for some reason. Sometimes, Qoriaspiders eat a random object, possibly even
REMOVING
them from existence. Qoriaspiders have multiple stages of life, being:
EGG:
When a Qoriaspider is born, a Mother Qoriaspider has to sacrifice a bunch of
Rimaverses
to be able to lay an egg on The Web. Qoriaspiders can't lay egs outside of The Web, as the eggs will be destroyed. The eggs are impossible to destroy if they are inside The Web. It's unknown how long it takes for one to hatch, but it's very likely that it takes multiple years. As the egg gets closer to hatching, the protective membrane gets more transparent, eventually revealing the hatchling.
HATCHLING:
After a long time, a Qoriaspider Egg will hatch into a baby Qoriaspider. These Qoriaspiders won't get regions, but they wil move into different Qoriaverses to search for regions that haven't been taken by other Qoriaspiders yet. They don't  have control over Rimaverses, and cannot move outside The Web or they will die. It's impossible to keep them as pets, as they are just as large as a bunch of
Rimaverses
. Not even a Plamaverse managed to keep a hatchling as a pet.
GROWN:
If a Qoriaspider ages enough, it will be strong enough to survive moving outside of The Web, and even resist a web being destroy. At this age, it can now lay Qoriaspider eggs, albeit a few. Qoriaspiders at this age often leave their birthplace to claim a region of a Qoriaverse. They speak the
┊▌⨨⑆ↀⴙ⻦ⵥ⊟◙
"language", which not even the feesh gods can understand. Their language contains approximately 10
10
10
322
letters, and 10
10
10
10
10
523
words.
ELDER:
After an insanely long amount of time, a Qoriaspider will start weakening, and will no longer be able to lay Qoriaspider Eggs. Their capability in the
┊▌⨨⑆ↀⴙ⻦ⵥ⊟◙
"language" is now much worse, and they can't even eat the random objects to delete them from reality. They're so old, that they can't even move between Qoriaverses. They now have to stay in The Web, or as you know, die. Qoriaspiders will weaken so much at this age that they will require support from Qoriaspiders of all ages.
DEAD:
It's  a Qoriaspider corpse, they will slowly fade away from reality, as The Web absorbs the corpse to power itself.
! WARNING !
Unless you REALLY know what you are doing, do not attempt to befriend a Qoriaspider. You either get absorbed by it or crushed by it. In both cases, you die.
? FUN FACT ?
A certain large group of
Rimaverses
, about 2x as large as our group and very far away, have tamed and formed a symbiotic relationship with the Qoriaspiders. They speak in a language we do not understand, but we call then the "Spider Riders" or the "Australian Alliance".
Qorialiquid
[
]
Qorialiquid is a liquid-state object that is so hot, that it can even destroy a Qoriaspider Egg and a Hatchling. It can be so hot, that it can LITERALLY DESTROY THE WALLS OF THE QORIAVERSE. Thankfully, the Qoriaverse uses recycled Qorialiquid to repair itself, so that it can stay alive longer. Regions are often destroyed due to Qorialiquid getting too hot. The reason why Qoriaverse regions nowadays don't get destroyed due to the liquid because they evolved to not be destroyed by the insane heat. It's so green, that even the entire Qoriaverse became green. It defies all laws of physics, like being 37 trigintillion degrees celsius, being able to COMPLETELY defy gravity, and even clone itself.
If a Qoriaverse detects that a part of itself has been ripped from the fabric of reality, it will immediately use recycled Qorialiquid to repair the part. Most of the time, it's a sucess, but at extremely rare cases, the entire Qoriaverse gets destroyed, because the recycled Qorialiquid was too much, or the Qoriaverse repaired that part too many times.
Qoriaversal Wars
[
]
Inside the Qoriaverse,
Rimaverses
can grow and conquer the surface of the Web, practically infinitely. Of course, in practice, NOT infinitely, growing to like 0.0000000... 1 million ....0000000001% of the Qoriaverse is impossible. This is due to the fact we're dealing with DOUBLE EXPONENTS, so 10
2
33
is practically 0 compared to 10
2
34
. But, even growing 2x is quite hard, because the other
Rimaverses
, let's just say they won't be happy with that.
The
Rimaverses
are gigantic sentient verses, and so, they're incredibly intelligent and incredibly diverse. Even neighbouring
Rimaverses
are so varied in their laws of existence that one cannot enter another's territory without either deleting parts of themself, or deleting parts of the other. For this reason,
Rimaverse
battles are bitter, chaotic, and necessary, for a small
Rimaverse
is a dead
Rimaverse
, and due for, let's just say, "harvesting". Thus,
Rimaverses
, to succeed, must form alliances with each other. As
Rimaverses
spend more time with each other in an alliance, their traits and personality become more similar and they can coexist better (this also happens with humans!
WOW
). The more
Rimaverses
in an alliance, the greater chance of survival, with more traits to share, use and specialise. With how big the Qoriaverse is, alliances, usually only have 10-1000000
Rimaverses
. But the biggest, the Rimaversal Empire, contains over 10
2
32.5
Rimaverses
! WOW! That number might not mean much to you, but that means it's nearly as big as the entire Qoriaverse! Well actually NO, because, again, we're dealing with power towers, so it's about
1
/
30 billion
times the size of a Qoriaverse.
But either way, there are many weird alliances. Ours is actually quite strong, at 29,365
Rimaverses
all coexisting, all to create one giant
Rimaverse
base. It's at war with some of our more bitter neighbours, but right now neither of our weapons can enter the other without causing a huge explosion that doesn't leave anyone better off. There are very few
Sitmaverses
near the frontlines though, so... good for US!

and destabilize the entire omniverse! Nothing would go wrong!"
Alphasm
, [REDACTED]
The Plamaverse is the 43
rd
archverse, and the fact that it is full of plasma is pure coincidence. It's unique from the other Archverses, as 98% of the Archverse is made entirely from all kinds of plasma. It contains many, many plasma structures, and only very few
Qoriaverses
, which must be shielded by and incredibly dense web to not disintegrate. In fact,
Qorialiquid
is an amalgamation of random plasmas in the Plamaverse, cooled, stabilised and baked to still-100%-uninhabitable-perfection.
You wanna know what's crazy? Even though the added 59 dimensions are NOT spatial dimensions and can't really be traversed. they're SOMEHOW FILLED WITH
MORE PLASMA.
THAT'S NOT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE. THE PAST, THE FUTURE, THE FUDGXING 11 DIMENSIONAL CALIBI YAU MANIFOLD IT'S ALL PLASMA!!! TIME IS PLASMA! AAAAAA
What was I talking about?
Structures of the Plamaverse
[
]
The Plamaverse has many plasmic structures, all made of and filled with plasma. Of course.
Fields:
The Fields appear as rapidly shifting clouds. These keep the Plasma in the Plamaverse moving and mixing to ensure plasma distribution. They are also fields of the Plamaverse's influence to keep it protected from the arguably more inhospitable
Olmaverse
. The Fields generate the Border, which doesn't really deserve it's own section bro it's a BORDER.
Plasma Orbs & Boxes:
Plasma Orbs are the floaty things, and they create Plasma. These carry various plasmas and they are basically self-sustaining chains that create more plasma, making them bigger and bigger, until they are struck by a bolt. Then, they'll release the plasma with a massive BANG. Boxes, have no plasma JUST KIDDING. THEY'RE FILLED WITH MORE PLASMA!!!! These boxes are incredibly strong, and their insides are less chaotic. Some
Qoriaverses
reside in Boxes, as the plasma is more stable. But if a box is destroyed, it collapses into a temporary Plasma Hole, turning anything in and near it into pure energy, destroying itself.
The Big Orb:
The Big Orb takes in plasma as fuel (there's plenty around) and uses it to sustain the Fields, the Lightning Bolts, which strengthen the Border, and to create random stuff, most of which immediately DIES in the plasma. It also stores energy. The more energy stored, the more PPPOOOOWWWEEERR the Plamaverse has. Sufficiently large Plamaverses might even move around and gobble smaller ones for PPPOOOOWWWEEERR!!!111!!1!!!!1f
! WARNING !
Again, do not destroy things here.
Notable Types of Plasma
[
]
There's practically infinite kinds of plasma with many properties. But, here are 10 we picked out randomly we think are very interesting.
PLASMA-(ḓӥᢜ�ⷐ...  [1000] ....⚰⯬ᵭ⁅ᔦṪ)
Also dubbed INFIPLASMA, this converts pure energy + 1 unit of any plasma into 3 units of any other plasma. It's the source of all energy.
PLASMA-(ᱠް≷ᙬ☧ଣ൲... [1000] ...ⲥ፰ၺᎼᛒ)
Also dubbed Enerplasma, this passively creates energy, by harvesting from the outside of the Plamaverse.
PLASMA-(ⴥГ٪◨₾ᄔ... [1000] ...સ¢ᇔꎤ탼)
Also dubbed Riminfaplasma, this can control anything, having the properties of all
Rimacrystals
AND THEN SOME.
PLASMA-(ᵙ≋⬝ɱ∪៯... [1000] ...ꄀⴷ┲⸠ᨕ)
Also known as Existiplasma. This plasma can conjure up anything that should be 100% impossible, and modify reality itself to make it possible. For example, Existiplasma can conjure up a Universe where your father actually comes back with the milk. But some are so wild they can never ever happen in any case; these events are too hard for even Existiplasma. For example: you getting any B
⬤⬤⬤
hes.
PLASMA-(ᘬ⯇vⱯᦃ்... [1000] ...ẵማ܍٤ı፴)
It can invent any kind of plasma. It can invent anything. It's basically infinity IQ plasma.
PLASMA-(ᝡ೦ᛦ౿Ꮅ... [1000] ...ᕫ᜽ᵜ뺙⃞ᤦ)
Also known as Sitasma, it can basically make Psychones that are super-powerful, and immensely omnipotent.
PLASMA-(ባ‗බಛᬨ... [1000] ...ᨌ₾ᦧ⹳ኺ)
Also known as Kronosama, it makes anything last almost eternally
PLASMA-(ᎆ⯢ரӎռ... [1000] ...ⴘື⚕ӭ녱)
Also known as NO MORE MATERIALS, it's basically a genie that can grant any wish so you don't need all these materials.
PLASMA-(Ⴔᤑ⟣஽ఓ... [1000] ...ᡠᐤ↹ታ⭵)
Also known as Telesma, it can teleport you anywhere so long as you know where that is.
The Machine
[
]
The Machine is effectively a way better
Kamaverse
. It's gigantic and made of a very specific array of Plamaplasma. It uses reality and all 100 dimensions to calculate and store information. It is the wisdom, processing power and general knowledge of a whole Plamaverse 100% filled with as many
Sitmaverses
or
Kamaverses
as could fit. It can resolve any unsolvable question. It's very very smart. It resides inside the Big Orb.

The Olmaverse is a special Archverse, in that every one is very different, and also having many, many rerolling events, due to the Olmaversal Twists, which we will cover later. At this point, verse size, or more better put the amount of zeroes is roughly tripling, so now the 10
2
num
will increase by around 1.58.
Olmaversal Randomness
[
]
An Olmaverse is constantly changing. Every 10-1000 years (roughly), the Olmaverse will do a 100% reroll, but the magnitude of this reroll varies from re-organisation to complete overhaul of the laws of nature in the Olmaverse. Smaller events happen more frequently near the Olmaversal Twists, which are pictured, but some are so massive and high-energy that they cause a cascade of giant magnitude.
The rerolls are caused by "rotational buildups" in the Twists, which are powered by
Plamaverses
getting their plasma "recycled" and their
Qoriaverses
spilling out to be reabsorbed. The Olmaverse is full of Olmaplasma, which contains rogue
Qoriaverses
, spilled
Plamaverse
plasma, and some other sussiness idk. All
Plamaverses
are slowly accelerated to the center (actually at breakneck speeds, but slow compared to an Olmaverse)
! WARNING !
Attempting to make an Olmaverse reroll into what it was trying to reroll from will cause a destabilization event and you already know what will happen if the Olmaverse is destabilized.
Olmaversal Twisters
[
]
The Olmaversal Twists are giant high-dimensional imaginary vortexes getting their energy beamed from the center, which is very hot, inhospitable and dense. They are always spinning, and they use the spinning energy along with whatever matter they can absorb to "bake" a new fresh batch of
Plamaverses
. The Twisters always make
Plamaverses
slightly different, so the Olmaverse passively becomes more different.
Also, during what is assumed to be a random amount of time between 1 second and several centuries the Twisters may "snap", spinning so fast they drastically alter the nature of the local area, from a rearranging of
Plamaverses
to a rearranging of reality. Sufficient magnitude events may cascade through the WHOLE OLMAVERSE, which can cause an array of problems for hopeful colonisers.
Plamaverses
and their make and model, remain curiously the same.
Olmaversal Creation
[
]
Olmaverses are created by
Nasiaverses
, as a kind of battery. They are made to be self sustaining verses for a long time. As
Plamaverses
start having the verses inside them die, they get recycled and baked into fresh
Plamaverses
. The instability seems to be unpatched, but civilisations have done it. It seems whatever, or whoever launched the
Nhasiaverses
didn't have enough time to patch this bug. But, when the Olmaverses die, they self-destruct and release all the energy to fuel the
Nhasiaverse
for a long time. There are many many such Olmaverses, and the
Nhasiaverse
. can last for basically a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long time, even without the ability to harvest minerals from the cosmos.

The Nhasiaverse takes the form of a gigantic engine, moving through empty cosmos. It has a transparent sphere in the center, which protects all the
Olmaverses
in the center from being destroyed. This photo is not a real photo, but an illustration from observations, as anything that tries to exit will just fly away. The Engine appears to be running with an engine the likes of which have never ever been seen before, and we think the Nhasiaverse was set out by an incredibly, incredibly old civilisation that mysteriously died out. We have never been able to find any relics of this aformentioned civilisation, apart from the Nhasiaverse itself and its architecture. The Nhasiaverse appears to be made of pure bronze, which should normally be obliterated in the Nhasiaverse's conditions but curiously remains intact. The Nhasiaverse is so lonely even our best
Hyperphoton
cameras cannot detect anything out there.
The Nhasiaverse is surrounded by a disc, which we think serves as some sort of energy collector yet we have no idea how it works. It is surrounded by 3 hollow rotating discs, which contain cosmological inscriptions, carvings and protective sigils the likes of which we have never seen before and from close inspection and intense translation reveal the civilisation's, which we'll call the Nhasiaversians, history.

Nasiaverse
[
]
That ended on a sad note. Either way, to wrap up this article the Nasiaverse is a verse that contains all the
Olmaverses
using a compact spiral system. It contains many many
Olmaverses
and the center is responsible for sustaining all the
Olmaverses
and harvesting them when they die or run out of power. It can last for a long, long time, as
Olmaverses
have a very low chance of dying and the Nhasiaverse uses a super advanced collection system.
A few thousand years into the journey, one of the "sigils" appeared to fall off, causing subtle chaos within the Nasiaverses. The Nasiaverses started to collapse, and it seemed gravity was threatening to destroy the Nasiaverse. This had to be fixed very quickly, so we researched a new anti-gravitational system onboard, to fix the Nasiaverses.
At the current pace, however, this disaster would likely happen before the so called "destination" was reached, which was estimated to be over 10

ly away, so it was imperative that we did something to make the Nhasiaverse go faster. To do this, we modified the Nasiaverses making it akin to the ones in the Motaverse, removing the safeties, making it a little less safe, but allowed us to drastically cut down on our time.

Nasiaverses
"The embodiment of Motion as an archverse. Everything here has some kind of motion."
Motaverses are, as it's name would suggest, motion-dependent. Every single component, no matter how small, is rotating. There are a high amount of Motavoids which are very large and are what our
Nhasiaverses
were going through. It's quite unlikely that we actually existed inside a
Nhasiaverse
, as it would be much more likely we'd just be in some variation of a
Nasiaverses
. I guess the Nhasiaversians died out before colonising the whole Motaverse.
Loco-Mota
[
]
Every single component in the Motaverse has it's own Loco-Mota, which is seen as the blue dots in the image. There's multiple components to make the Loco-Mota function. The Loco-Mota is powered by large amounts on infinitely generating
Nasiaverses
. While the
Nasiaverses
on the
Nhasiaverses
were modified for long lasting function in exchange for slow speed, the
Nasiaverses
may die faster, but they output huge power because of their highly, highly unstable
Olmaverse
power system, which harnesses instability in the
Olmaverses
to power the Loco-Mota. So, how do these Nasiaverses work then?
First of all, the Nasiaverse is incredibly densely packed with huge
Olmaverses
, using highly unstable methods to cram lots and lots or
Olmaverses
together which has a high chance of basically destroying itself. The Orbic Capsules are in the center of all
Olmaverses
. They use multiple mineral types to constantly speed up and destabilise the
Olmaverses
, maximising energy throughput. This makes the
Olmaverses
swell and sometimes explode, and at that point, the
Olmaverses
are destroyed and their
Plamaverses
are harvested, while the
Qoriaverses
are re-used. From then on the
Nasiaverses
beam their energy to the Pillars for energy storage. But this means
Nasiaverses
in the Loco-Mota are more vulnerable to destruction, which isn't normally a problem in the Motaverse, as
Nasiaverses
can be re-generated but is a huge problem in the
Nhasiaverses
as it could run out of power permanently.
The Pillars store energy like a battery and are also the fundamental motor for the Motaverse. They are much, much more efficient than a
Nhasiaverse
and much bigger, and all components are made of a strange blue substance that is very heavy and nearly indestructible. The Motaverse Moving is not only essential for the Motaverse's safety, but also energy; the Motaverse's motion is the eternal engine that keeps everything in it running.
Motaverse Speed Chart
[
]
Motaverses move and rotate at different speeds. If a Motaverse moves too slow or too fast, it may die a very violent or sad death. A Motaverse that spends too much time in one place might overheat or get destroyed by the
Luxaverse
, while one that moves too fast might get shredded, even with a huge rotational protection. A Motaverse that rotates too slow dies from lack of power, while a Motaverse that is too fast may rip itself apart.
! WARNING !
Do not tamper with a Motaverse's speed if you have the tech to do so. It will very likely destroy what you were trying to use to do so, making it a waste of resources.

How aren't we affected by the speed?
[
]
The Loco-Motas are wayy to big for us to be affected. Additionally, the
Nasiaverses
are under Accelelock, which mitigates acceleration inside the
Nasiaverses
. And there's barely any acceleration, as the Motaverse mainly moves at a constant velocity.

The Luxverse is the 47
th
archverse, and is the 36th in the EDA chain. The Luxaverses are quite radiant Archverses that defy conventional understanding. They're places where light does more than just illuminating, but it also does more complex things. It can live, breathe, and even think. There's almost no black holes in these archverses, and the shiniest parts of them can actually be dangerously bright.
In the Luxaverses, stars are sentient beings, each with their unique personalities. They communicate through pulses of light.
Planets in the Luxaverses (that are artificial) are made of crystalline structures that refract extrenal lights to cause even more brightness. All these methods are artificially made since a Luxaverse can implode if the light dissapears in big amounts. Light strings all these archverses to not fall over.
Luxaverses tend to absorb smaller ones or rests from exploded Motaverses to boost themselves. For them, its almost like a game of survival. The brightest ones survive, the darkest ones get deleted. Some Luxaverses end up releasing small parts of themselves so Luxaverses dont get extinct along with all the things they contain.
Luxaversian Lightscape
[
]
The Lightscape is where almost all of the light is. It's so bright, that it's even brighter  than the brightest Olmaverse. It contains billions of forms of light, and most of these defy every single law of physics. Light beams are everywhere in the Lightscape, and can blind you even before you enter it. The immense heat of the Lightscape can completely destroy an Olmaverse. due to lights. Most of the lights come out of here, and never go back in ever again.
Open Areas
[
]
Open Areas exists so that Moteverses can move around without their civilizations being destroyed by their motion. They still have light, but never enough to blind you. They are very open, and are always located behind the Lightscape Portal. Open Areas aren't really interesting, but what's interesting is
Luxorinite
[
]
Luxorinite is a rare and extraordinary gem that possesses the unique ability to emit an intense and mesmerizing light. Luxorinite is found everywhere inside the Luxaverse, being the reason it's so bright. It's so easy to find, that most Kentaversian Civilizations already use it as a source of lightning for their buildings. So, why haven't we started using yet?
Well, Luxorinite is so hot, that it can actually kill an entire Motaverse. It has to be cooled to Liquid Nitrogen temperature first, before being used as a source of lightning. If not, expect for a Motaverse to be gone in milliseconds. Even some Motaversian Civilizations have made a Luxorinite Cooler just to use 1 atom of it. Only 2 Motaversian Civilizations and 133 Luxarian Civilizations have managed to just use a single atom of Luxorinite.
So you want to be safe from the light?
[
]
Well, being in a spot inside the Luxaverse without light is nearly impossible due to Luxorinite, but we recommened staying close to the Moteverses that move around. These often get no light, and are actually habitable, just find a spot free of Plamaverses. there are 3 regions, with one barely having a lightless zone, but you can stay alive there.
How Hot Is It, Really?
PeeWoop987986985984173 Comes In Again! And Calculated That The Temperature Of A Single Atom-Sized Piece Of Luxorinite Is Roughly 10^2^32.87 Degrees Celcius! That's Very Hot!

The Kentaverse is the 48
th
Archverse in the EDA series, and unlike the
Luxaverse
, is surprisingly dark. This is because the
Luxaverses
are very sparse, and sometimes concentrated at one area, which is illuminated in a blue light. The Kentaverse has Crimsonite, a dark crimson substance that makes everything dark. There are many, many black holes and pitfalls, which can serve as transportation, beaming anything to a random black hole nearby. Blue is the worst enemy of Crimsonite, but any other light is absorbed by the Crimsonite. Thus, rogue
Luxaverses
seldom exist as they need to stay together to survive the harsh Kentaverse.
Luxians
[
]
The
Luxaverses
form complexes of light called Luxians. Some Luxians can survive the darkness of the Kentaverse. The Kentaverse is very dark, but they use Invi-Light to see, which cannot be absorbed or detected by the Kentaverse. Invi-Light behaves like a
Hyperphoton
but it doesn't emit any photons in and of itself so it's invisible.
Crimsonite, in some areas, is so dense that it can solidify the darkness itself. This Darkness is quite durable, and used by Luxians to shield themselves from the Kentaverse.
In this regard, the Kentaverse is a pretty generic verse. There really is not much going on in a Kentaverse. The Luxians have some pretty cool tech. One of them, is a chunk of Crimsonite exposed to harsh
Luxaverse
light. This hardens the Crimsonite to form Crimstone, an incredibly hard material that can actually NEGATE Crimsonite. Escaping the Kentaverse for us is relatively easy, but neither we nor the Luxians possess teh technology to take them out of the Kentaverse.
The Seams
[
]
One interesting thing about the Kentaverse is in the seams where it looks like the image flips. In these seams, everything is compressed and when infinity is reached, it teleports to another seam in the Kentaverse and starts expanding. You can think about it as if the matter can't contract anymore, so the ends pass through each other.
! WARNING !
Do not go anywhere close to the seams! They go very, very fast and may pull you in, crush you to death, tear you apart, push you so fast you DIE, or all of the above.
In the core, all seams meet at an origin, circling around. The core is kind of like a point seam which will simultaneously blow you apart and compress you to death, and also like a superspinning SPINgularity where reality dies.

Jataverse and Cyanite
[
]
The Jataverse is the 49
th
Archverse in the EDA series. Jataverses are quite bizarre Archverses. A Jataverse is very balanced, and its only goal is to make everything balanced. Null matter forms the structure of the Jataverse. It's indestructible, has no charge, no properties, and is a perfect middleground between any extreme possible. While the Jataverse is balanced, it's not necessarily uniform. All that matters is that for every material, there is an equal and opposite amount of the inverse. There are many
Kentaverses
in the Jataverse and that means that somewhere there must be an Anti-Kentaverse, made of Cyanite and antimatter. In the center, though, there is an Equilibrium Engine. It's made of 100% antimatter and feeds off all materials in the Jataverse to create true equilibrium. It can really do anything to the Jataverse, and if hacked, it could cause the whole Jataverse to enter disarray.
Un-Balancing and Yellorium
[
]
However, if the Jataverse made everything balanced, everything would be extremely boring. That's what Yellorium is form. Unlike the blue segments of the image you see, Yelloriu is present everywhere to oppose the balancing. Yellorium is made from reprocessed Luxaversal Matter, and creates a lot of energy. While Cyanite accelerated entropy and gains energy, Yellorium uses energy to attempt reversing entropy. Therefore, the Yellorium attempts to convert the Cyanite deposits into energy. If Cyanite wins, Yellorium could easily go extinct, and if Yellorium wins, Cyanite would go extinct and the whole Jataverse would subsequently be eaten, so that's why the Equilibrium Engine does not create equilibrium (maximum entropy), but instead
true
equilibrium, a balance between pure Cyanite, pure Yellorium or none at all. Because if too much of both materials existed the Jataverse itself would stop existing. This is why the Equilibrium Engine uses Magentite, a THIRD matter type, which is mined by the Magentigators.
Magentigators and Magentite
[
]
Magentite is a material that facilitates the conversion of Cyanite, Yellorium and regular matter. If there is too much of one material in an area, it will delete it and convert it into the least common matter in that area. If there is not enough of one matter, it will merge two matters into the other kind of matter. Over time, the kinds of matter have divided into groups where they thrive. In these deposits, Magentite has collected into large creatures called Magentigators, which you can see in the image as long fuzzy things on the Swirl Dimples. They feed off extreme concentrations of one kind of matter and output other kinds of matter, helping the Jataverse maintain a True Equilibrium.
Swirl Dimples
[
]
The Jataverse requires energy. Therefore, the Jataverse is covered in Swirl Dimples, which you can probably identify as the rings with swirly "mountains" in the middle. These provide the energy for the Jataverse, and also host lots of Yellorium/Cyanite "camps", and thus Magentigators. How do the Swirl Dimples generate energy? Well, they extract energy from the
Inaverse
, which we will cover now.

"I'm in a verse!" -Inaverse Ina-habitant
The Inaverse is an extremely energetic verse. It's the 50
th
archverse. Its spheres and rings act as energy distributors, radiating Radiant Particles, which are electrons that are regrettably invisible. These make the Inaverse have a sort of magnetic field called the Ina-Field, which is generated by the Radiant Particles.
Structure of the Inaverse
[
]
The Core of the Inaverse is the large ball you see here. It acts as a reservoir for the Inaverse's energy, slowly depleting. The spokes on the surface of the Inaverse Core beam packets of Hyperradiant Particles towards the rings and distributors. The rings and distributors then beam Radiant Particles around their surface, where the
Jataverses
live.
Now if you look closely, you'll find that the Inaverse is actually brown, and this is the surface
Jataverses
. These
Jataverses
tend to be extremely energised to the close proximity to the spokes, as they leach energy off the spokes. Due to their large energy consumption, they are overrun with energy-sucking Yellorium, and all other matter is almost nonexistent. This creates massive
Jataverses
that are completely disordered and spread wherever they like. Therefore, the Inaverse naturally creates Cyanite as a byproduct of the beaming process. This works to kill off the surface
Jataverses
, but so far the efforts have been futile. The rest is mostly blue spokes, which work to recieve and beam Hyperradiant Particles.
The Inaverse has an inside, and the inside is much more interesting. The inside is where most
Jataverses
live. The Inaverses provide Radiant Particles for the
Jataverses
to function, and the
Jataverses
keep the Inaverse stable enough to continue existing. The Jataverses preserve the stability of matter in the Inaverse. However, there are many risks. The
Jataverse
, if it does not get power, will be overrun with too much Cyanite. This Cyanite will not only destroy all life in the
Jataverse
but kill the Inaverse by turning it into mush. If it gets too much, the
Jataverses
may be overrun with Yellorium instead. In most cases these kinds of Inaverse die, but some rare cases somehow survive, which we will cover in the "Rare Kinds of Inaverse" section.
Now to the center. The Reservoir contains a fluid called Refined Radiance. This Refined Radiance is energised to beam it as Radiant Particles. Refined Radiance is sadly non-renewable, at least not technically. The
Homaverse
periodically beams a super-high intensity beam with a power equivalent to tetrecillions of Ina-Units, which the Reservoir uses to create Refined Radiance using the Inaversal Prism and Cyanite, which is transported back to the core via the rings.

Rare Kinds of Inaverse
[
]
There are many rare kinds of Inaverse.
Supercharged Inaverse:
The Supercharged Inaverse is a Inaverse that emits Ultrarradiant particles. This would normally destroy an Inaverse, but this one is much larger and has more
Jataverses
. The Reservoir is larger, and the Jataverses are insanely huge, with the large amount of Cyanite being used to balance the overflow of Yellorium. In Supercharged Inaverses, the Jataverses create Ultrablue Cyanite, a condensed form of Cyanite that is bluer than blue itself. It is incredibly stable, as well.
Uncharged Inaverse:
The polar opposite, an Uncharged Inaverse, provides little power to the
Jataverses
. In these Inaverses, there is a ton of Cyanite, which is actually stored in the Reservoir. These don't get a lot of light usually because they are in a forgotten part of the
Homaverse
, so it's usually empty. This reservoir has plenty of Magentite to neutralise the Cyanite. The Spokes are modified so they do NOT produce any Cyanite, but due to the low charge there are few surface
Jataverses
. These Inaverses tend to be a shae of red due to the Yellorium and Magentite.
Packed Inaverse:
These Inaverses are packed full of rings and spheres. In these Inaverses, the rings are so packed they form a kind of web, so spokes become almost pointless. As a result, the spokes gradually are absorbed, until the whole Inaverse's shell fades away to reveal a network of Jataverses connected by piping that moves Cyanite, Refined Radiance and other fluids. These Inaverses tend to be very habitable, but rare.
Sparse Inaverse:
These Inaverses are very sparse. They have few rings to beam Radiant Particles. Therefore, the spokes tend to send extremely poweful packets of light to each other. In fact, many of the spheres act as mini-reservoirs of Radiance in between the long distances. To function as a reservoir, a sphere must possess an Inaversal Prism, which is a rare product of a
Homaversal
Tree that contains the basic units for an Inaverse to form. Therefore natural Sparse Inaverses never exist. They form from Exploded Inaverses combining to form a Sparse or Packed Inaverse.

"Woohoo!" - Homer Simpson, from the beginning of The Simpsons
The Homaverse is a grid-shaped verse that is bent into spiral shapes. It contains many Homa-Trees and creatures of the Homaverse. The inhabitants and structure of the Homaverse is constantly shifting.
Homa-Trees
[
]
The Homa-Trees grow near the intersections of the Grid. They are obviously not regular trees, as they are made from Gamarite, the same material as the Homa-Grid. They grow in a perculiar pattern. They split into two branches, and each branch is half as large in all directions. On these branches, may grow mini-branches that point out, and this is where the Homaverse Tree Fruits grow. The Homa-Tree Fruits include:
Inaversal Prism:
The Inaversal Prism is essential for an
Inaverse
to form. It converts Radiant Particles into Refined Radiance.
Inabulb:
The Inabulb periodically flashes a burst of Ultrarradiant Particles. This is what powers the
Inaverses
.
Inaspreader:
Launches a branch extremely far like a rocket, which forms a new Homa-Tree.
Inafruit:
Inafruit is an extremely good energy source. It can be used for portal drives to create portals that go extremely far.
Inastone:
Inastones are very useful minerals. There are many kinds of Inastone, but by far the most common is Chaos, which is orange and makes things change and evolve extremely rapidly.
Inaverse
:
Sometimes, rarely, a Packed
Inaverse
may form on the Homa-Trees.
The Homa-Trees sap energy from the Homa-Grid, which distributes energy and matter. The Homa-Grid also feeds the Homa-Creatures. The Homa-Grid gets all its energy from the Gamavoid.
Homa-Creatures
[
]
There are many kinds of Homa-Creatures. They feed off the Homa-Grid, the Inafruits or other Homa-Creatures. Rarely, they may eat the
Inaverses
that live near the base of the Homa-Trees. Most Homa-Creatures, however, live off the grid. Homa-Creatures include the Homa-Shell, the Homa-Goo and the Homa-Simpson.
Homa-Shell:
These have a spiral structure like a mollusc, except with a luminous grid imprinted on their shells. Their shells are made of Gamarite. They eat dead Homa-Trees and Inafruit. Occasionally they may sprout wings. The inside of the shells, is always shifting. Due to their diet of Chaos Inastone, the inside takes an indescribable form.
Homa-Goo:
The Homa-Goo can reform itself at any time. Its made of goo, and it only eats the Inafruit or drinks from the Homa-Grid. It is often eaten by the Homa-Shell and Homa-Simpson, so it can reform itself and slither like a snake. This makes the Homa-Goo an incredibly fast creature, and it is aided by its ability to master the use of the Inafruit.
Homa-Simpson:
The Homa-Simpson is incredibly fat. It's the largest Homa-Creature, and eats any Homa-Creature,
Inaverse
or object it finds. It is extremely feared. It's only predator is the Homa-Nospims, which are much more intelligent and deadly, and live off the energy reservoirs (fat) in Homa-Simpsons
Homa-Fish:
Homa-Fish live in the giant parts of the grid, where it's super chaotic and always shifting. Here, with not many predators, they thrive. In fact, the chaos gives them energy to live. They eat, drink and live off the chaos.
Homa-Nospims:
Extremely intelligent, extremely deadly. These creatures have a built in weapon that can kill Homa-Simpsons extremely easily. They then absorb the energy reservoirs (fat) and eat it. They have a partnership with Homa-Trees. In return for keeping Homa-Simpson numbers low, the Homa-Trees allow the Homa-Nospims to stay inside them.
Homa-Trap:
The Homa-Trap looks alot like a Homa-Tree and acts like it. But in fact, the Homa-Trap has lightning-fast reaction times. Once a Homa-Creature comes to eat the fake tree or fake Inafruit, it fires an Ultrarradiant laser at the creature, vaporising it instantly. Beware: a Homa-Tree has
Inaverses
living below it. Otherwise, it's a Homa-Trap.
Homaversal Technology
[
]
Homaverses are often harnessed for power using their Homa-Grid. They have a unique connection to the Gamavoid that allows them to sap power from the deepest part of the Gamavoid, where otherwise Feesh would have been sucked in and DIED 💀⚰️😵

"What kind of fractal is this??? Is Alphasm drunk again?" -Random Guy #19½
The Gamaverse is the 42
nd
Archverse, and the 31
st
on this page. It takes the form of a fractal. For example, this 2D slice of it looks similar to the Burning Ship Fractal, but in fact its full 55D form is quite different, and the similarity is simply a coincidence. The Gamaverse is surrounded by a layer of Super-Gamarite, a green, more powerful version of Gamarite, the material of the Homaverse. The Super-Gamarite is immune to voidal effects and is a magnet for Gama-Particles, pulling them from the Gama-Void. So, first of all, let's talk about The Structure.
Structure of the Gamaverse
[
]
The Gamaverse has 2 main parts: The Inside and Outside. (wow that's crazy) The Outside, as we've mentioned, its made of complex structures of Super-Gamarite, which go deep into the Gama-Void and connect to the many
Homaverses
inside the Outside, connected by Gamarite Connectors. Living in the Gamaverse is a fine balance, as the Inside traps you forever never to be seen again, and the Outside is very dangerous, swept around by
Firaversal
Winds. Were it not for the structures forming a barrier and structure for
Homaverses
to grip onto, the
Homaverses
would be flung out of the
Firaverse
.
The Outside, however, is known as the Gamavoid, which is basically an eternal
limbo
for Gama-Particles. They fly around endlessly, until they find a 55D wormhole, which has many Super-Gamarite connectors. They are then sucked up by the connectors. The blackness of the void is misleading, in fact it's extremely bright; our
Hyperphoton
camera simply does not pick up Gama-Rays. The
limbo
appears to be infinite, and it's extremely hostile, and basically vaporises you instantly, due to the sheer quantity of Gama-Rays being sucked up. While the Gama-Void acts like a white hole for light, it acts like a black hole for matter and instantly ejects you outside of the wormhole into the endless void. Interestingly the Gama-void is shared and there's a wormhole for each Gamaverse. And the gravitation is not that strong, so it can easily be circumvented with a
AInTC
on warp drive no problem. The Gama-Void is not that useful for transport as the distance relationship is linear. So it really depends on whether you'd like to be flung out of the
Firaverse
or vaporised. Inside the Gama-Void, however, the wormholes stay fixed, irregardless of the motion of the
Firaverse
, which is perculiar.
It is currently debated where this energy comes from. The Gama-Void is not in the Fabric Dimension. Some think it might originate from the
Yindaverse
, or perhaps even the Source in the
Wholaverse
. As of now there is no other way to access the Gama-Void. Who knows where the Gama-Void might take us?
Materials of the Gamaverse
[
]
There are many special materials inside the Gamaverse.
Gamarite:
Gamarite is the material of the
Homaverse
. It's what makes up the Grid and Trees. Gamarite is naturally generated by the
Firaverse
from Firium. The Firium is a material that self-assembles into whatever shape is required. By surrounding a layer of Rayium with Firium, Gamarite is made. It's extremely efficient at storing, collecting and transporting energy in the form of Radiant Particles, such as Ultrarradiant Particles and Gama-Rays. It's extremely useful for super-batteries. There are, however, many other kinds of Gamarite.
Super-Gamarite
is the green kind, and it's made from Gamarite when it is exposed to Gama-Rays. This means that the Super-Gamarite gradually becomes more powerful and "magnetic", allowing the Gamaverse to eventually grow up into a
Firaverse
.
Rayium:
Rayium is made from Gama-Rays. The Rayium tends to take the color of the
Firaverse
, not the Gamaverse. This is because Rayium is made by the
Firaverse
. Rayium is a byproduct of the Firapipe, which is essential for the formation of a Gamaverse. When Gama-Rays are siphoned by the Firapipe, Rayium is made for efficient transportation to the
Firaverse
core. The pipe starts to create Gamarite on the inner layer, where it then expands into a structure of Gamarite and Super-Gamarite. The side where the Firapipe enters tends to be the same side of the Gamaverse that
Homaverses
form on.
Dynamium:
Dynamium is a material responsible for the chaos in
Homaverses
. Its a needed ingredient for Gamacite and a byproduct created by the Gamaverse. The Gamaverse naturally repels Dynamium, so as to not die.
Gamacite:
Gamacite is extremely volatile. Its used in combination with Dynamium and Rayium to act as a weapon, by drawing from a Gama-Ray store to fire a precise beam of Ultra Gama-Rays. These rays are so powerful they can cause damage to a
Firaverse
, and annihilate a Gamaverse. Specialised Gamaverses full of this Gamacite act as cannons, and the more Gamacite, the more powerful it is.
Bluium:
Bluium is named after the colour of our
Firaverse
, It allows for extremely efficient transportation of Gama-Rays. It's almost entirely made of compressed Rayium, Super-Gamrite and Firium. This material uses a TON of energy, and it not only allows for transportation by acting as a Firapipe, it creates new wormholes, which create new Gamaverses. This is essential for the creation of a
Firaverse
. It also allows Gama-Rays to be converted to Rayium
Xenorium:
Xenorium is a precursor to Firium. It allows Gama-Rays, to be converted into Firium. This is used during the last stage of a Gamaverse becoming a
Firaverse
, by converting the original Gamaverse into a core. Xenorium will allow the Gamaverse to convert Gamaverse materials into
Firaverse
materials
! WARNING !
Just like the Bonaverse, the Gamaverse contains multiple Tredaverses and Kiloverses. Do not go inside any Tredaverses or Kiloverses, as they are more unsafe compared to the ones inside the Sortaverse/Kindaverse/Megaverse.
Gama-Fax
[
]
Most Gamaverses are shifted compared to their
Firaverse
. Eg. a Blue
Firaverse
makes a Green Gamaverse, while a red
Firaverse
makes an purple one. Rarely they can make an orange one. However, a Green Gamaverse does not necessarily turn into a green or yellow
Firaverse
. That's effectively randomised. The Gamaverse in questionn turns white. As more Gamaverses are made the
Firaverse
eventually "decides" its color.
The Gamaverse holds a secret. The Gama-void may occasionally release a signal. The signals, as it turns out, are in a special language, which is the language of the
Firaverse
. You see the
Firaverse
is intelligent. Xenorium also allows Firaverses to gain some form of sentience. And inside the
Firaverse
Core, which is very dangerous, are inscriptions detailing the language and how to decode it.
If you listen to the signal, you will in fact hear a recording of
The Cosmic Truth
. That's right. Occasionally, there are many other signals possible. If you're far enough away it's usually nonsense, due to the noise of other Gama-Rays, but as you get closer, you will find that the
Firaverse
"controls" the Gama-Rays, and this is how it thinks. So, you can in fact communicate with the Firaverse. The Firaverse is intelligent and knows what goes on in the core, so all you need is a "listener" in the Void to communicate. Pretty cool, huh?

"FIRA IN THE HOLE!" -Fish
! WARNING !
The
Firaverses
are sick and tired of FIRA IN THE HOLE jokes. If they hear one more FIRA IN THE HOLE joke, they will personally accelerate you into the Gama-Void, where you will EXPIRE IN THE HOLE.
(Fish died due to unfunnyness)
The Firaverse is the 53
rd
Archverse. The Firaverse is filled with several
Gamaverses
that are connected to the Firaverse, and the entire Firaverse is in fact, a grown up
Gamaverse
. Just like the
Motaverse
, a Firaverse can move too. However, a Firaverse does not rotate, at least not relative to itself, if that makes any sense. This is unlike a
Motaverse
, which has layers that rotate independently of each other. If a Firaverse doesn't move, that means it is dead, or it has been "absorbed" by a Firaversal Complex, which we'll get to later. Firaverses fly around in a section of the
Emoaverse
called "The White Void", as there's so much space to occupy. Firaverses also have an opposite, a Firavoid, which fly in the Orange part of the
Emoaverse
, but this is not the
Emoaverse
's page and again. we'll get to that later. Firaverses can be almost any color, even unique colors that humans cannot perceive, or don't exist naturally on the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples include Magenta, Supergreen or even Loriac, which doesn't even exist as light. They look 3D to us, but are actually 56D. Just like the
Gamaverse
, the image you see is a cross-section of the Firaverse.
Firaverse Formation
[
]
Firaverses start out as
Gamaverses
on their parent Firaverse. The
Gamaverse
will spend a large portion of its life as a regular
Gamaverse
, with only one Gama-Void.
As a
Gamaverse
matures, the
Gamaverse
creates more Gamarite and Super-Gamarite, so it can grow much faster. This is the second phase of a
Gamaverse
's life before it becomes a
Gamaversal
Complex. The
Gamaverse
will spend approximately 3% of its time in this stage.
Eventually, a
Gamaverse
has become powerful enough to begin investing in more resources. Most
Gamaverses
die due to skill issues and leave behind Gama-Voids ripe for exploration. The
Gamaverse
creates Bluium, which allows the
Gamaverse
to spread to empty Gama-Void Portals, and even create new Gama-Voids.
The
Gamaverse
is now a
Gamaversal
Complex. Just like a Firaverse, a
Gamaversal
Complex creates Gama-Void Portals just full of Gamacite, which allows it to FIGHT. The
Gamaversal
Complex is now a formidable force.
The Firaverse helps the
Gamaversal
Complex create Xenorium, which turns the
Gamaverse
into a Firaverse Core, and makes it capable of thought, expansion, and make it much more advanced. At this point, the
Gamaversal
Complex is fully mature. However the Gama-Void itself is limited, and eventually so many portals exist that there are few Gama-Particles to absorb. Now that the
Gamaversal
Complex has matured, it's time to become a Firaverse.
The new Firaverse leaves its old Firaverse, starts its new Fira-Engines and seeks out new frontiers in the
Emoaverse
.
With Brains Comes War
[
]
Indeed, the Firaverse is sentient and alive, It controls Gama-Rays to create pulses, which stimulate thought. In fact, each Firaverse has its own language, passed down from its parent Firaverse with some tweaks. The details are written in inscriptions etched into the Core, which make it think. But there is one question you may be asking. Unlike
Motaverses
, which have no will and move because they were born to move, a Firaverse can control its movement. Most organisms move to find food and water, but the Firaverse has unlimited energy, so why move? Well, the simple reason is predators. A Firaverse can often wage wars on other Firaverses, in order to kill them and expand the complex, into a Firaversal Complex. The Firaversal Complex then assimilates the
Gamaverses
inside the dead Firaverse, making it much more powerful.
So why do Firaverses want to make more Firaverses? It's the same reason life exists. Life that will go to any length to ensure the survival of its body, its tribe and its kin. Because any organism that DOESN'T actively try and spread their genetic material and survive, simply stops existing. And the only ones left are those that try and not die. This is the meaning of life. To not die. So if you're alive and reading this, good job! 👍 You're alive-ing, thriving and that's all the universe needs from you.
However, there is one kind of Firaverse that hates this. It thinks the destruction of Firaverses is simply unethical. It has a distinct color, and they are the White Firaverse. The White Firaverse is unlike a Firaversal Complex in that each Firaverse is an individual, and intertwined with Gama-Tubing to make a 56D giant Firaverse. It's extremely advanced and keeps on recruiting and growing in size. They have been at war with Firaversal Complexes for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, loong, looong, loooong, looooong, loooooong, looooooong, loooooooong, looooooooong, loooooooooong, looooooooooong, loooooooooooong, (a long long amount of "long"s),

time. Very long! The White Firaverse is not even the only one! In every region of the
Emoaverse
there are at least 6 of these. In our
Emoaverse
section, they are mostly white, so they are called the White Firaverse Alliance. Most are some shade of white, while some are red, magenta, or even multicolour. They all share different views on this issue and have different methodologies. They are extremely advanced. The White Firaverse Alliance in particular, have an arch nemesis called Bob, which in the common language of the WFA actually means "Harbringer of Destruction, Eater of Souls". Bob is massive. He's many times larger than the White Firaverse, and they were created around the same time. Despite Bob's size, the White Firaverses are actually winning gradually, as they are currently growing much faster than Bob. Despite this, it'll probably take them a Long
3
time (aka a longlonglonglong... for a longlonglonglong... for an Omega Long time ...longlong time ... longlong time, which is 3 nested Longlayers), but is much shorter than the Long
4
time that they have been at war.
Firaverse Components
[
]
The Edges
: The edges of the Firaverse contain most of the
Gamaverses
in the Firaverse, and pretty much all of the "Weapon"
Gamaverses
, which are full of Gamacite. They are connected via a dense network of Fira-Pipe Bundles, which contain nested Fira-Pipe Bundles, etc. The actual Fira-Pipes are about as wide as a
Gamaverse
, which is about as small compared to a Firaverse, as a grain or rice is compared to a
Gamaverse
, if a grain or rice was the size of a
Gamaverse
!!! The size of a Firaverse is the size of a
Gamaverse
cubed!
The Energisers:
These are built in to every Firaverse, and are much more powerful than a Weapon
Gamaverse
. Depending on the Firaverse, they can have the power to damage or instantaneously annihilate a Firaverse. However they can only be used for a short time, basically drain the Firaversal Energy Store (The one that's supposed to last an Omega Long time). Firaverses that invest in the weapon part tend to move slower and have the Firaversal Energy Store last shorter, as them even existing takes a huge toll on the energy production. Energisers also have another purpose. They contain the Fira-Engines, which allow the Firaverse to rotate and move around.
The Bases:
On the base of Energisers, exist the Bases. These function as the Firaversal Energy Store, and are used to charge up the Energisers. If the Bases have excess power, it will use the Energisers to reroute Ultra Gama-Rays through the Frame. This then routes it through the Core, which converts Gama-Rays to Firium, which goes to the Edges, to boost growth of the
Gamaverse
. If the Core is overloaded with energy, it may overheat and melt. So, the Bases may also decide to burn energy with the Energisers. The bases are critical, so that power surges in the Gamavoid are taken care of, and
Gamaverses
can be supplied with energy in case of a shortage.
The Frame
: The Frame connects the Edges, Bases and Flower via an ultra-fast network of Fira-Pipes. The Frame also possesses 8-12 Fira-Diamonds, which connect the core, and can fulfill most minor tasks that the Core can do, as they are full of Xenorium. For example, the Fira-Diamonds can create Firium, and convert most materials. It can handle the basic routing duties of the Core, so that the Core can concern itself with other things. The Fira-Diamonds also serve as a way for the Core to communicate with the rest of the Firaverse.
The Flower
: The flower is a dense network of sub-Cores, that is full of gigantic
Gamaverses
. Like some Archverses, the Firaverse is evolving. The Flower is often full of experiements, where the Firaverse creates new particles that could make it faster, larger, etc. Some of the oldest Firaverses have become so advanced they have Kardashevs of 3850+ on their own! One example is Gaq'othr. He is so old, in fact, that he came from ANOTHER older
Emoaverse
, watched it DIE, and moved to ours. He rules a considerable region of the WFA, called the Gaq'farogn, which is located near the edge of the WFA. Anyways, we're getting very off topic.
The Core
: This is the center of the Firaverse. It contains a GINOURMOUS Gama-Void portal, surrounded by a giant white
Gamaverse
that became white. The Core is extremely dangerous for Feesh to exist in, as it is very hot. Due to this, the Core is always at risk of overheating, so the Flower exists to take heat away. The Core, as we've discussed, is extremely intelligent. It thinks by taking in Gama-Rays from the Gama-Void to create though. It knows everything happening in the Gama-Void and Firaverse, because it receives information from the Fira-Diamonds.
Voids:
Except for the Gama-Void portal in the center most of the black areas are actual space. And this is because there is a high risk of energy overflux. If too many Gama-Particles exist in a region, it may start creating Gama-Void portals where you don't want them, due to the sheer amount of flux. This principle is what makes Bluium work.
The White Firaverse Alliance.
[
]
In the "With Brains Comes War" section we detailed the WFA. But let's just go a little more detailed into this section, because yes. The WFA takes the form of a giant Firaverse-looking thing. However, there's much less structure. The Edges is made up of a long line of Energisers or receptacles to absorb matter and information about the outside world. It's split up into multiple regions, with Firaverses inside having special jobs. For example, there are Firaverses with gigantic Fira-Pipes and many Gama-Void portals, which normally would cause chaos, but they have state of the art WFA Pipes to pipe energy out. We have extremely old Firaverses who have discovered technologies beyond the level of an
Emoaverse
-faring civilisation. We have Firaverses that grow extremely fast, allowing the WFA conglomerate to create tentacles to absorb even more Gama-Rays. And it's connected by WFA Pipes, a kind of Fira-Pipe that can transport anything through a Firaverse in less than a second. Unlike a Firaverse Conglomerate, there is no one central core, but rather a disorganised array of intertwined individuals connected by a grid of WFA pipes. However, one drawback is space is limited and WFA pipes are expensive. So it was originally very hard to grow the WFA, as doing so without walls would result in you getting eaten by... BOB.
Bob
[
]
Bob is a Firaverse Conglomerate, a Firaverse that kills and absorbs Firaverses to become massive. His name might seem innocuous, but in fact the name means "Harbringer of Destruction, Eater of Souls" in the common langauge of the WFA. There are many such Firaverse Conglomerate, but over the past Long
3
time (aka a longlonglonglong... for a longlonglonglong... for an Omega Long time ...longlong time ... longlong time, which is 3 nested Longlayers), if you haven't read the "With Brains Comes War" chapter, Bob has eaten. EVERYTHING. He's been eating many Firaverses in the Second Gray Sector of the Enclosed Region 21 in the Spiral Conglomerate #[HOM]-NULL of our
Emoaverse
, which is the region Bob and the WFA live. Thankfully, we live in the First Black Sector, so we were spared from his wrath. When a Firaverse Conglomerate kills a Firaverse, almost 97% of the
Gamaverses
are destroyed due to severe damage, overflux due to panic mode, and desruction of the Framework. We're lucky we weren't unlucky.
why did i make a meme of myself 💀💀💀
"I have seen destruction, sensless destruction for petty reasons. Destruction by civilisations who think they're so great, so powerful... only to be snuffed out the next second, by forces they could never fathom. I have been watching you. I have also seen you destroy cosmoses, full of life, for things such as power. Every disaster that has struck these parts, you have survived it. You have been lucky countless times, and I have been lucky. But all it takes is one mishap. One super-powerful civilisation to trip on a rock and take out this godforsaken place permanently. And it will take me with it, and it will take you with it, and it will take everything with it. Just know you are not the first. Yes, I have seen many civilisations in my time here, and to each of them I told the same thing, and each of them left this place to search for more land. The cosmos is infinite. There are infinite cosmoses, infinite civilisations, all vastly more powerful than you. The only thing that protects us is size. Every time a
Gamaverse
, as you call it, is destroyed, there is a small chance that
Gamaverse
contained a budding civilisation. But that chance is slim, as there are so many of them. I do not wish to destroy things. I do not wish to expand infinitely, if the that exapnsion is at the expense of others. All I can do, is preserve what we have now, as best as I can, and I suggest that you do too. Do not waste your time worrying about the end of things. Instead act to make your time valuable and memorable, so others may look upon your remains and learn to become a better version of themselves. Because you never know if the next second... will be your last."

"Alright, now how do you pronounce this?" - EDAR Member 320
The Emoaverse is the 54
th
Archverse, and 43
rd
in the EDA chain. As expected, there are spirals. Fractal spirals. However, there's one thing that is unique: Half of it is almost devoid of matter, yet half of it is completely full of matter. As was detailed in the
Firaverse
article, inside the "Orange" regions, it is mostly filled with Firavoids, which are empty patches where there is no matter. Inside the "Orange" regions, is a special kind of liquid called
Emoa-Fluid.
However, this is not the section for this.
The Emoaverse is composed of various levels. It is made of a Frame, and the Frame is composed of many Spiral Conglomerates, which in turn contain Spirals. It then contains regions, which can either be white or orange, and are further subdivided into Sectors, which indicate where it is inside the Region, usually referred to with a color standard (Gray, White/Orange, Black, etc.) In the case of a Region spanning multiple Spiral Conglomerates, it is either "contained" by the Spiral Conglomerate where most of its volume is closest to, OR if you are talking about a point inside the region, the Spiral Conglomerate that point belongs to. This standard can get confusing, so some may also simply say "spanning Conglomerates X, Y, Z and W".
To avoid mixing, Emoa-Fluid,
Firaverses
and Firavoids are strongly repelled. This leads to dark regions, where not much exists. However, the "voids" are white. The Emoaverse is a EDA that contains a relatively large amount of smaller EDAs with respect to its vast size. Due to how many
Firaverses
exist in the voids, it is almost guaranteed a
Hyperphoton
from a camera, would reflect off a
Firaverse
, or a
Firaverse
would emit a high-energy beam at the camera. For this reason, the voids are almost always brighter, at to a
Hyperphoton
lens. (With the exposure way up, of course).
Emoa-Fluid
[
]
Remember when I said that the
Firaverse
was, in a sense, a fully living and intelligent -verse? Well, the Fira-Voids are also likely fully living and intelligent, as they seem to like wandering around the yellow part of the Emoaverse, motivating the ones that spawned in the white part to enter it, resulting in inevitable explosion. The yellow matter is really strong, but seem to be some kind of Non-Newtonian fluid called "Emoa-Fluid". They can for some reason be pushed easy apart by voids, which is possibly why the Firavoids like to fly around there, not propelled by anything. The Firavoids also create "footprints", slightly darker spots in the yellow part. The footprints eventually "heal" themselves, but it's REALLY unlikely that one will fully heal, as uncountable amounts of Firavoids are constantly flying around. It is beyond impossible for anything else to enter the orange part. Additionally, when a Firavoids enters the yellow part it typically cannot exit ever again due to the Firaverses outside pushing it back in. Lastly, Emoa-Fluid seems to disintegrate ANYTHING that is smaller than a Firaverse that touches it, even a slight brush.
The Conflict of Colors
[
]
A Firaverse and a Firavoid, if collided, will basically explode. The White and Orange parts WILL immediately start going into a war upon the creation of an Emoaverse, and they'll use Firaverses/Firavoids (depends on which side) to fight eachother to cause explosions in the enemy side. The White part is constantly pushing the Orange part, which is always trying to stay rigid in spite of the white part. Most of the time, if a Firaverse or a Firavoid tries to cross the the border between the two sides, they instantly die. The borders are constantly creating them, almost completely blocking access to eachother. When any of the two sides win, it ends catastrophic for the Emoaverse. For the white side, the lack of matter will make the Emoaverse run out of power, making it slowly shrink, compressing everything in it until it becomes a horrendously humongous blackhole. If the orange side wins (which has been found out to be a slightly rare case), the Emoaverse will collapse due to there being too much mass, "dying" in an unknown way. The remaining Firaverses do not die after the death of its Emoaverse. However, Firaverses, to stay alive have to be in the enviornment of an Emoaverse, so rogue ones do not survive very long, unlike rogue Grinaverses, which have been discovered to stay alive, even billions of eternities after the death of an Emoaverse and every Firaverse that was in it. The Emoaverse can sometimes go into a "Crisis Mode" if the war between the two colors gets too bad. All we know is taht in this mode, it'll start shrinking (not that fast) and attempt to destroy EVERY Firaverse and Firavoid in it, slowly annihilating itself. Even though most Firaverses die in this process. A rare case is a Firaverse slipping through, in which it will eject everything as a last resort, hoping for the contents to eventually die due to not being able to survive outside of the Emoaverse environment, but most of the time they get picked up by other remaining Emoaverses. There is no way to easily tell if an Emoaverse is in "Crisis Mode". This is what happened to Gaq'othr, by the way.

"What a peaceful turn compared to the last EDA." - Someone, probably
The Daxaverse is the 55
th
Archverse, and 44
th
in the EDA chain. The EDA is split into two sides: The cyan side and the orange side, which are both sentient and quite peaceful to eachother. They're usually trading eachother territory by sticking out "tentacles" (as seen in the image). If there's an imbalance, both sides will relentlessly try to make it equal to prevent possible conflict. One side is made of matter and one side is made of antimatter. For places where the orange and yellow sides are touching, there is a barrier to prevent stuff from accidentally destroying eachother. Both side also have their "eyes" which are scattered everywhere throughout them. However, this is not always the case (it's more like most of the time, this is the case). Sometimes, both sides are in constant war and sometimes, both sides are just doing nothing. On extremely rare occasions, one side can not have sentience, resulting in total domination of the other.
There is also some sort of telepathic computer, telling each side how much territory they have. It constantly updates every planck time and will send a blaring alarm that only the Daxaverse can hear if there's an imbalance in territory. The telepathic computer seems to be completely indestructible, unless you're in a Bofaversian civilization. The place of the Telepathic computer is constantly shifting as to stay in the middle of both sides. Whenever a Daxaverse is formed, the telepathic computer is formed at the middle, and both sides start out as one, big eye to create their own territory, and the rest is void. Typically, a Daxaverse never gets full of these sides, unless it's one of the very first few Daxaverses. Sometimes, higher Daxaversian civilizations can control the telepathic object, granting access to control of the entire EDA. This usually ends in chaos as they often end up making the alarm blare, resulting in an eternal imbalance that can't be noticed. If a Daxaverse is imbalanced for far too long and there's an ongoing conflict between the two sides, an unknown entity will step in and destroy the entire thing. Thankfully, this has only been seen twice, which also sadly made information about the entity scarce.
In addition to managing space in three dimensions, the sides also manage space in all 59 dimensions, including the extra ones. Each dimension has its own big eye to control the side. This usually results in alarms blaring quite alot: Imagine managing an office with 59 lazy workers and 81 on top of that. You have an alarm that blares when one of them falls asleep. Of course, you will have to dash to one to wake them up, but going to them will buy time for another to fall asleep, resulting in very frequent alarms. That is like both sides managing their territory. Additionally, most of the time many imbalances happen simultaneously, increasing the sound of the alarm. When all 59+81 dimensions are balanced all alarms will stop. A slip-up is really easy for an eye to do, but it is often immediately noticed by the other side, so problems usually get solved in probably like a second to them.
Types Of Daxaverses
[
]
Note that a Daxaverse doesn't stay in one type forever; sometimes a HUGE slip-up can cause it to change.
PEACEFUL:
The most common Daxaverse type, with 9628 in 10000 Daxaverses being of this type. As usual, the orange and cyan sides are peacefully trading eachother territory, granting a 50/50 split of matter and antimatter. Of course, as I said, the 59+81 dimensions cause easy slip-ups for both sides that can easily be fixed. No conflict happens with no unfairness for the normal side and the antimatter side.
TENSE:
A slightly uncommon Daxaverse type, with 201 in 10000 Daxaverses meeting the criteria to get this type. Daxaverses in this type have the 2 sides usually not fixing slip-ups immediately, so there's usually a constant alarm blaring for it. This can be caused by a slightly HUGE slip-up, but can be fixed. If more slip-ups are done, it can advance to the next state. An average distribution of sides for these Daxaverses are about 45/55.
COMBATIVE:
Daxaverses that are ready to have a war, Even more uncommon than the previous, with 95 Daxaverses in 10000 being this type. There's even more imbalance and the blaring alarms are usually gone, as the telepathic computer is very likely destroyed. One side is constantly taking a small part of eachother, with another trying to take a bigger part. The center of both sides is always shifting due to conflict. It's quite difficult to return to Tense at this point and usually, they end up in the next type after a few more years for the 2 big eyes. A common distribution for both side is about 35/65, constantly fluctuating.
HOSTILE:
At this point, it is really difficult to return to the previous type. These Daxaverses are now in actual war, with both sides taking big parts of eachother back and forth. One thing I forgot to mention is that the big eyes are sentient, and will often throw insults and threats to the big eyes of the other side. An example recorded by an EDA Researcher, relentlessly translated into english is: "You'll fall". After a few more years for the Daxaverse, it is guaranteed that it will advanced onto the 5th stage. Daxaverses in this state progressively have higher and higher tensions that are constantly rising, which is why it is hard for a Daxaverse to return to Combative after this. A common distribution can't be made and 44 out of 10000 Daxaverses are in this state.
AGGRESSIVE:
This is where hostility between the sides is REALLY visible. Only 22 out of 10000 Daxaverses are in this state: The most common thing in these Daxaverses is seeing a side taking a HUGE part of another with the other side retailiating by taking an equally large side, sometimes even between dimensions. The big eyes nad normal ones also step in: They will begin moving their places to personally have attack the eyes that belong to the other side. It is almost impossible for an Aggressive Daxaverse to return to the Hostile state. After a few more years (again), for the Big Eyes, of course, they are sure doomed to be destroyed by the unknown creature.
DOOMED:
The same thing as the last one, but slightly higher tensions and of course worse conflict. Rarity of 10 out of 1000 Daxaverses (equal to 1 in a thousand). The void parts will actually begin coming back due to the attacks, sometimes disconnecting the sides from eachother for a few eternities, then they are for sure coming back together for even more conflict. It is impossible to make a Daxaverse return to Aggressive. They are shortly then completely destroyed by the unknown creature, due to a recent risk that a Doomed Daxaverse can spread the war to another Daxaverse (through one side communicating with eachother in some very obscure ways) that was once spotted by an EDA Researcher. The difficulty of making an average side distribution for these Daxaverses is beyond impossible.
What We Know About The Entity
[
]
2 reports have confirmed these:
The entity can freely fly anywhere it wants.
It seems to look like a mutated human.
It can destroy Daxaverses using insanely powerful energy orbs.
The entity sometimes visits normal Daxaverses and place an "eye" on it.
I apologize if the info is very scarce.

"IS ALPHASM DRUNK AGAIN???? THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING LIKE A FRACTAL!!!111" - Local overly long pattern fan, 2025
The Charaverse is the
56
th
archverse (and 45
th
in the EDA chain) and is divided into 5 sections: The Daxa-Section, which stores Daxaverses, the Shard Section which stores the Charashards as seen in the image, The Safeguard Section which houses the practically infinite protectors of the Charaverse, The Computation Section that features a giant computer way more powerful than the one in the Kamaverse and the Plamaverse, and the Mainframe which is where the entire thing is managed by itself. Every Charaverse has a different section arrangement, but the Mainframe is always in the center, so that the Charaverse can easily access it.
The Charaverse is also sentient, but it can't move or spin around like the previous ones. Instead, the Charaverse uses the Charashards to power itself or other stuff, the Construct to simulate stuff such as disasters, what would happen if a Charashard was used, how the protectors would work in different cases and so on. Once in a while, it will do DRASTIC changes to itself. This is done with the Mainframe. The Mainframe is where the entire thing is controlled, but so far only the Charaverse itself has been able to access it. Sometimes, if a threat is powerful enough it will step in and start using the Charashards to attack it to assist the protectors.
The Protectors are a special species that the Charaverse can easily summon. They are dormant, until the Charaverse awakens them through the mainframe. Using their relentless arsenal, they'll fight the threat until it is reduced to just atoms. The Protectors sometimes visit Daxaverses to check on how technologically advanced they are, and if they're too advanced and seemingly can destroy the entire thing, that Daxaverse will also be reduced to atoms. I forgot to mention that the Charaverse is ruthless, so good luck if you become enemies with it.
Also, with the killing of threats comes expansion. An object called the "Soul Collector" exists in the Mainframe, and every death of a Charaversal Threat adds 1 to it. The number of the counter contributes to how powerful and large the Charaverse is. A Soul Collector has no limit as to how many souls it can have, but the power progression becomes harder the higher the counter is. At one point, it'll take TWICE the amount of souls just for a very tiny amount of size. Lastly, size seems to have a limit at some point. The number is currently unknown, but it is theorized to be 10^2^56 light years.
Daxa-Section
[
]
The simplest of the five. It just contains Daxaverses. There's not much other than that it can contain every EDA below it. It's also quite the dense area. I'm sure that not even a Protoverse can fit in there at this point!
Shard Section
[
]
This one is quite the complexity jump from the last one. It features 8 types of well, crystals. The crystals are used by the Charaverse for many purposes, and YOU can also use them, but you have to get the Charaverse to trust you with them first, they're really powerful anyway. If you are spotted using it without the Charaverse's trust... I don't know what happens, really.
Korjaus
: Korjaus is the first Characrystal. In cases where part of the Charaverse is destroyed, the Korjaus Characrystal can be used to immediately fix it.
Taistelu
: When shot at an enemy, Taistelu instantly makes a really powerful explosion that can destroy threats that can destroy even Daxaverses. Often used to assist protectors.
Luominen
: Luominen can create new protectors, new Daxaverses and more resources for The Construct, basically whatever the Charaverse will ever need to build.
Laajennus
: The Laajennus crystal can be used to expand a Charaverse, typically to either store more objects or just more space for the what is in it to prevent black hole creation.
Poistaminen
: Poistaminen crystals, if shot at a Daxaverse can instantly delete it from reality. Useful in cases where a Daxaverse is in the Doomed
Vahvuus
: This Characrystal, upon destruction near a protector will make it much stronger. Loads of these are often used when they are fighting a threat.
Liikenne
: Capable of instantaneous transportation throughout the entire Charaverse. You'll just have to somehow tell it where you want to go.
Sekalaiset
: The most multi-use one of the eight. This one is for functions that do not have a crystal and is quite the rare sight to see.
Safeguard Section
[
]
Ever heard of military forces? Well, it's like that. There are KGJHPILLIONS of Protectors stationed at all times here, but they don't just sit there in the void! Instead, there are entire barracks for them to be contained, with special empty Daxaverses that are large enough to house one. There are also some other weapons they use, but since there's probably like trillions of different types of weapons, I'll only list 10 of them, as Fandom pages can only have up to 2 megabytes worth of content, and it's pretty easy to see that listing all trillion of them will be way beyond the limit in every single way.
Some weird laser-shooting machine that spins millions of full revolutions every second.
A self-moving turret that shoots a laser-like chain of homing bullets that also explode.
A machine that emits an aura that disintegrates everything that isn't more powerful than a Protector that comes into the aura.
Another really weird turret that can shoot bullets not from itself. Huh???
For some reason, there are zones that can shoot objects around that also seem like weapons.
"Vehicles" that can shoot a mini-version of themselves.
Turrets that shoot lasers in every direction, but not in the way you think.
A device that can immediately swap the positions of 2 entities.
A turret that once activated, never stops shooting. It can also fire anything.
The Protectors themselves are also weapons. They can transform their 2 arms into any of their arsenal. Additionally, Protectors can also fuse together to create a really powerful one.
Computation Section
[
]
A computer with currently unknown purposes. It features a screen. What we can see is that there are multiple applications open: "Variables", "Settings", "Main variable", "Functions", "Montreal", "Hyper-Montreal", "Omegamontreal" and "Subjugate & Forest". We can see 4 variables on the screen, but they seem to be set to unknown string values.
Mainframe
[
]
The mainframe is an inaccessible part of the Charaverse. It contains the Construct, which as said is made to simulate things and the Soul Collector, which has also already been explained. However, a curious feature are the Crystals of Reality. From an observation, they appear to be versions of the Charaverse in different scenarios. A theory about what the Charaverse uses these for is that they are produced by the Construct.

"Feesh, what the hell is this?"

CLaxtiel
, 2024
The Bofaverse, which is the 57
th
archverse (and 46
th
in the EDA chain), takes the form of two conjoined hyperspheres, which are filled to the brim with a thick liquid named Charafluid. The Bofaverse is home to a perculiar, roughly Universe-sized species called Bophades that live on the surface of the Bofaverse. They communicate in a low-pitched language that took a while for Feesh to decipher.
The Bophades
[
]
The Bophades have a unique culture that is very focused on food. Their main ingredient in all their dishes is a collection of red and blue pebbles nicknamed "Bophades Nuts" by the Feesh, due to their small size and nutty aroma. They have unique flavours that change as you chew them, and can sometimes even grant temporary hallucinations, euphoria or even sudden wisdom and clarity. Interestingly, if one type is eaten without the other, it can cause severe pain and sometimes even instant death. It is possible to grind the nuts to mitigate this, but the Bophades claim that the nuts have a unique taste that is muted if you grind them up.
Inside the Bofaverse
[
]
Inside the Bofaverse, the two hyperspheres are conjoined by a small tube. The walls of the Bofaverse are incredibly hard to break and get harder the deeper you drill.
Inside each of the hyperspheres, all the Charaverses are suspended in a thick, translucent fluid. At the intersection, there exists a Portable Reality Engine. It's a Reality Engine similar to the Avantaverse's giant Reality Engine, used for inhabiting deep space. We like in the L Sphere, but in the R sphere, all the Charaverses and their crystals are flipped, meaning that everything is opposite. Now, if you flip Charaverse, you still get Charaverse. But the same is not true inside. When you enter said Crystals, you actually start inside the tiniest finite thing - the outside of an inverted subatomic particle, like a quark. Trying to escape will just lead to nothing. But, if you shrink yourself, you will enter an inside-out Inuverse. Every law of physics is inverted and every characteristic about every verse inside the R sphere is 100% opposite.
Inside the Inuverse, which is a flipped Universe, everything is opposite and it's contained by a quark and contains many Miltuverses. The Miltuverses are 100% opposite, but they're quite generic. They contain a Mageverse. As you shrink and shrink, you reach more verses, like an Echaverse becomes an Acheverse. It contains a Dranuverse and is contained by a Frameverse. It's an unordered collection of uniform solid Dranuverses with random shapes. Or a Veptaverse is now a Vapteverse. It contains an Achuverse and is contained by a Waxeverse. It's a stagnant lattice of Achuverses. Etc, etc. Once you shrink to 10
-2
55.60
ly, inside a Daxeverse, you exit the crystal in the R sphere.
Formation of the Bofaverse
[
]
The Bofaverse formation is brutal. The Avantaverse is full of holes, and inside these holes, Bofaverses form. The hyperspheres have two kinds: R and L. L Spheres are created near the outside, while R Spheres are created at the other end. They are attracted to each other, and they must find a pairing before they violently explode and are reabsorbed by the Avantaverse. In this race for survival, most "Spheres" die. But for the lucky Bofaverses that do survive this process, they exit the Avantaverse Hole to venture out into the deep space. Over their lifetime, as Charaverses die, they will shrivel up, and shrink until the Bofaverse is no more, releasing its energy into the cosmos.
Overall, our Bofaverse is an incredibly interesting verse. The nuts are said to be one of the best foods in the whole Avantaverse, so, if you'd like to taste something out of this world, try Bophades nuts.

"Guys, I'm not dead!" - penthexium56
The Avantaverse is the 58
th
Archverse (and 47th in the EDA chain), is a "living" organism -verse, with holes, pylons, topography and so on. There's also really tiny ones that float around in the Zimaverse that doesn't have any of these due to being too small. For more information, check the text 2 lines below for some more explanation. The features also causes the archverse to look like a virus, even though they aren't at all.
The features of the Avantaverse allow it to be able to shoot out stuff really fast. Things cannot go back in the Avantaverse after they're shot out, as there's a constant force shooting everything out in the holes and pylons. The two shoot out different things: Holes are used for bad Bofaverse discarding and Pylons are used to shoot out powerful energy beams that can severly damage a part of another Avantaverse. More info in their section. This can cause a war between Avantaverses, by the way. Refer to 2 lines below.
Mini-Avantaverses are a rare variant that currently has an unknown process of creation. They do not have the holes and the pylons due to being too small to have them. However, they have been reported to be moving rapidly across the Zimaverse it is in. A normal Avantaverse can destroy a mini one through the mini one crashing into a normal one. This slightly damages the normal one, creating a crater at where it landed.
Avantaversal Wars are a now thankfully impossibly rare occurence that is often started when an Avantaverse accidentally shoots one of its lasers, hitting another one. Here's how they often went:
It starts off with one Avantaverse accidentally shooting another with an extremely powerful laser at another while trying to destroy bad Bofaverses, which triggers the other.
The other Avantaverse responses with a laser aimed directly at the core of the Avantaverse that shot it, which increases tensions further.
After some back and forth shooting, it is very likely that the wrong pylon will shoot a laser, hitting another Avantaverse, which will also likely do the same, spreading more and more.
Eventually, every single Avantaverse in a Zimaverse will be shooting at eachother, causing a catastrophic event that will take eternities to recover from.
There's also two The Bread-like entities that govern the entire Avantaverse.
Features
[
]
Holes:
Every single Avantaverse has several holes, marked by the yellow spots on them. They are often misinterpreted as entrances to the inside of the Avantaverse, but instead the holes are a one way exit. In short: If you exit an Avantaverse, you won't be able to return unless you join some Zimaversal civilization, which has enough advanced technology to create portals/wormholes that lead to the interior of one. Additionally, an Avantaverse sometimes will discard "bad" Bofaverses that may have civilizations trying to destroy it by shooting them out into the void. And yes, they are so small that they can't even be seen as they are shrunk after being shot out.
Pylons:
The pylons are these red tower-like things on the purple sphere that is the main Avantaverse. They're similar to holes, but they do not shoot out Bofaverses. Instead, they shoot out wildly powerful energy beams that can even severely damage a part of another Avantaverse. Thankfully, the Avantaverses have evolved to have extreme precision, which has heavily reduced the amount of wars between Avantaverses. In addition to that, they're also a one-way door, just like the holes where you can't return after exiting unlessyouareazimaversalcivilizationthatcandothat. In rare cases, the pylons can shoot out the tiny Avantaverses seen in the picture, typically one at a time and one per who knows how long.
Topography:
The topography of the exterior Avantaverse of course, has the yellow holes and the red pylons around it. As expected, the distance between them is so large that you'll usually only get to see one of them if you're a normal-sized human. A bunch of researchers have described the ground as similar to grass, but with a mix of extreme fuzziness and the feeling of disintegration. It has also been reported that the areas around holes seem to be indescribably hot, enough to make a Bofaverse nonexistent. In contrast, the area around the pylons are very cold to the point where everything that is smaller than a hole completely stops moving.
The Core:
Every Avantaverse has atleast one Core. The core can produce TRILLIONS of Bofaverses in just one plank length. Multiply that up to a second and you'll see the sheer magnitude of the creation speed. The core also supplies the pylons with the energy lasers and the outer topography the disintegrating sensation. The core can only be destroyed by the most upper-level Zimaversal civilization, as it can infinitely quickly regenerate itself even if only 0.0000001% of it is only remaining. The Core has been described to be glowing an insanely bright light and is just as hot as the center of a hole, with something kinda like The Bread inside.
The Interior:
Where the Bofaverses reside. The space consists of... nothing. What did you even expect??? However, it has a special property that allows the Bofaverses to freely move around. The Bofaverses are also coated with a certain object that makes it so that they never collide, causing a catastrophic explosion. The edges have the same disintegrating sensation as the outside ground, but it actually disintegrates stuff. The interior's temperature is reported to be around 31 degrees Celsius, even though there is a blazing hot orb in it. Also, the air acts if the place is underwater, so beings are often spotted swimming around in it to explore the Avantaverses. The edges also have slightly darker spots that can be opened to the outside of an Avantaverse with enough power.
The Cheese
[
]
The Cheese is an entity that controls an Avantaverse. He has an invisible command board with many functions that allow him to do stuff like: Ejecting bad Bofaverses or creating more of them, shooting lasers at enemies, moving around the Avantaverse he is in, basically anything you can do with an Avantaverse. The Cheese can do mitosis; he does this so "grab" a Bofaverse and do a routine inspection on it. The Cheese can mitose into googologically high amounts of arms in just seconds, and the arms can extend practically infinitely long. The Cheese does not like outsiders. Of course, he can't notice them instantaneously but once he sees them; it's over. He will use one of his arms to absolutely disintegrate the invader. He doesn't care what it is; He doesn't like anything new coming into his Avantaverse. He also has a friend, The Butter. The Butter is constantly powering up the entire Avantaverse as he can emit just enough energy for that. He is how The Cheese works. Without him, the Avantaverse can't do anything due to no control from The Cheese, and the Avantaverse could be easily destroyed by a bad Bofaverse as it is unable to be ejected. The Butter also sometimes visits other Avantaverse, sometimes to steal Bofaverses.

Woo, another letter cycle!" - Some guy named Zima
The Avantaverse is the 59
th
Archverse (and 48th in the EDA chain) and is pretty much a way larger version of everything up until Avantaverse. It's a colony of Avantaverse that forms BIG multicellular life that lives on BIG islands made of Avantaverses that are on BIG planets, ditto, that are in BIG galaxies inside BIG universes and so on until we reach a BIG Zimaverse, which doesn't cause a recursion by the way. The BIG Zimaverse is the actual thing and it's a void of the BIG stuff. Lastly, the BIG multicellular life are also made of BIG atoms made of BIG protons and neutrons and so on. The special part about these BIG objects is that they act way differently from their normal counterparts.
How are Avantastructures made?
[
]
You see the black background in the Avantaverse image? These are the walls of the "fake Zimaverse". They are very tiny, well according to an actual Zimaverse particles that can form the structures as seen above and below. They bind together permanently and it seems as of only Yindaversal and upper civilizations can take one out of its place.
Notable Avantastructural Object Changes
[
]
Animals seem to have not just hundreds, not just billions, but MECILLIONS of variants. From a pink dog with yellow stripes and 6 eyes to a "creature" that isn't physical or virtual but is rather on an entirely different plane of reality.
Structures that are made of Avantaverses are extraordinarily rare due to the fact that creatures are pretty random. All of the Avantastructural civilizations that we have found spoke unknown, indecipherable languages. We only have learned one letter of one of these Avantaverse languages.
New states of matter seem to appear. The water on the planets in the picture aren't water - but could be pretty much anything.
Star systems can have way more than a googol planets as seen in the picture, and may have weird orbits.
Way more star and universe types.
Galaxies can be any shape, even 69-dimensional.
Universes can be any size.
Pretty much every other -verse up to a BIG Zimaverse can be any size.
By the way, every Zimaverse is different.
If a Zimaversal planet happens to have an Avantastructual civilization, they can be either just throwing rocks around or conquering almost an entire BIG Zimaverse.
The Actual Thing
[
]
The actual Zimaverse (the thing after the Avantastructual Avantaverse) is... a blank void? Quite lame. The edges of an actual Zimaverse seem to be completely black, not allowing ANYTHING to see out of it. It also seems indestructible, unles you are a Yindaversal civilization. The Avantastructural Avantaverses do not move, and it is cold... maybe too cold. Something weird happens if you try to stay in the parts of the Zimaverse without an Avantastructural Avantaverse (will be shortened to Asantaverse beyond this point), some weird things happen. Everything around you seems to disappear, and you start feeling you you're getting crushed by reality as if you were in a black hole. It feels... scary. And after that, you start hearing odd and creepy noises and-

So that means Bofaverses instantly teleports to other Avantaverses?
[

No, Bofaverses actully has a special type of matter, and that is Bofamatter, and the Avantaholes are also made out of Avantamatter. Bofamatter and Avantamatter repell eachother, so Bofaverses instantly gets thrown to the actual Avantaverse.

The Yindaverse is the 60th archverse. Its main structure are the aptly named Yindabubbles which are giant bubble-like objects that contain many Zimaverses. Yindaverses are usually filled up with Yindabubbles, leaving no space for anything to be not in a Yindabubble and also in the Yindaverse.
Yindabubbles
[
]
Yindabubbles are large bubble-like objects which take up the entirety of the Yindaverse. They contain many Zimaverses, as well as the occasional rogue Avantaverse. Its Avantaholes only lead to other rogue Avantaverses in the same Yindabubble, and if there are no other rogue Avantaverses in its Yindabubble, they do not work.
Frequently Asked Questions
[
]
Bubbles inside bubbles?
[
]
Yes, but very very VERY rarely. Unlike Yindabubbles directly inside the Yindaverse, which are crammed, which leaves no space, Yindabubbles inside other Yindabubbles are spaced out, as seen in the bottom image.
Are they poppable?
[
]
Yes. If you managed to squeeze a Yindabubble enough, or poked a hole in it, it would begin popping, which usually take upwards of 4 hours.
Are they poopable?
[
]
What?? No. They absorb poop.
Can bubbles merge?
[
]
They cannot. Testing to reveal if they can has resulted in many casualties.

1 - Shortest Yindaverse name, also the earliest Yindaverse ever to exist theoretically.
How may possible Yindaverse names are there?
[
]
To calculate this, we need to find the total amount of possible symbols which is 1,111,998, now, since there can be any ammount of name length (maximum at 10
100
, but the longer the names are, the rarer their names), we raise 1,111,998 to the maximum length possible, which is LITERALLY MORE THAN A GOOGOLPLEX! (more specifically, 10
10
100.7814756137158
, we will call this the total combinations for a Yindaverse Name) But, since there are more Yindaverses in a Xillaverse than the total combinations for a Yindaverse Name, there will be some Yindaverses with (n) after it where n is a positive integer. (e.g: YINda%yINgE8765$mlk";'(69420), also it cannot have a same number), the limit is an googolplex) The verse identifier 'Yinda' can also have many different capitalizations (e.g YINDa, YindA, yiNDa, etc), creating even more possibilities, around 10

A Xillaverse is the 61st archverse in the prefix-verse chain. There are many voids scattered arround in the Xillaverse, as the black stuff on the Xillaverse, shown on the infobox, are actually voids.
Xillavoids
[
]
After escaping a Yindaverse, you might think you landed on an empty void. But fear not, although you are correct, these voids aren't dangerous at all! They are actually the Yindaverse generators. The only reason why you land on a void is because Yindaverse dont go as fast. They travel only 10

Clusters
[
]
You haven't seen these in a long time, have you? Well, here it is! Clusters are rare structures with multiple -verses inside it! Clusters can be contained by a multicluster, hypercluster, omnicluster, etc..
There are 7 levels of clusters: Complex, Cluster, Compound, Plex, Join, Plock, Gamma. There can be such combinations, like Complexijoin, Gammaticompoundaplex, etc.  But there can be doubled names like Clustericluster, Gammatigamma, and Plexiplex. So there are other names, like complexicomplex to multicomplex, clustericluster to multicluster, multicompound, etc. The higher levels are like prefixed archverse and main hierarchy archverse first names like Xenoclusters, Petaplexes, and even Hypergammas.

Wholaverse Creatures
[

In wholaverse exist creatures, so meaning wholaverse can be dangerous. Most creatures appear in evil wholaverses, not appear in normal wholaverses.
Wholaman: A creature that taked over a evil wholaverse.
Wholagod: The god that taken over wholaverses, appears only in normal wholaverses. It friendly creature.
There many undiscovered creatures in wholaverses.
Wholaverse Formation and Destruction
[
]
Wholaverse Foramtion
[
]
Wholaverse forms from sky or water in vodaverse. Wholaverse also can be formed when 2 wholaverses collide. When wholaverse started form, layers also started to form, wholaverse matter is forming.
Wholaverse Destruction
[
]
Wholaverse have many ways how it can end it's lifetime.
Wholaverse Crunch - This happens when wholaverse reverses it's lifetime. Everything is reversing to before it's formation.
Wholaverse Rip - This happens when wholaverse lose it's last layers.
Wholaverse Collide - This happens when it collides with another wholaverse, resulting wholaverse rip for 2 wholaverses and forms another wholaverse.
Wholaverse Unform - This happens when layers, matter not forming. This is happening sometimes when wholaverses colliding.
Wholaverse Freeze - This happens when wholaverse got ejected from vodaverse. Wholaverse gets breaking.
Wholaverse Heat - This happens third wholaverse occurs in wholaverse collision. Wholaverse's layers get heated, matter get exploded.
Wholaverse Explosion - This happens when someone exploded wholaverse. Wholaverse breaks down.
Wholaverse Runaway - This happens when it's run out of xillaverses. Wholaverse get darker to black and then crunched to before it's formation.
Wholaverse Glitch - This happens when someone put inside wholaverse a
glitchonicite
. Wholaverse get corrupted and layers get more shaker than layer 1.
Want to live here?
[
]
Living in wholaverse is hard, matter may reach you and you burn down or freeze in ice. Inside layers exist shake, you may get died because of shake in layers. Living in evil wholaverse impossible, when you reached sea in vodaverse you will die.
Evil wholaverse
[
]
Evil wholaverse is wholaverse that is redder version of normal wholaverse, if you from normal wholaverse and survive tough vodaversal sea, you will die in evil wholaverse. Evil wholaverse contain a lot of creatures. There may exist sub-evil wholaverses, meaning part in vodaversal sea and other part is in vodaversal sky.

What is the Vodaverse?
[
]
The Vodaverse consists of 3 sections: the sea and the sky and the last one, the safezone
The Sea
[
]
The Sea is the deepest area and the border of Vodaverse. It is the most unsafe, as it has many unknown creatures that are potentially living hyperdimensional blackholes. So if you die on the seas of the Vodaverse, do not be surprised in heaven. It probably has 41% of the entire Wholaverse collections.
The Sky
[
]
The sky is the second most unsafe and also the second safest in the entire Vodaverse. It contains probably like 45% of the Wholaverses. Where is the rest of the 4%, you may ask? Well, it's in the...
The Safe Zone
[
]
This section is the safest of them all, and does not have any evil beings. So youre safe from duo in here.
There are no Evil Wholaverses in the safezone, only the good ones. Even though its pretty small, only covering 0.01% of the area of the Vodaverse, It has a thick bubble and needs a certain code to exit the safezone, and I won't tell you what it is. Yet. So that means the safe zone is very, very safe
Vodaverse's Border
[
]
The Vodaverse's Border is usually very thin, therefore, even the normal speed of light (299,792,458 meters per second) could pass through the border.
Why is it so thin, you may ask? It's because Wholaverses keep crashing to the borders and the Vodaverse will always try to fix the holes.

What is the Uteraverse?
[
]
The Uteraverse is designed to test something, the Vodaverses they contain are shrunken down by Uteramatter, to fit in machines that is wired togheter by Wholaverses. The machines are super dense and compact. The wiring can make it duplicate objects to replicate anything to test.
! WARNING !
Do not make it test something bigger than the testing zone as that will make it try to shrink it but it needs to hold the Vodaverses also shrinked, causing the Uteraverse to explode.
Uteramatter
[
]
Uteramatter is a type of matter that is very special. It always wants to be a specific temperature, and when treated with other temperatures, will change that particles temperature to the specific temperature (0° to be exact), and inside the testing zone the uteramatter will have a special state called shri-state, which will make the other stuff around it shrink.
Testing zone
[
]
The testing zone is a special zone where the testing is done. It is inside the Testing shell which is so strong that a
BLACK HOLE
cant even make a
dent
!
Circumference zone
[
]
The Circumference zone is a zone around its border (obviously) that has Vodaverses that is not shrunken down. The Uterawall holds it stable, to make it not able to be affected by the testing zone.
Escapable?
[
]
Almost impossible.
The border is being protected by THE wall, the wall is so strong it can resist anything, but you can glitch out, just that its not you that controls that you'll go outside of the Uteraverse, it is a 10
-100
% chance you will come your way through, but you can go closer and closer to the edge to maximize that chance, as the edge is far more glitchy than the middle of the Uteraverse. But still, your chance is minuscule. 10

to be exact.

Information on Post-Class
[
]
Feesh is reworking the Post-Class.
The
Jataverse, Inaverse, Homaverse, Gamaverse
and
Firaverse
have been
completed!
The
Emoaverse, Daxaverse
and
Charaverse
are
coming soon...
We need some color around here huh?
Gamaverse:
A verse with gigantic void that traps Gama-Particles, way more powerful than Ultrarradiant particles. These particles fly around in an infinite limbo. The Homaversal Grids live on the Void using Super-Gamarite Connectors, made of Super-Gamarite, a green, more powerful version of Gamarite, the material of the Homaverse. The Super-Gamarite is immune to voidal effects and is a magnet for Gama-Particles. The Gama-Void connects to all Gamaverses' Gamavoids. Some suspect the source of this power is extracting from the Yindaverse. Some think it's linked to the Source in the Wholaverse. This isn't too far fetched, as even the Fabric Dimension doesn't include the Gama-Void.
Firaverse:
FIRA THE HOLE!
-69fardhaha The Firaverse is a verse with countless variants and parts. They don't change like Olmaverses, but each one is different, with many properties that can make them unique. Most don't rotate like a Motaverse, except for some that do, but they all move around. They're very sparse, and constantly in war, trying to assimilate their properties. If successful, they take over the core and merge their being to make a Compound Firaverse. One kind of Firaverse, the White Firaverse Army hates this. They destroy Compound Firaverses that were previously imprisoned, and recruit them. Over a very, very, very long time, the WFA are winning.
Emoaverse:
The Firaverses fly around in the white part of the Emoa-Verse, which is a void. In the yellow parts, it's the opposite of a void, and Firavoids fly around, which are the absence of matter. The yellow matter is extremely strong, yet "fluid" and easily pushed apart by the presence of void, which allows Firavoids to fly around, not propelled by anything. A Firaverse and a Firavoid, if collided, will basically explode. The White and Orange parts are in constant war, with the White part pushing the Orange part and the Orange part trying to stay rigid in spite of the white part. If a Firaverse of Firavoid tries to cross the border it dies, and the walls are made of both which allow neither to cross. Each scenario also has a catastrophic ending. If Void wins it compressed the Orange matter into a point, and with nothing holding it apart, the whole Emoaverse turns into a black hole. If Orange wins, there is too much mass and the Emoaverse also collapses. Unfortunately, the Emoaverse is not stable, and will eventually fall into one of the catastrophes. Emoaverses die before the Firaverses. However, the Firaverses need the environment of the Emoaverse so its not like rogue Firaverses would live longer, unlike rogue Grinaverses... It also has a "Crisis Mode". Even though most Firaverses die, some may live, so it ejects everything and hopes some Firaverses live by being scooped up by other Emoaverses. This is what happened to Gaq'othr.
Daxaverse:
Dont worry Ill come up with something daxaverse bop bop yes yes yes
Charaverse:
There is some lore in the Bofaverse, so the Charaverse is like a grid of "crystals of reality" uhh idk man bye bye 🤫🧏
Information on new verses
[
]
Avantaverse:
A gigantic "living" verse with pylons, holes and it generated bofaverses and there's some sort of The Bread-like thing in the core.
Zimaverse:
A colony of Avantaverses that makes up BIG multicellular life, that lives on BIG planets, that make up BIG galaxies, so on and so forth!
Yindaverse:
It's a gigantic void surrounded by a "Bubble" of sorts. This bubble is, surprisingly, passable, but if you try and destroy it, it has huge consequences. See, everything inside is connected by the Fabric, an infinite-dimensional fabric that ties together reality, made of strings and folds and bends through all the dimensions to create the contours of spacetime. It's the reason any of our teleportation works, and even solves the secret of the Audaverse, Ochaverse, Yuraverse, Jameaverse... All of these are just cleverly bent onto themselves using the Fabric, and hidden in the Fabricspace, which is the dimension where space is infinitely contracted and all the Fabric lives, hidden. If the bubble pops, the fabric rushes out of the bubble like pressurised air in space. It dissipates and everyone DIES. (note by Universe2011, original creator of Yindaverse, it is a verse that contains bubble-like structures known as Yindabubbles that contain Zimaverses. When they pop, everything in it stops existing, basically killing everything inside. It is actually completely filled with Yindabubbles, so much so, that there is no empty space inbetween the Yindabubbles. I'm not even sure a Protoverse could fit!)
Xillaverse:
It's another void. There's a lot of these Yindaverses, and in the middle of the Xillaverse there's The Weaver. It collects floating microstrings from the subspace and weaves them into reality fabric. Weaving all this fabric takes a while, and so it takes nanillions of years to weave a Yindaverse. If a Yindaverse wanders too far, it may become distorted and pop, so the Weaver creates a sort of "leash" made of extremely tightly packed Fabric that surrounds the Yindaverse and latches onto the fabric. If a Yindaverse pops, this fabric may sever, which creates an enormous explosion.
Wholaverese:
A sort of "Box". It's a sentient verse that carries a Source of infinite energy, as well as countless Xillaverses of all varieties, not just our own kind. It's finite, but much larger on the inside than expected, and the verse is very "varied", with many materials. The Wholaverse, however, contains a Corruption, which attempts to corrupt the Wholaverse, which is the fate of many Evil Wholaverses in the Vodaverse. If it's corrupted, the Source fails, all the matter is rearranged to become uninhabitable, and it gets dragged down by the Vodaversal Sea. It floats and looks for an exit, but as it turns out, there is none. It just loops on and on forever. Unless you look down...
Vodaverse:
The Vodaverse is seperated into a "sky" of sorts and a "sea" or sorts, which IS NOT WATER, which is dangerous even to exist in. The sea has multiple levels as well, getting more evil the further down you go. If you try and go anywhere but down, it just loops over, and you cannot escape. The bottom contains a sinkhole to lead to a final bossfight (I'm serious). The Vodaverse has many trials. On the Surface, you'll find Evil Wholaverses and the "water" tries to kill you. In the next level, you'll find minerals that are both valuable and dangerous. The water becomes a maze with obstacles everywhere. Here you'll find The Corruption, an Evil Wholaverse that absorbs other Wholaverses to become a huge, extremely deadly verse. It makes the "water" around it even deadlier than before. The next level, it's all corrupted, and you must pass through it to get further. In this zone, it's much more dangerous as you are right next to the Corruption, and the Xillaverses are extremely dangerous. The final level does not allow the Corruption in. It doesn't allow any kind of light, it glitches it out. Here, you'll find the Abyss, a place where the True Corruption controls all time and space, and you need to actively fight the True Corruption, lest you be trapped forever. The sinkhole at the bottom leads to escaping the Vodaverse.
Uteraverse:
A huge machine designed to "test" something. It contains many of these Vodaverses, shrunk to fit in a machine that measure every aspect. To maintain this, supercomputers and generators of insane power are used. Wiring goes everywhere. Upon finally exiting the challenge, we see manuals and instructions allo over the place. We recognise these symbols because this is OUR language. Did
we
make this machine??? There's a button here that says "Press This". Should we press it?
Trillaverse:
A verse with a chaotic cloud core.
Sovaverse:
A grid of sectors. Each one is very abruptly divided, with wildly different terrain. There is no physical border between them, and they periodically change.
Ronaverse:
The Sovaverses are enclosed by a huge Box-like structure. It contains Fractal Bubbles, Fractal Frames, and so on. Each Box has a different structure and is seperated from the others with a massive wall.
Qazaverse:
The final verse in Extended Divergent Archverses. But is it the final one? No, not just yet... The Qazaverse contains many rare devices, minerals and materials, including stuff like the Фак ю, which filters anything for anything. This is great for scanning objects for life... before you obliterate them. In the center of the Qazaverse, the large light, you see a room. A room with... a HDMI port??? The sign morphs into your language, and says: "Tell us your story, and we will tell you ours." Upon uploading the EDA catalog into the receptacle, the room expands with wallscovered in inscriptions from different civilisations. It includes an introduction to the Qazaverse, a warning about the future ones, a wish of good luck, and the adventures of many other civilisations, all of which evolved from different Universes, Multiverses, etc... Archverse lore???

"FEESH WHAT THE ACTUAL F#%$K HAVE YOU DONE"
-
Tongfangnoi1
The Bofaverse takes the form or two conjoined hyperspheres, which are filled to the brim with a thick liquid named Charafluid. The Bofaverse is home to a perculiar, roughly Universe-sized beings called Bophades that live on the surface of the Bofaverse. They communicate in a low-pitched language that took a while for Feesh to decipher.
The Bophades
[
]
The Bophades have a unique culture that is very focused on food. Their main ingredient in all their dishes is a collection of red and blue pebbles nicknamed "Bophades Nuts" by the Feesh, due to their small size and nutty aroma. They have unique flavours that change as you chew them, and can sometimes even grant temporary hallucinations, euphoria or even sudden wisdom and clarity. Interestingly, if one type is eaten without the other, it can cause severe pain and sometimes even instant death. It is possible to grind the nuts to mitigate this, but the Bophades claim that the nuts have a unique taste that is muted if you grind them up.
Inside the Bofaverse
[
]
Inside the Bofaverse, the two hyperspheres are conjoined by a small tube. The walls of the Bofaverse are incredibly hard to break and get harder the deeper you drill.
Inside each of the hyperspheres, all the Charaverses are suspended in a thick, opaque fluid. At the intersection, there exists a Portable Reality Engine. It's a Reality Engine similar to the Avantaverse's giant Reality Engine, used for inhabiting deep space. We like in the L Sphere, but in the R sphere, all the Charaverses and their crystals are flipped, meaning that everything is opposite. Now, if you flip Charaverse, you still get Charaverse. But the same is not true inside. When you enter said Crystals, you actually start inside the tiniest finite thing - the outside of an inverted subatomic particle, like a quark. Trying to escape will just lead to nothing. But, if you shrink yourself, you will enter an inside-out Inuverse. Every law of physics is inverted and every characteristic about every verse inside the R sphere is 100% opposite.
Inside the Inuverse, which is a flipped Universe, everything is opposite and it's contained by a quark and contains many Miltuverses. The Miltuverses are 100% opposite, but they're quite generic. They contain a Mageverse. As you shrink and shrink, you reach more verses, like an Echaverse becomes an Acheverse. It contains a Dranuverse and is contained by a Frameverse. It's an unordered collection of uniform solid Dranuverses with random shapes. Or a Veptaverse is now a Vapteverse. It contains an Achuverse and is contained by a Waxeverse. It's a stagnant lattice of Achuverses. Etc, etc. Once you shrink to 10
-2
55.60
ly, inside a Daxeverse, you exit the crystal in the R sphere.
Formation of the Bofaverse
[
]
The Bofaverse formation is brutal. The Avantaverse is full of holes, and inside these holes, Bofaverses form. The hyperspheres have two kinds: R and L. L Spheres are created near the outside, while R Spheres are created at the other end. They are attracted to each other, and they must find a pairing before they violently explode and are reabsorbed by the Avantaverse. In this race for survival, most "Spheres" die. But for the lucky Bofaverses that do survive this process, they exit the Avantaverse Hole to venture out into the deep space. Over their lifetime, as Charaverses die, they will shrivel up, and shrink until the Bofaverse is no more, releasing its energy into the cosmos.
Overall, our Bofaverse is an incredibly interesting verse. The nuts are said to be one of the best foods in the whole Avantaverse, so, if you'd like to taste something out of this world, try Bophades nuts.
