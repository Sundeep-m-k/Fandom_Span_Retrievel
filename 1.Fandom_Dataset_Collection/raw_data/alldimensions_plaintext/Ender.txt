The Ender is a layers full of people that commited crimes. Laws use this so people are tortured inside the Ender. Even if you die in the Ender, you will come back alive. You are given no food and no cover. There is nothing that can make you happy here, your happyines will keep going down, so everyone is sad, they dont wanna do anything anymore... They would want to feel pain for the rest of their life then being here.
Layers
[

These are the layers, and they are like prison cells. People who commit worse crimes then other will be put one layer down, and every layer get more horrible the further down you go.
Layer 1
[
]
Layer 1 is where you dont get hit, or hurted. You can walk around infinitely and talk to other inmates. So its not bad, because you can get out a month later. This is where if people have hit, or hurted others, they will be put in this layer.
Layer 2
[
]
Layer 2 is where it start to become prison-like. Because you are in a contained cell, and get beaten up by guards if you dont obey what they say. You have to work or you will be beaten up. You have to wake up at certain times or you will be put further down layers.
Layer 3
[
]
Layer 3 is the worst. You will be given no food, and have to kill animals by yourself. You will always get more sadder and sadder, even if you have fun, that will go away quickly. You will always be beaten up by the guards even if you behave. You will be choked by machines and if you miss anything at Layer 3, you will get ripped by the guards wolfs.
Layer 4
[
]
This is the last layer. There is nothing you can do here, and everyone is far away so they dont talk. You will be given no food, and there are even no animals. You will forever get hungryer and hungryer. There is nothing else. You will always feel pain in Layer 4.
