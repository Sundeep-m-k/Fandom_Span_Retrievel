Contained by:
The Great Triangle
Contains:
contents of a normal Universe, such as
galaxies
The Leakverse is a huge verse in the
The Great Triangle
constantly leaking out its contents
.
The Leakverse is one of the densest verses in the entire Great Triangle, so much that even a
Stealbot
has a relatively hard time pulling it. Stars can be as close as 300 miles to each other, with there being no big voids.
The Leakverse's contents usually
float into interversal space until a verse absorbs it
.
Coververses
have grown very big from absorbing the Leakverse's contents, and might even pose a threat to the Leakverse itself if they aren't taken care of.
The Leakverse first started out as a regular large verse until
fragments from a verse exploding punctured countless holes in the Leakverse's barrier
, making many of its contents spill out. So far, the Leakverse has lost approximately 7% of its contents, losing about 0.001% of its contents every
OYC
. If the Leakverse's leaking rate stays the same, the Leakverse will become a void in about 100,000 OYC.
The Leakverse is
a great source of material/energy, as stars, planets, entire galaxies, and even black holes leak from the verse
. Many civilizations have moved their verses all the way outside
The Box
just to go to the Leakverse and collect its abundance of materials. Other civilizations have traveled here
to patch up the holes
, which proved to be very difficult due to the size of the Leakverse and the sheer number of holes.
