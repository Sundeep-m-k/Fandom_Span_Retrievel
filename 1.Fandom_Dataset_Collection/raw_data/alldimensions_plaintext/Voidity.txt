Voidity
is a measure of how
void
-like an verse is based on it's density and number of inhabitants, and also the chance that deleted wormhole ports will enter to the verse. The Voidity of an object can range from 0 to 1, with 0 being the densest object known (
THE atom
) and 1 being the emptiest object known (the core of
Leagers
). It ignores
dark matter
,
Glitchonicite
and any other compounds that have not been thoroughly studied.
