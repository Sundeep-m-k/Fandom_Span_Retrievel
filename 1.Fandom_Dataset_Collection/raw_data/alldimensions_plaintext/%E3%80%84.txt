Gravity and Magnets
[
]
While these verses are very large, they're quite similar to
Earth
in the gravity and the magnetic pull properties. The diagram on the right (infobox) shows the forces, which create a magnetic pull and therefore gravity is also made.
Purpose
[
]
They usually are used a lot for industrial and productive purposes, and they do this through the materials of their local Boxbox. There are many
materials
in the latters which can be converted to nearly anything else using their 〄s.
