The Lord of Goodness
You are beautiful—inside and out. Your existence is special, and the world is a better place because you’re in it. Life isn’t always fair, and sometimes it can be unbelievably tough. There will be days when everything feels heavy, when the road ahead seems impossible, and when you wonder if it’s even worth it. But listen to me—never give up. Ever. Because your dreams, your happiness, and your future are worth fighting for.No matter how hard things get, keep going. The struggles you face don’t define you; what defines you is how you rise after falling. Every great story has challenges, every hero faces hardships, and every dreamer encounters doubt. But the ones who keep pushing forward, even when everything seems stacked against them—those are the ones who make their dreams come true. And you can too.The world is beautiful, even when it doesn’t seem like it. There is light, even in the darkest places. And you, just by being here, add to that beauty. Your existence matters. You matter. There’s so much ahead of you—so many moments of joy, love, and triumph waiting to unfold. Don’t let a rough chapter make you forget that your story is far from over.Believe in yourself. Trust that you are capable of amazing things. And when life knocks you down, stand back up, stronger than before. Keep chasing your dreams, keep pushing forward, and never stop believing that happiness is possible. Because it is. And you deserve it.
