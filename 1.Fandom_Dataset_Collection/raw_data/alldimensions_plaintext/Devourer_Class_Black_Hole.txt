A
Devourer Class Black Hole
is a type of
black hole
that exists in
Structures Of Everything
, being covered in space-time and capable of devouring the space-time of
universes
.
This type of black hole first starts attaching into an universe. Then, its outer layer of space-time is merged with them, pulling all of their space-time into it. Finally, the entire space-time of that universe becomes part of the Black Hole. If conditions are right, an universe can exist at its edge. Or if the black hole reaches the right side, the universe's contents can exist at the black hole's edge.
The (Not) Largest Black Hole Type In Entire All Dimensions
[

This is not the largest black hole type. But, there might have been black hole-based entities here in the cosmology. But not even this, the universe, this and "
Nosphere
" (opposite of Allsphere) might have been true nothingness instead of black hole-like properties.
