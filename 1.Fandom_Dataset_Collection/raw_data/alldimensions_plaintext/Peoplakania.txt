is a cluster of up to [489,489,489]
Trioctoprverses
with dark energy packed between them sparsely. Due to the dark energy, the Trioctoprverses inside of it are falling apart increasingly fast It is more unstable than any texa, ring, or kentoverse, ejecting up to 489E489 kentoverses per yoctosecond. It is also extremely hot, due to mass heat transfer from the
The tistden
. Due to its unstability, dark matter, and its extreme heat, not a single entity lives outside of the Trioctoprverses. However, it has been reported that up to 2E1 superheated rogue planets exist between the Trioctoprverses, which are also being separated from each other due to dark energy.
