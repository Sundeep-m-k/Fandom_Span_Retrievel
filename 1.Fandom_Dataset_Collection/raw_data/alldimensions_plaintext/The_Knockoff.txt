The Knockoff is a massive verse with the intention to generate verses which replicate other verses almost perfectly (although the clones are far lesser for more complex things like
Thegatus
) and perplex other many individuals. The Knockoff is still being used to this day, and has been used to replicate other verses, and entities.
Formation
[
]
(note:The Knockoff was created by
The Ripoff
)
The Knockoff was originally constructed in 7092 OYC, when cosmos raiders in Confinement threatened to annihilate the inside verses. The Knockoff was constructed to almost imitate other verses to perplex the raiders, thus causing discourse amidst themselves.
Although, after the peril of cosmos raiders was absent, The Knockoff was used for way more malevolent objectives, such as constructing counterfeit verses that seem similar to another thing but really lead into an unending vacuum.

Copying
Thegatus
[
]
Originally,
The Ripoff
was used to copy
Thegatus
, however, after
Organismverse
and
Arthorpida
were created, the gods realized that cloning
Thegatus
would take too long in The Ripoff and used The Knockoff to mass produce lesser clones, creating many things like
The Facility
. Then this would be such part of both
The Ripoff
, and
The Knockoff
to have this much range as it is for including the copying stuff.
