This is a type of verse that is shaped like a
Möbius strip
, it does this because the physics in the -verses they're contained within, some kinds of entropy are based on objects having low amounts of sides.

Structure and coloring
[
]
Möbiverses have a structure where they contain large amounts of other Möbiverses, and the color of any specific Möbiverse comes from the distance between the Möbiverses inside it, because of how light particles interact with Möbiverses. However, when the distance between two Möbiverses becomes greater than about 0.5mm (0.01 in), all visual light particles can go through the gaps and you can see the colors of the Möbiverses inside it.
Lone Möbiverses
[
]
At some point, the structure of Möbiverses ends and we have a Möbiverse of a specific size. These are called
lone Möbiverses
, and they fly through space until they interact with another Möbiverse. The currently largest known Möbiverse (MO-89) has a length of around 1270 miles (2040 kilometers), although its height and width are unknown. It was the 89th Möbiverse to be discovered, hence the name. The estimated upper limit of the size of Möbiverses is likely around 2000 miles.
Formation
[
]
Higher structure Möbiverses are formed by a group of close Möbiverses of similar size being attracted by gravitational pull. Because of the second entropy, also known as one-sided entropy, makes its shape similar to the strip. Larger Möbiverses are created from other Möbiverses colliding with the larger one. If the Möbiverse is smaller, it will just join the rest of the Möbiverses that make up it. If it's large enough, it could break and all of the Möbiverses inside it would go into the largest one.

This Möbiverse is white because it has it's Möbiverses very close together.
