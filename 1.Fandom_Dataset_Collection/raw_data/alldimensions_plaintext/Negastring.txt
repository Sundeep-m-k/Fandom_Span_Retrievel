Negastrings
are strings but for negative objects. everything in the
versuni
chain
consists of it.
they are also an exact copy of ordinary
strings
, therefore....
A string is the fundamental building block of universes and everything else, they are on such a small scale, called the  nega Planck scale. This means they measure a nega Planck Length like the nega quantum foam. It cannot be ripped apart. Although it is - absolute infinity dimensional, it affects other dimensions. It is loop-shaped and unites the laws of the large and the laws of the small.
Supposedly,
strings
vibrate in different ways, each for different types of matter, meaning there are many different types of
strings
.
Anything smaller than a string would have lengths so small that they might have lengths that wouldn't make sense in reality. The only way to circumnavigate this is to have Microdimensions.
In our cosmology, matter and Antimatter are merged in the quantum scale by
strings
, although matter made of this object is
neutral matter
.
