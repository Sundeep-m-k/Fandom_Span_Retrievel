Why are RE‘s in this verse.
[
]
First of all, This verse is NOT physical, its part of the
Xenoverse
, A 4D Virtual Reality, which means it connected to a Inter-verse network, and is a common place where different types of species put RE memes into this website. The Xenoverse is HUGE, but still very full, so many, MANY RE memes yet somehow end up here, and a species named The
Reemans
, are responsible for taking the memes to other users across the site.
Why Reverse was made in the first place.
[
]
Being inside a Inter-Verse web, a lot of memes have to be sorted for the users to browse through. I dont know the exact reason, but a person named,
REESs
, made the site mostly for memes, (and money), and hoping to make a big profit out of it. The Reemans were a species of REESs and taken into the web to work for this site.
Is there transport between verses and Reverse?
[
]
Yes, But REESs is the only one that can move between his verse (
Maoid/Maverse
), and the Reverse.
Is this a smart site?
[
]
no its not, at least in my eyes.
Reverse
A site.
Label
A Inter-Verse site.
Label
A Computer Network device used to make memes on the Inter-verse web.
