Liminality
is a scale that uses the unit
l/L
similar to d/D for
Dimensionality
. It tracks a different type of coordinate in space, one that determines the depth of lims (limspaces) between space. For example,
1-L
or 1-liminal refers to lims with barely any content and are mostly voids between different spaces.
1-Liminal

1-Liminal spaces are a mostly flat space existing between other spaces. Life forms are only 1-liminal.
2-Liminal
[
]
2-Liminal spaces have a fixed end and beginning. It lacks depth, and exists between spaces. Life forms are 2-liminal.
3-Liminal

3-Liminal spaces have depth, and are located between two spaces. The life forms are 3-liminal.
