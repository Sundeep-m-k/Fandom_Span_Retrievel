The Loopverse 2 is one of the amazing loopverses which contain themselves an infinite amount of times. For this to work, they are both exactly the same size and contain themselves always at all times, so they have to be the exact same size and the exact same position. These verses are not even a planck length off, it is actually perfect. Perfection is one-of-a-kind in these verses, which is what makes them special.
