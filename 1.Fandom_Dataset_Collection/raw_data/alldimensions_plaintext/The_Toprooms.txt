The Toprooms
consists of a three-dimensional dimension located in the
Aquarius Universal Supercluster
, also known as "The Top Of
The Backrooms
".
The Toprooms
is formed by several flat structures formed by corridors and rooms (where they are born naturally without any intervention). All these structures are orbiting and navigating through the space of The Toprooms, without the existence of galaxies, star systems, natural satellites and other common objects.

The Toprooms is a very recently created dimension in relation to other dimensions or universes, having its creation approximately 50 million years ago. This shows that the time here is relatively fast. One of the best known "planets" or tenalps of The Toprooms is Htrae, where it is in The Great Orbit of the Seven, it contains habitable life that lasts from approximately 1 million years ago, its technology is advancing extremely fast but it is still outdated.

The origin of The Toprooms is being studied by its inhabitants, but according to advanced research from abroad, its creation may have been caused by the first connection of planet

with The Backrooms, where an unusual out of control was actually caused by a large earthquake. magnitude, if the existence of other earthquake magnitude levels were listed, would be magnitude

, this could still explain the nonlinearities and collapse of The Backrooms' existence. With this opening to The Backrooms, the pieces of
The Frontrooms
and The Backrooms giving life to The Toprooms, the way in which the dimensions were ripped apart is still inexplicable.
