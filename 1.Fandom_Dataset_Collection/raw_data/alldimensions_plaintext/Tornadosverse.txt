The
Tornadosverse
is a small verse that has an abundance of tornadoes and stormy weather. It is possible to colonize and live in.
All the tornadoes have a chemical named GR847 and it works like magnetism, as its power can be harnessed and used for stuff like transmission or a way to move things. However, in order to not have every thing basically blow up, there are special rooms for lightning rods to keep the lightning away from critical things.
Water is also extractable from the tornados in this verse, with it being a common job in the Tornadosverse.
