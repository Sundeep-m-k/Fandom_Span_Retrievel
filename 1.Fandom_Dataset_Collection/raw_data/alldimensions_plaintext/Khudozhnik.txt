Khudozhnik
(Meaning: Painter) is an omni-dimensional entity that interloops every fictional plane of existence, instantly devouring everything and reconstructing the works of art into low-budget dung. He is the main enemy of good art.
Design
[
]
Khudozhnik's design is that of a lifeless uninspired mess of random colours and black lines that spreads infinitely across the screen. From a certain prespective, it may be compared to that of Lovecraftian monsters, but the similarities far in between. It is a perversion of originality - an ugly twist. It's goal is to turn any wholesome work of art into something devoid of good qualities, leaving only inane cliched stories and uninspiring pictures.
Power
[
]
Almost unstoppable. Biased favoritism is the only thing capable of halting this monster's approach.
