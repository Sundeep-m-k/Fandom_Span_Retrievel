The Nullverse, or ∅verse for short, is a type of -verse with an existence rank of ∅, meaning that it is a Schrödinger's cat of a -verse, except that instead of it being alive and dead at the same time, it is existing and non-existing at the same time. Therefore it has a simultaneous existence rank of 0 and 1, which, to simplify it, is existence rank ø.
Matter is called Nullmatter in the Nullverse and any -verse with an existence rank of ∅, and the elements in this -verse are prefixed with Null-. Additionally, mass of objects with existence rank ∅ are halved to account for the existence and non-existence of such matter to those with existence rank 1.
For example, gallium-69 has an atomic mass of 69.723, but nullgallium-69 has an atomic mass of 34.8615. Individual nullparticles (particles with existence rank ∅) also get their atomic mass halved. Similarly, nullorganisms - or more accurately, organisms with existence rank ∅, also have half of the mass of a normal organism, or more accurately, organisms with existence rank 1.
