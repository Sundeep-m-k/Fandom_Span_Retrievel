Kiloverse
is a surprisingly dense (relative to other verses) and extremely large cluster containing trillions of ‘kilostars’, usually hot and luminous stars such as young O or B-type stars, (but not really). These stars behave exactly like O or B-type stars in our universe, but they are shaped as an 5D hyperspheres rather than a 3D sphere like our universe's stars. Unlike in our Universe, their size doesn’t make them short-lived, and they can live for ridiculously long times due to their structure.
Due to the Kiloverse’s density, collisions happen often. However, kilostars can only really be a fixed size. If two collide, they may form a kiloblack hole, or just explode into dust. This creates alot of light. This is another reason why the Kiloverse is so bright, yet the stars can live so long.
Although unlikely, it is possible for planets to form around these stars and extremophile life can form on these planets. The stars are of such a bright blue type that most Kiloverses appear like light, radiant blue rather than black.
Kiloverses are made of up to a few trillion stars that are mostly massive main sequence-stars. There are also smaller populations of intermediate-mass stars and giant stars, but these are generally more rare and only make up around 6-20% of the stars in a Kiloverse depending on the type. Kiloverses have an approximately spherical distribution of stars with more near the center. The innermost layers of a Kiloverse are very chaotic and have practically no life in it because there are so many stars that are only a few AUs apart from each other. Stellar collisions are very common in these areas, which cause multiple stars to dissolve into dust to reform again.
Size
[
]
Kiloverses may be classified by their size and abundance of non-O/B-type stars. They use size classes from 0 to 5 and the abundance classes from 0 to 3. For example, our Kiloverse is type 4-2, meaning it is larger than average and is relatively abundant in non-O/B type stars. The majority of observed kiloverses seem to be small and have a low abundance of non-O/B-type stars, so our Kiloverse is anomalous in this regard. Size class 0 kiloverses are only about 298 quadrillion ly in size, whereas size class 5 ones are about 43 quintillion ly in size.
