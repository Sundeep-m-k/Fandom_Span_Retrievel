Versemergical Itchiness is a spread of a substance that has a chance of happening when two verses with different laws of physics collide. The substance is not affected by gravity but it can easily float through space, and when it touches a hard object, it will add some of its substance to it, creating a reaction between the substance and the object which can damage the object or slow it down from moving or operating. It was named the Versemergical Itchiness because it feels like itchiness to living things, which it can also touch.

Removing Versemergical Itchiness
How it appears
[
]
Different physics, when collided, are very unstable, so they can't possibly connect to each other without destroying reality. Instead, when different physics collide, an invisible substance forms where the physics did collide. Usually, this substance has no properties and don't even seem to exist. However, if the physics have at least 3 properties that are polar opposite of each other, the substance will turn into Versemergical Itchiness. This is because the high amount of cancelled properties add more properties to this substance.
Effects on objects

When Versemergical Itchiness touches an object, the object, if it uses a force to operate, will stop working. This is because the Versemergical Itchiness will make the object have "less friction" in air, making it move slower because the substance will leave an invisible "mark" on the object which will spread over to the rest of the object, making the object "aware" of it. It is possible to remove this substance from the object if you know where it is, but the substance will simply use its effects on the object used to remove it.
Effects on living things

When Versemergical Itchiness touches a living thing, it will have the same effects as on an object, but the living thing will feel it. It feels a lot like an itch, but touching that Versemergical Itchiness will put it on the other object too, so if you scratch it, it will move to your finger.
Removing Versemergical Itchiness

The best way to remove a Versemergical Itchiness is by using an object to remove it and putting it in a vacuum, since that means it won't spread from the object.
