Heavens
are
verses
that, despite what their name may indicate, are NOT the biblical ones nor the ones from other religions (like the Western Heaven by the Buddha, Eastern Heaven by Allah, Northern Heaven by the Christian God, Southern Heaven by the Judaist god, etc.), which we all know about, though the former's purpose is similar to it.
These are, instead, made by
normal
beyond godities
in order to both contain
omni gardens
in safe places and send the souls of deceased good
entities
of our
Wikiverse
, though they cannot be stronger than the Heavens themselves in order for these to keep their stability. Omni gardens mostly work as cores for them.
The skies of Heavens also contain many invisible
Timelineverses
, in which the good souls of each timeline fall down from their local one and get manually pulled into their local Heaven by the beyond godities.
They, ironically, are contained by
Hells
, which basically are their polar opposites. Beyond godities obviously try to protect the Heavens from any specially strong soul found in their local Hell.
Consumption
[
]
Heavens usually need to eat 1 axiom every
f
OYC
in order to keep properly working. If the situation is really dire, one beyond godity may be needed to replace said axiom for the heaven to keep on working.
Supermassive Heavens
[
]
Heavens that require MORE than one axiom / normal beyond godity in the same interval of time to keep their stability are known as "supermassive Heavens". These can sometimes even contain normal Heavens.
Local destruction
[
]
A long time ago,
Godzilla in Hell
actually managed to destroy our Heaven and nearly got our local omni garden too, though he luckily got beaten by
THE TRUE CREATOR
before said thing happened. The latter soon recreated our Heaven, returning things back to normal.

Sub-Alphasm clouds
[
]
They're, like their name indicates, clouds where all living all nice sub-
Alphasm
level entities go when they die.
Pre-class
entities, known and unknown
gods
, etc. live here.
Post-Alphasm disks
[
]
Similar as the formerly mentioned section, but for
post-Alphasm level
entities
. These sections are the main reason axioms have to be eaten by Heavens to keep working, since maintaining such entities is a hard task.
