A drawing of the two cats together.
Mysterious feline. Eats the cat food and mice it can find, and disappears out of sight before sight can even happen, leaving behind a box with its signature pattern decorated onto it. White with colorful dots. You don't know what you'll find in each box. You may want to, you may not. Classified documents on it have mysteriously gone missing without a trace.
Something may be taking these documents.
don't cross the line with me
The
Gift Cat
is a mysterious entity that gives gifts to entities in the 1st
Realm
. She is the sister of the
Void Cat
and likes to eat cat food and mice. If an entity places out some cat food or a mouse for the Gift Cat, she may happily eat it and may also bring a gift. If any given entity attempts to observe the Gift Cat eating, she will teleport away along with the food and a gift may appear.
She has only been sighted 3 times, and looks like a white cat with colored dots on her fur and rainbow ears. Her favorite flavor of cat food seems to be original Twix flavor. She resides in
The Cathouse
when not bringing gifts, a place created by her brother to keep her safe while sleeping. (don't make the cathouse i'm gonna make it not you)

The Gifts
[
]
The gifts are in white rectangular prism boxes with colorful dots on them. Inside the boxes you can find many things, however there is usually only one item in each box. These items range from toys to premium cat food to even
Primordium Delta
. A few notable items have been an infinite candy bar, a strange book, and a photo.
There are many more gifts however we can only list so many. Gift Cat seems to be happy when other entities are happy. This has led to Gift Cat giving gifts to other entities to make them happy.
Candy Bar
[
]
One of the gifts that Gift Cat gave was a candy bar that seems to be white chocolate with rainbow specks. This candy bar when consumed will be tastier than anything the consumer has tasted, and will also regenerate. The candy bar is currently being studied to see what kind of material it is. The wrapper says "A GIFT" on it.

Another gift that was given by Gift Cat was a photo. Not just any photo however. When entities were researching The Supremeum of Zero, they were trying to find a way to take a picture of it. When they looked behind them, they saw a gift and went to research it. They found a photo inside of it. The photo was of The Supremeum of Zero with the caption "Zero." This has since been proven to be what it actually looks like.
Cat Food
[

Another one of the gifts was a bag of cat food. Like the candy bar, its bag has the words "A GIFT" on it, and the actual food is colored using colors from the rainbow. It has been shown to be able to satisfy almost all cats in the 1st
Realm
, and even dogs. The material has recently been discovered but hasn't been named yet. We've been able to replicate the material.
Interexistium
[
]
Another notable example of the gifts is a material that can bond with objects of any
Existence Rank
and make it able to interact with other objects of any Existence Rank while retaining all other properties. The box also contained a note describing the substance's property. It has been used to pass different structures such as the
Omniverse
and
The Box
, and used to communicate between existence ranks. When the box was opened, the Interexistium split between two objects which were existence-4 and 5 due to the attraction of the two existence ranks.
Book of Sight
[
]
The book of sight was a book that was one of the most notable and strange gifts the Gift Cat has gave. It appears to be a blank book at first, but if you write the name of an object into it, it will show you a picture of the object. It has infinite pages and when turned to another page, the page written on will clear back to a blank one.
If you try to use the book to view the Gift Cat, Void Cat, or any verse that cannot be viewed, it will use a symbol that resembles cat whiskers as a placeholder. This symbol when seen in the book will be forgotten instantly after being seen. This is maybe the Void Cat's contribution to the gift due to the symbol's property of being easily forgotten.
