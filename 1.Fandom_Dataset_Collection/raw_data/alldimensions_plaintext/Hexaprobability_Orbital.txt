This particular verse relies on the principle of electron orbitals, but it's very different. The inferior verses are basically contained according to a probability spectrum. The Hexaprobability Orbital is a probability spectrum. It means it uses probability regions to determine where a particular verse will be. The more lighter regions indicate that there is a higher probability of a inferior verse that exists. However, the farther you go towards the darker regions, it will keep converging torwards 0 as a a non-zero probability for infinity. This means: P > 0, where P means probability.
The super bright regions indicate a

probability of finding any verse under the existance rank of Hexaprobability orbital. But it does not surpass the existence rank of
The Magma Realm
, while the voids between the colours of the image indicates (the black regions) that the probability is close to 0. The verses contained in this thing behave like electrons flying in a probability region. It also suprisingly has many shapes and forms, not just this image with the infobox, because its shape is fluid. It changes shapes, meaning the orbital would look differently depending on how you're "observing" it.
Note: This verse relies on mathemathical models to explain
To enter this universe, individuals need to go through the
Transillud Omnistructure
by exiting out of it. However, traveling to a lower verse of the Hexaprobability orbital is very easy, by just picking a
lower
verse and get out of there. There is a catch, since things change around mysteriously and the verse is highly unpredictable. However, the likelihood of getting into the inferior verses, such as the omniverse and so on, has a
very
high probability at the brighter regions but a lower probability on the outskirts. The probability of finding superior verses will be higher at the darker regions, but they rely on a quality > quantity principle. So as you approach the darkness, you approach more superior verses at a low quantity. The most superior verse this contains is

Explaining the unknown
[
]
The observer wouldn't be able to focus on a singular verse without losing visual accuracy of your enviroment. This is called the
Nesy-Uncertainty-Principle
and it is similar to Heisenberg's idea, but it's used for a different purposes. It doesn't apply to only verses but also affects what literal dimensions you'd see. Refer to the
Nesy-Uncertainty-Principle
please. refer to the same page.

tart from E1 and make your way to E2. Remember, follow the order:  "AV-1 AV-2..." and so on.
The orbital can collapse into many other shapes. This means the shape of the orbital is changing and probability regions shift at random intervalls. It could also mean that
more
superior verses (not superior to the orbital) will be prominant depending on the darkness and brightness of the orbital regions.
The orbital has many energy levels and each level represents a probability spectrum change.(A different orbital)  Remember,  the darker the verse is the more probability of superior verses but at a varrying quantity (Quality > Quantity) If it's lighter, then it's the oppesite. (Quantity > Quality)

Delta harpons on E6 is used to show that this is the maximum sublevels of 1.2.3.4.
Impossible theoretical levels exist. It's hard for this verse to reach E7.  It's equvilent to acheiving a fusion reaction here on Earth completly by itself. The E8 version would be so dark that you'd be ONLY seeing

s all around. Only tiny white specks remain.  Uo-1 means: Unknown-1 in abbreviation and it continues like this. There is no way to picture this orbital because it's complete darkness.
E8 would have the sublevels:  N-small, N-medium, N-huge , N-HYPER HUGE. Same explenation as E8, but it's more likely that this energy level could be reached, doesn't mean it will for sure.
E9 would have zero to the powered of down arrows as sub levels. Those random symbols show that it's improbable that this sublevel will be reached. It is invalid. But one thing that supports their possibility is that you can theoreticaly continue putting energy into the system. However,  reaching those energies are very much impossible.
Continuing!
This is very simple to understand.  Each level means a different orbital shape that is darker as you progress through the levels,  while each sublevel is a darker version out of that orbital.
E-1 orbital
This orbital is more concentrated with inferior verses. It's probability regions are also significantly smaller.
This what all E-2 orbitals look like.  This is sublevel BV1 looks like. There are darker versions of this orbital, but it's not darker then E3.    It's probability regions have expanded rapidly. Making more place for superior and inferior verses.
E-3 is slightly darker then the darkest E2 sublevel. The probability regions have expanded.  All variants of E3 are lighter then E4.  (E-4 is the one displayed on top of the article).
E-4 -> E-5 is a very significant raise in energy level. The probabilty regions are further spread out, but it's a lot more darker.  This is a neat region for superior verses to form.  What happened to the inferior verses? They are there,  just... Look harder for them. Oh wait! Uncertainty principle lel...
E-6 is the highest energy level.  But there are higher theoretical levels that are yet to be explained. At this point the orbital has a few more sublevels that appear to fade out of existance.
