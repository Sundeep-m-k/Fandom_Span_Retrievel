A
Protoverse
is an infinitely small type of
verse
, having the purpose of being the beginning of every single verse in our local
Omniverse
and many others. They can be found everywhere, and can be moved anywhere through everything. They are also one of elementary
building blocks
of
existence
.
Nearly every verse there, regardless of its degree of alienness, has the Protoverses as their starting seed. When they collide with an invisible
Chaos Particle
, they go
Big Bang
to form new
Universes
with their own unique laws (laws dependent on which
Multiverse
it is located in). The highest probability of these collisions is at the center of a gravitational singularity, as since things are very close together, a Chaos Particle and a protoverse are bound to interact.
Protoverses aren't normal verses in the same fashion as verses are verses, but rather because it adheres to many conditions that verses fall under. They have a force field as its surface, with which it interacts with other Protoverses, and has its own set of laws, which are few numbered. Even phenomena such as internal energy in any verse is partially or entirely made out of highly excited Protoverses of strange and extreme properties.
Construction
[
]
Protoverses seem to be constructed as a spherical shape consisting of
Blueprint Particles
from the vertices, connecting with a single, white
Existence-1 Blueprint Particle
at the center. It is one of the 2 primary
protospatial
particle
types, only residing with the nonexistence variant,
Nulliroto
