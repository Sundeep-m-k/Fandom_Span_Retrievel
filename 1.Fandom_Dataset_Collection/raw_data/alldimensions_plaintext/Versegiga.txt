Introduction
[
]
Versegigas
(also known as Nanoverses) are
teeny weeny little
verses
that are the opposite of the
Gigaverses
, hence their name. The
lifeforms
within them consist mostly of tiny little dogs known as "Liittllee Doggss".

These dogs are so small (with a size of -10
108
ly small) that they can live in versegigas! They also are special dogs that don't have to worry about any known type of radiation! That's crazy!
But I don't remember asking.
