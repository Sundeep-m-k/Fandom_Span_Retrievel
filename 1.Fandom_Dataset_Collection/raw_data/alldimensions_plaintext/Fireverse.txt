The
Fireverse
is a distinct and fiery dimension, as its name suggests. It's ranked as the 12th hottest verse, boasting an incredibly scorching temperature of 1,800Â°F, which coincides with the actual temperature of fire. While it may not be the absolute hottest, that distinction belongs to the
Calideissoleverse
and every

, it still blazes with intense heat. It's important to note that the Fireverse doesn't have the ability to ignite other universes, but any entity native to the Fireverse, known as a "Fireversian," would immediately burst into flames in such a fiery environment. As for popular alternatives, Pyroverses are often sought out as less incendiary alternatives within the multiverse.
