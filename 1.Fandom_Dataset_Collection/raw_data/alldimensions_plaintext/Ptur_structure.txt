Ptur structures
are massive structures similar to
cletr structures
comprised of specifically extremely large
universe filaments,
as opposed to the more normal sized ones that form in cletr structures. They are 3,884,000,000x rarer than cletr structures, and form much the same way, but start with large filaments joined. The reason why they form in the shape they do is unknown as of now. Ptur structures were first observed in 2004, although they were not confirmed to exist until 2016. These structures can remain stable for sextillions of years, unlike cletr structures, which only remain stable for quintillions of years before collapsing and converting all of its matter into subatomic particles.The largest ptur structure could be 2 sextillion light years across.
