An Anchorverse (Shey'ap'bok Prob in
The Pencil Language
) is a verse which
cannot be moved or rotated
.
Anchorverses are created when a verse gets too close to
The Verse Trap
, possibly turning the verse into an Anchorverse. No other way of creating Anchorverses have been found.
For civilizations inside an Anchorverse, they are at a much higher risk of being attacked due to their home verse not being able to be moved, letting enemies find the Anchorverse very easily. However, the civilizations have built elaborate defenses and disguises as a counter to an Anchorverse's downsides.
Anchorverses have
a significantly stronger barrier than most other verses
, making exiting an Anchorverse very hard. Different Anchorverses have different barrier thicknesses.
Anchorverses have been found to be
concentrated at certain areas in the
Omniverse
. It is thought that these locations are where The Verse Trap usually goes to.
