The Infion is an essential particle, specifically a
Embodied Material
with an infinite density of
Nanodust
. This property leads to some interesting use cases and consequences, like the fact that an Infion can be partitioned into copies of itself.
Infions are typically found in trace amounts as leftovers of infinite tier verses (for example, an
Omniverse
), although a few Infions are enough to use some of its more exotic properties.

Energy distribution
[
]
When an Infion interacts with most forms of energy, the Infion will homogeneously distribute the energy among the
Nanodust
within it. This is useful in a variety of ways, including:
Infinite storage of energy with a macroscopic half-life
Energy that emits evenly in all directions
Stabilizing large forces, for example the gravity of a
Black Hole
Replication
[
]
In the event that an Infion holds a total amount of energy on the scale of or beyond Ï‰, it will split into multiple even parts. These parts will then spread out over time, while maintaining constant density (an infinite number divided by a finite number is usually the same infinite number, regardless of the denominator). This is applicable in the following situations:
Verse
creation
Quickly blanking a
Verse
by making the target fully homo genus  (when combined with the fact that Infions make energy into them omnidirectional)
Creating matter or energy from nothing
Paradoxes
[
]
When combined with
Hierarchion
, the particle of laws and hierarchy, it will form an alloy with properties bypassing infinite verse hierarchies. Due to verse laws generally loosening as hierarchies are traversed, the alloy can form paradoxical and broken situations within basically anything.
The paradoxes are stronger than
Glitchonicite
's broken-ness, making Infions a prime target to be used in escaping large verses like End-All-Be-Alls.
