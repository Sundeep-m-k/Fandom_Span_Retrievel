What did you expect? Did you actually expect this to be the best verse ever? No, you probably didn't.
The problem with things that are named like this is that people don't have high expectations for them. If you want people to read your article, don't call it "best verse ever". It is most likely not going to get people's attention.
However, why did YOU decide to go onto this verse? You obviously didn't think that this actually WAS going to be the best verse ever, so why did you? You must have thought that it would be a bad article. So does that make calling an article "best verse ever" a good effect?
Unfortunately, no. Most people would actually think that it is not worth their time, and wouldn't look at it. Reverse psychology is very risky, and I don't recommend it.
