Infinifold
is a region of
a Box
and
Hyper-Space
, which binds
Boxial Core
layers at the direction of a new looped dimension. Significantly, Infinifold's composition goes in the order of size. When one move through a Boxial Core, it moves upwards in the Infinifold; allowing for traversing throughout
Infinityverses
safely. However, this is dangerous as one could split when traversing through a core.
Infinifolds are hidden throughout an
existence rank
other than the Box's ranks, and could only be accessible by superexisting and beyond. These are extremely rare, as it uses infinite looped dimensions from Infinityverses. To access, you have to use Logicium to become meta-disordered onto a dimension. One is cautioned that it should be suddenly reordered to go further inwards/outwards. There is the lower border at the scale containing the smallest Infinityverse.
At exits, you may find yourself a variant of
the Outside
, which makes it more dangerous unless you supply with Logicium. The Outside has a factor that it would be stretched and disordered towards an Infinity, turning it towards a
null existence
.
Sub-regions

Surprising, there are infinitely rare patches in Infinifolds which focuses on powers of omegas that the exponent isn't a integer. These patches are only found at unexpected
Le Jorino Areas
which is rare as
Archverse
layers, or inbetween
Boxial Voids
. However, as the exponent isn't integer, it should be avoided at no costs, as particles can't hold between finite and infinite factors of forces. They have imaginary forces of dimensionalities, because infinite dimensions are fully occupied; and may land onto
Imaginarium
.
