Conceptual Manipulation/Creation/Destruction: Allows THE CREATOR to fully change, delete, and add concepts to reality itself, such as adding concepts of space or deleting the concept of sitting down for example.
Universal Creation: Allows THE CREATOR to create universes with raw power easily while manipulating what occurs inside of them.
World Warp: THE CREATOR can warp between any dimension or type of verse as it wishes, however there is a certain limit to how far it can travel (Limited at the 6th Dimension and High-Omniverses.)
All-Seeing: THE CREATOR can see at anyones memories, being able to delete memories, add memories, extract memories, or retrieve memories to entities at its own will. It can also read thoughts whenever it wants, and this allows THE CREATOR to view almost any battle in advance to win.
Overture: THE CREATOR can view through billions if not higher of timelines within seconds to a normal entity, being able to see ever fate and outcome of a battle and pick one where everything goes right for it. If nothing goes right, what happens is truly unknown, yet most likely its downfall.
Reign of Chaos: THE CREATOR rains chaos upon a dimension or universe where everything shatters within red energy to then explode, shattering the entire dimension/universe into bits and pieces with only shards in a red outline floating in space.
Resurrection: THE CREATOR can constantly revive an entity until they can't handle it anymore and their body wears out.

THE CREATOR
TRUE REALITY is the name given by
THE CREATOR
as one of its greatest creations throughout millions of terayears (1,000,000,000,000 years) of his existence.
THE CREATOR
made this place as a unique afterlife for any entities that existed in his universes and multiverses that he made would go to for indentured service. The universes and multiverses last for a normal lifespan and have the same size as their normal version; however, they are not naturally created with normal energy but instead artificially created with power to run like a simulation. These universes run perfectly normal even under these conditions, however the entities inside are limited by the
THE CREATOR.
Beings that try to surpass even a fragment of universal levels are sent out to be eliminated from their home and be sent to TRUE REALITY as their afterlife. However, these more powerful entities are given a more unique purpose then just as a slave for energy harvesting.

TRUE REALITY
[
]
TRUE REALITY's major part is eternal slavery, and the more powerful the entity apart of
THE CREATOR
's creations is, the more abused and overworked they are. In the TRUE REALITY, life and death isn't a concept to be told. Only eternal suffering with life, death just being something that exists for the fun of it.
THE CREATOR
uses this unique program to share energy and resources from his large mine, even allowing others like him to use his uniquely crafted afterlife to generate profit themselves. The TRUE REALITY is an infinite space, the most explored of it being a few universes of area merely. The further out an entity goes through THE TRUE REALITY, the buggier and glitchy the reality become similar to the
Farlands
, reality glitching out with pink 0's and 1's flying around. Entities and scripts escape, ruling these sections with mere animalistic intelligence but also more dangerous and corrupted.
INDENTURED SERVICE
[
]
Entities in his worlds when they reach the TRUE REALITY reach no paradise or hell as any religion may have said that they had created. After 'death,' they stay alive for eons if not longer slaving away in the far mines of the TRUE REALITY, mining resources for
THE CREATOR
to use for his own purpose and as a unique essence to build life. What these minerals are is unknown, all that is known that they are used as drugs also to gods, said to be one of the most potent godlike drugs ever used. If a normal being not even close to godlike status used this, they would either die or within a 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000 (1 quadrillion) chance, survive and attain the power of a god.
HIGHER BEINGS
[
]
Higher scaled entities in his worlds when they reach the TRUE REALITY are sent to a different set of jobs instead of low-level mining. They only live for a few million years in their jobs painfully or sometimes eons, fighting in the edges of the TRUE REALITY. Entities there reach from continental strength up to a part-primordial scale, and the more powerful they are, the more unpredictable and glitchy they show. The stronger the entity here, the harder the enemy. If they die, they are repeatedly resurrected until they die to the very corruption and flaws of the reality. The bodies of the entities roaming deep in the TRUE REALITY are brought back to
THE CREATOR
to absorb their energy and amass his power and strength infinitely. Though it usually isn't much, it allows
THE CREATOR
to passively become more and more powerful.
OTHER RULERS
[
]
Specifically,
THE CREATOR
with his TRUE REALITY allows other beings weaker or similar to strength in him to use his TRUE REALITY in exchange of around 65% of the energy obtained. The other ruler can then keep the rest in part of constantly gaining energy as a result. The TRUE REALITY with beings not from
THE CREATOR
's creations will source their origin with a unique check to make sure if the entity is allowed. If they are not allowed into the TRUE REALITY, their entire force is destroyed and shattered into the parts of the mine, lost in the near-infinite expanse of the mines. (Note the mines are not fully infinite, the 'farlands' are infinite.) If they are allowed, they are given a separate job where these other entities are forced to handle extremely dangerous materials that create universes with
THE CREATOR's
hand, and they last a few million years usually with enough constant resurrections.
THEM
(WIP)
[
]
As stated before, in the very-very far edges of the TRUE REALITY rests glitched and errored entities that rule and conquer the space they inhabit. They are not friendly to each other and have no sense of emotion or human thought depending on how deep they are in the TRUE REALITY. The dumber, the stronger, this expanding outward the further the entity survives in the farlands of the TRUE REALITY. Some however defy the logic of becoming dumber and can construct civilizations and weapons from their own kind (via enslavement or teamwork) and sometimes forming sentience with proper management instead of absolute war. There are 18
discovered
classes of entities that exist in the farlands, and 5
sub-classes
known so far.
Main Classes
[
]
Energy Stealing
[
]
High-Tier entities past B-10 (chances past that dwindle to billions or trillions) can energy steal from their own kind or even dead slaves by grasping the region where the heart is located, clenching on it before creating a purple triangular beam that begins to dig into the body. If the host is alive, then the transfer will kill and siphon the strength of the person and even learn their techniques or better learn their own techniques from them. IQ cannot be siphoned as an odd anomaly, neither can corruption.
Corruption
[
]
Any class of entity can possess corruption, however the weaker the scale the harder it is. The only way to gain more corruption is to venture lightyears of distance in the TRUE REALITY to even gain an ick of percent of corruption, and the more you have, the exponentially harder it becomes to rack up more and more. The less corruption you have, the lower the tier and the more sentience you have, however the higher the corruption, the stronger and more abilities you have, however you become extremely dumb the more it stacks up and lose your 'humanity'. Entities in the farlands aren't the only ones who can obtain corruption, such as slaves of the TRUE REALITY or gods themselves, however it can be dangerous for non-TRUE REALITY based entities to become corrupted as it can lead to an easier death since the substance is extremely dangerous for a non-bugged entity to obtain. (The only exception of non-TRUE REALITY entities to become corrupted are beings with similar traits to them.)
Abilities
[
]
Entities such as A-5 or higher will share the abilities as their previous form, such as A-7 inheriting
Corrupting Slash
. Their techniques however are
weaker
then the original tier, yet can be enhanced with
energy stealing
.
A-(1-7)
[
]
Classes through A-1 through A-7 are the weakest variants of entities. They are however also the smartest by far. These beings usually have the strongest grip of normal sense, barley affected by the faults in the TRUE REALITY and are barley passive but still aggressive to a certain degree. These are usually constructers for higher tier entities with sub-classes. For their general abilities, they are usually none for the lowest of the group.

B-(8-13)
[
]
Classes through B-8 and B-13 are higher tier entities that possess strengths in groups that can kill most weak slaves while inflicting pain. Most entities with this class have a guarteened ability excluding defects and are made of a higher corrupted percentage, with some being made from the corruption. The drop of IQ slows down at this point, however the rates of everything else is mostly unchanged except corruption, which is more prominent in the entities higher then tier 8. Rarely, B-12 or B-13 can mutate through corruption around them where they can begin to form sentience and rule over other and smarter entities with their highly immense power. These two also have a high rise in power, with begins to become more noticeable with higher evolution in the species. B-10 and higher can also unlock
energy stealing
.

Absolute Flight: The entity gains literal flight alongside an aura that destroys any other things in aviation nearby, allowing them to have the high ground over anything they want.
Corrupted Blade of the Dimensions: The blade of the dimensions is given in a heavily weakened form and corrupted in a blacked form, covered in zeros and ones in a deep purple color. Allows the entity to throw it with it always coming back.

Keep Up: Hundreds of slashes are launched at the target, hitting so precisely to cut cells in half. This can happen in barley a nanosecond (at peak strength) and almost impossible to counter if you cannot see it incoming. However, the user of this has a
charge-up
cooldown of
0.11
seconds to throw the slash, so it can be countered. But the stronger the tier, the faster the cooldown becomes.
Your Friend: A small black gooey creature latches upon an attacking target before exploding in their face or sucking their blood out while attacking the central organ system and the nervous system within a few minutes. Can be killed with powerful attack only, punching it won't help.
