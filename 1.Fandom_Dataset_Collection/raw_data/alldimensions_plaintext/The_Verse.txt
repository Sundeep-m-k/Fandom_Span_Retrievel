The Verse's guardian?
About
[
]
A
Verse
is an extremely large type of structure that many consider the "apex of existence", however this is not true, for they're contained by
something higher
.
The Verses are an example of an important milestone in the hierarchy of greater existence for it marks the last place any empire has reached for now, and it will stay that way for quadrillions of eons
.

Cabinet randomness
[
]
Their
Cabinets
are all mind-bogglingly different from one-another, to the point that uniting them has only been achieved by one, extremely single-
species
centered
empire
within our
Obice Novissimo
.
Rogue cosmic structures
[
]
The Verses are one of the few infinite structures to have
rogue
planets
and
stars
, most of which are habitable but uninhabited, like they're
waiting
for colonization.
The Verse's guardian?
[
]
Tons of
individuals
from our wonderous Verse believe that some sort of cosmic entiy is guarding them, but no known cosmic entity in it has been powerful enough to run anything above a
Triple Existence
known so far. Perhaps this entity still is undiscovered, but nobody is sure.
