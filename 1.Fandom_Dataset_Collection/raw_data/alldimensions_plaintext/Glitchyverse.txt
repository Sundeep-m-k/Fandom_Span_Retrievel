Not to be confused with the
GLITCHverses
.
The
Glitchyverse
is one of the 8 major realms that embody
THE 8 DIVINE GODS
of the
Primordialverse
, just less half of the matter is made of normal matter, and the rest is made from
Glitch Matter
permeating the reality as a whole. Its shape is a 6 dimensional hypertriangle, which is one of 8 faces (each of THE 8 DIVINE GODS) in a 7 dimensional hypertriangle.
The Glitchyverse works in such a way it does not have defined laws of physics. For example: for one period of time a wall could become bendy and flexible, the next it could literally become a liquid, or a cup could be perfectly normal for a second, but then all of a sudden the cup becomes quark gluon plasma the liquid inside of it could start flowing up in all different directions.
Surprisingly, life actually does exist in this dimension, although just not made of normal 'baryonic matter'.
Beings
known as "
Chaos Entities
" which are made of Glitch Matter are the only living beings that can physically withstand the impossible conditions.
