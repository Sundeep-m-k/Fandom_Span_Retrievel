The Golden Heretic, Yharim, possesses strength that may just surpass all of the Gods. When you face him, be well prepared for the battle of your life. - Sea King
Yharim is a cosmic entity. When the battle was finally over, the dust having just began to settle. Where even the stone refused the course of time, there sat a monk. Who dared to question history and stare into fate. 'What is the true price of the past being ever eternal? Why must our future forever haunt us?'
