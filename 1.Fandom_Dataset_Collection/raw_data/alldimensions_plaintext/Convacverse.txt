The
Convacverse
is a special kind of verse found throughout many other different verses, most commonly
The Box
. No Convacverses have been found in
Omniverses
, however due to difficulties in measuring the verse's
Existence Rank
, it is unknown when they can exist there.

Description
[
]
The Convacverse appears to have a thin, nearly transparent boarder that can be passed through. Convacverses interact with gravity very weakly, which causes photons to curve around it and make a sort of rim appear around it, causing the border.
The inside of the Convacverse is unique in that it contains no
laws
. Additionally, the Convacverse also has none of the laws the verse it contains does, which sometimes puts into question if it really is contained by that verse. Objects that enter the Convacverse also lose all of their laws, and so they almost always disappear immediately unless the object has 'law regeneration' properties which were first discovered when experimenting with Convacverses.
Convacverses are always a hypersphere, and can very in size greatly. The smallest known Convacverse is ~0.87 millimeters in radius, and the largest known Convacverse is
ℵ
36
{\displaystyle \aleph_{36}}
light-years in diameter. The average size of Convacverses in The Box is approximately 1029 light-years in radius.
Discovery
[
]
The Convacverse was first discovered when a ship was exploring the outer regions of The Box, and passed through a Convacverse (it was small, approximated to 2.6 cm in radius). This caused a hole in the ship, however it was in a relatively insignificant area and was repaired easily afterwards. The surrounding area that the ship passed through was quickly surveyed and a Convacverse was found.
Now that their existence was known, many people were able to find other Convacverses of various sizes in The Box. Soon after that Convacverses were found outside The Box, and given an official name, due to their similar characteristics. Even still, most Convacverses are found in The Box.
Experimentation
[
]
In 11,401
OYC
, Suzanne Ross was given funding to study and generally expirement with Convacverses. A total of 4 different tests were performed, summarized here. A total of two Convacverses were experimented on, all in The Box.
Ininital Experimentation
[
]
Originally, random objects were just thrown into the Convacverse to see how normal objects interact with it. In total, a bowl of fruit
[

]
, 178 marbles, concrete and steel, a slice of raw ham
[
2
]
, an empty spacesuit
[
3
]
, and 3 types of cameras were thrown into the Convacverse to see the effects on the objects before attempting to investigate specific parts.
All of these objects except for one disentigrated near immediately within the Convacverse (the exact amount of time survived is hard to calculate because it's basically impossible to detect an object from outside). The orange launched within the fruit bowl was later observed leaving the Convacverse. The significance and cause of this is unknown.
Study of effects
[
]
The following experiments had to do with detecting where the effects of the Convacverse starts and if any objects are less effected by this.
Large-scale expirements
[
]
The first experiment consisted of a radio transmitter, which was dropped into the Convacverse to see at what point the signal stopped. Instead of the signal stopping when the transmitter was completely inside the Convacverse, it stopped when the wiring of the transmitter entered the Convacverse, suggesting that the material was actually destroyed, similar to a black hole. (Note: at this point, the orange had not yet exited the other side of the Convacverse).
In the second test, a single cell of bacteria (
E. coli
)
[

]
was placed inside a small metal box with systems detecting the status of the oorganism. The point of this was to see if a living oorganism is somehow invunerable. The oorganism dissapeared, showing that living objects are not invulnerable (note fruits are not themselves alive).
The crew of the ship relocate to a much smaller Convacverse, being about 3km in radius. Next, a very large sheet of steel that was around 1km in diameter was slowly inserted into the surface of the Convacverse, approximately 50 meters inside. It was then taken out again to show that the matter was, in fact, destroyed or at least removed from the original object. However, due to the pressure sensors placed regularly along the sheet not measuring any force, it seems that the steel was destroyed. The ship then returned to to the previous Convacverse of more average size.
Small-scale experiments
[
]
The next test consisted of a microscope that was tuned to look at several very small particles, such as
Blueprint Paricles
,
Protoverses
and
quarks
, to see if smaller particles were not effected by the Convacverse. The machine propelling the microscope was designed to move extremely precisely, so that the particles could be split down the middle
[

]
and pulled back out again. All the particles experimented on either disentigrated or decomposed into smaller elements inside of the particle, showing that they were destroyed like other large scale objects.
The final test consisted of progressively smaller particles being shot through a 'transmitter', and being detected by the 'reciever' if they came out the other side. Here is a list of the particles tested:
Particle
Result
Blueprint Particle
Failure. This test was simply to make sure previous experiments were valid.
⬤
Failure.
·
Failure.
Protoparticle
Unknown. the transmitter became misaligned here and all protoparticles taken were used.
Xeyon
Failure. Original test was misaligned but was corrected before all Xeyons were used up.
Voidonion
Failure.
Periodk
Failure. It's noted here that 'at this point modifications had to be made to the reciever to detect such small particles.'
Mathon
Failure.
Axion
Success. Axions were detected by the transmitter after the predicted amount of time expected from gravitational equations, also proving that the Convacverse's gravitational attraction held true inside the verse.
After the success of the Axion reciever, plans to study more into exactly how the Axions act inside the Convacverse were put into place.

The bowl of fruit contained 2 apples, 2 pears, a pineapple, an orange, a lemon and lime, 5 strawberries, a coconut, and a bunch of grapes.

To a certain point. Particles smaller than the Blueprint Particle are near-impossible to move this precicely even with very expensive and high precision equipment.

This is why the Blueprint Particle was the smallest particle experimented on.
