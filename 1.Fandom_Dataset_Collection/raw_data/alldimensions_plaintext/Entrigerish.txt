's, Each sentence is thus laid out with 3 lines for each sound type, like this:
HH-- X-F F-F |
-OU- EA- -AO |
B--D P-C DK- |
The language itself takes much inspiration from
Puffish
, and was mostly formed after they had come into contact with them. So it is easy to understand, a close approximation to the actual word will be put along with it. (Do not use this for speaking it, it is to be
very
clear that Entrigerish is
IMPOSSIBLE
for humans to speak) It is also to be noted that H is the most common consonant in the Entrigerish language and is present in practically
every
letter
