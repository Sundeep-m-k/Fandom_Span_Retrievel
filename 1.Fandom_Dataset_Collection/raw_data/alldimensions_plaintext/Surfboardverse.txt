This verse is not only another pointless verse, but it doesn't even have points in it. This one simply surfs on
The Wave
. Since it is a surfboard, it doesn't really do much. But since that is pretty much the whole point of this chain, it isn't.
The surfboard is actually high tech. This can actually move wherever it wants because of the cosmic thrusters. Even though it still doesn't have many defining features, all of this together makes a really cool verse that people would now want to visit.
