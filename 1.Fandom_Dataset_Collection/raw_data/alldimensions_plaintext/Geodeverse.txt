The
Geodeverse
is a post-boxial verse within the
MeOMultiverse,
known for its vast collection of cosmic geodes shielded by brightly glowing Boxes. The boxes are wrapped around enormous geodes of higher dimensions than the boxes themselves as shells. When carefully removed, the geodes have been shown to be the sources of the brightness, emitting a greyish light that gets filtered through The Box's white.
The insides of most geodes are filled with gem-like material that have no real counterpart in English or any language in the local Multiverse. They do have differing, and often insignificant effects on the immediate area around them (100 cubed boxes max in 3D terms, not much) that change not with the color, but the size of the gemstone in question.
When refined and hollowed out, these gems make decent living spaces if their physics-warping is Macroformed or safe for sapient beings due to their large area and relative softness. Chunks of these gems are also very profitable in lower inter-versal markets of all sorts due to their uniqueness to the Geodeverse.

These ores multiply the strength of gravity, strong nuclear forces, weak nuclear forces, and magnetism by anywhere from 1.065 to 1.302 depending on the gem's size in the category. Depending on the physics present in any local Box, this can either be the most devastating or most minor type of alteration.

At this size range, gemstones will begin to alter energy's relation to mass, causing energy to be more propulsive. It also takes less mass to produce the same amount of energy (~e = mc^1.5) in the affected area. These factors make medium gems the best for travel, and some civilizations have attempted to reshape the geodes to make travel lines elsewhere.

The smallest size's affects, of course including the smallest geode recorded, are the least intense of the possible affects. In these gems, blueprint particles outside the core of the geode have an extremely miniscule (1/3.34 * 10^78) chance every few milliseconds to multiply by any number ranging from 2 to 5. With a few well-placed Chance Manipulators, it's easy to see in action. The luckiest of the smaller gems have even begun to grow a new layer of boxial matter on their outside.
