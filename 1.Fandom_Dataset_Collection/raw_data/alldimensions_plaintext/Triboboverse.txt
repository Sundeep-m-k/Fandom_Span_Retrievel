Rules
[
]
Define this as the
☊
☊(Ω)
(Ω)th layer of boboverses, each boboverse going thru each of these rules: each boboverse layer gets a tier upgrade (i.e the first boboverse layer contains Ω levels of verses. The second boboverse layer will be it is the Ω Layer of archverse-like verse's, each layer having Ω Layers of Normal-like verse's. The third having Ω layers of biboboverses, each containing Ω of the last verse, and layering on top of each other by having there first verse layer as the last layer for a diffrent layer. etc.)
Color
[
]
The color comes from matter being so big that it has to colapse into a singularity. somtimes, thoes singularities become so concentrated that they become a tier 2 singularity. here is a key to diffret tiers of singularitys and there colors:
red = tier 1 singularity
blue = tier 2 singularity
green = tier ω singularity
white = tier ω
ω

anything in between in unknown.
