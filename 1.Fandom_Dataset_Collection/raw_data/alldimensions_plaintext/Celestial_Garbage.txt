Celestial Garbage is, to put it simply, garbage. It has no value. You cannot construct anything with it. You cannot do anything with it. It cannot make sound. It has no use, and it cannot be destroyed. In fact, reports have said having it in your possession or being in the vicinity of it causes “a subtle feeling of emptiness”, and too much can induce feelings of dread, depression, emptiness, and “a deep, incurable sadness that was only lifted once I got rid of it.” It is therefore so undesirable that some humans may even feel an irresistible urge to get rid of it or attempt to destroy it, and some people who were exposed to it wasted their lives away trying to destroy it completely.
Getting rid of Celestial Garbage has even been reported to be the greatest pleasure of one’s life.
