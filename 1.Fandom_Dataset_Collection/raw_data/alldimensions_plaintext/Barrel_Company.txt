The Barrel Company is a company dedicated to aiding navigation of the Box, they sell
Barrels
. As of now, they pretty much have a monoply, nobody else has such a company. However, that might change in the future. (Note: This has changed:
Infinitely many companies that sell barrels have popped up throughout the Box, however the Barrel Company itself still has a monopoly over barrels
.)
The company was inspiried by navigators of
The Box
complaining how isolated parts of the Box were on a mission to colonize planets close to
Electrocosmos
, so that they could harness the energy.
Currently, they have
