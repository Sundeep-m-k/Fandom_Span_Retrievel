Not to be confused with the
Final fractalism
, the ultimate structure. They are related, though.

Scale
Size
An average
true kceh
to a Final fractal is like an
universe
to an
omniverse
in comparison, on average.
Some Final fractals can get larger, though.

true kcehs
Final fractals
are infinite collections of
true kceh
, the
class 22
terminators
and ALSO the ones of the
post-hierarchy
as a whole, thus being very important in the
hierarchies
. The problem is that every true kceh in them is competing with each other and every 0 seconds they become larger and larger.
The total age of some of these is beyond the concept of size + they contain themselves beyond the concept of size times. And if there was something more, then in 0 seconds they would become immeasurably more.
Their name is given due to their fractal shape and due to being portions of Final fractalism.
Formation
[
]
Final Fractals are formed when leftover Final Fractalism material forms to make inverted, smaller versions of itself, which turn into Final Fractals, which then use the leftover material to shape it into a fractal, similar to their "creator". When the true kceh grow larger, so does their Final Fractal.
