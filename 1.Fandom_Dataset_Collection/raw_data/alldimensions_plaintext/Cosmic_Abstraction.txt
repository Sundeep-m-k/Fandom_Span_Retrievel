An
Cosmic Abstraction
is a recursive generalization of the
Nultiverse
. Each layer of an Abstraction separates via encoding of a
Uqraek fiber
. Uqraek fibers can hold infinitely complex data structures, permitting many consecutive
Universes
to exist.
Higher layers, especially those that go outside of a
Multiverse
, may have variable axioms of physics. This effect is amplified with greater distance.

Cosmic Abstraction is one of the most powerful voids, because it is only 0.00001% matter, and the 'matter' is just letters. Fill in the void by
