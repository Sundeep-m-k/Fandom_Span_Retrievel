The Supremum of Chaos
is the second smallest antipode of the
Grasslands
.
It is the totality, end, and maximum of chaos, unpredictability, and randomness. A vessel of total unpredictability, disorientation, and unorderness.
The dimensionality used the
C
n
{\displaystyle \mathcal{C_n}}
function. This is the chaos function. When combined and used with other functions, mainly the order function
O
n
{\displaystyle \mathcal{O_n}}
, it outputs specific properties of chaos of a thing. Here, we can define
C
{\displaystyle \mathcal{C}}
as the totality of chaos itself.
An interesting property naturally arises from the order and chaos functions, where the existence rank of a thing
α
{\displaystyle \alpha}
is equal to
O
α
+
C
α
{\displaystyle \mathcal{O}_{\alpha} + \mathcal{C}_{\alpha}}
.
The
Thubbunurrhypil
, or "white heads", more distorted this time than the
Supremums of Order
, concentrates at one point into a mixture of total uninterpretation.
The Supremum of Chaos is
heavily theorized to be interlinked with the Supremums of Order in more than many ways.
Order and chaos are themselves strongly connected, so it is only reasonable to consider the primary for the finalities of both. There is, however,
more evidence to suggest those claims. More than just speculations, as it turns out
. The leading theory states that the singularities of the Supremum of Chaos and the Supremums of Order are the same, that is to say,
these two share the same singularity.
The Thubbunurrhypil of the Supremums of Order appear slightly different from that of the Supremums of Chao
s
. It is unknown whether these are two different beings or the same, possibly even different species and have a common ancestor.
