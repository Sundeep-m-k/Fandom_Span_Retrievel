The
Omnipoverse
is a verse that is 100% filled to the brim with
Omniplasms
(giving it its alternate name - "Omniplasm Cluster". There is no empty space in this verse due to this fact, and it is extremely cramped despite it being {10,10,100} times bigger than the average
Omniplasm
. However, no two Omnipoverses are the same as they have infinite configurations of
Omniplasms
, which themselves have infinite configurations. It is unknown how the Omniplasms dont collide and by consequence destroy eachother.
Even though the Omnipoverse is indescribably gigantic, it still doesn't even make it to the atomic scale from a post-alphasmic perspective. It could be compared to a proton or neutron, but this comparison is usually made with
Phasomniverses
instead.
Phasomniverses are essential in the creation of larger post-alphasm objects, and without them they would not exist.
