BOOD-VOOD-VAV
A
Dark One
, or "Vood-Ii-Jes" in
Puffish
), are dark
entities
that
BOOD-VOOD-VAV
controls, made entirely of
Primordium Omega
, except for a core of
Primordium Delta
in their centre.
These dark beings are created whenever a lifeform which has commited UNSPEAKABLE ATROCITIES is judged by
BOOD-ROW-VAV
, and is thrown into BOOD-VOOD-VAV's realm, called 'BOOD VOOD-PRUC HAAT ZLAA-JAC', where they will decay until all that is left is a empty, cursed creature, much more powerful than the being which came in.
FORMULA FOR POWER INCREASE
[
]
The formula for calculating how much more strong it will get when corrupted is this formula:
P
c
= (P
n
* 9)
2
+ P
n
3
For example, if we have an average humans 'Power level' as 10, then, applying it to the formula:
P
c
= (1 * 9)
2
+ 1
3
= 9
2
+ 1
3
= 81 + 1
= 82
Meaning a human will get 8.2x stronger if it were to become a dark one.
Some Dark Ones become too powerful when being transformed and become self conscious, with a will of their own, these usually escape and become rogues.
