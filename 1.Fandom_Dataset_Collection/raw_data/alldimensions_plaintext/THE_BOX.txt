THE BOX
(Also known as V&D Box, not to be confused with
"normal" ones
, the terminators of
class 1
) is the true
Box
. It contains everything, nothing, and anything in-between. Instead of containing objects with an
Existence Rank
of 0 and 1, its contains
everything
with every
Existence Rank
possible and impossible, making this structure a very incomprehensible one.
This is beyond everything.
