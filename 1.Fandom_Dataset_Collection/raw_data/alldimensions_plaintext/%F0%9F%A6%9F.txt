T = every value from the entire internet through all real time summed and tetrated to itself infinitely

ğŸ¦Ÿ shares the same properties as
ğŸ¦ 
to not make it self destruct.
If more numbers are created in the internet, it WONT change ğŸ¦Ÿ's value, since ğŸ¦Ÿ is so powerful it already knows all the numbers that will ever be added in it before they even exist.
Any logic countering the absorption is countered by ğŸ¦Ÿ back, meaning no number resists it.

Negative numbers get turned into positive for the calculation of ğŸ¦Ÿ. Decimals get turned into numbers AT LEAST above 1. Example: 0,2 gets turned into 2, 0,13412134 gets turned into 1,3412134, etc.
Each value in general gets tetrated by the one bigger than it. Example: 1
7
213
1000
In fact, ğŸ¦Ÿ is basically a buffed ğŸ¦ , and a nerfed
