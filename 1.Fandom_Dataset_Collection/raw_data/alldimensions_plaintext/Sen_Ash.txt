Lore

When Neon cloned herself,
the man of Fate
was dissatisfied. The man of Fate made her go insane and drink poison. He told all the clones that they were made for an experiment, unaware they had M.I.A.M. Sen saw this an opportunity to kill the clones, also unaware that they had M.I.A.M. Sen made a dagger disguised as a marker that she called “The Sharpie”, and attempted to assassinate the other clones.
Her first victim was Mina. She was found hiding in an alley. Sen looked at Mina’s eyes and instantly knew that they were a clone of Neon. Mina was holding a trash bag and was trying to use it as a shield. Sen pulled out the Sharpie and took off the lid revealing the knife-like inside. She stabbed it through the trash bag and through Mina’s heart. She stole Mina’s hat.
Her second victim was Jennie. She was found sitting on a bench. Sen looked at Jennie’s eyes, they were a clone. Jennie was holding nothing. She had accepted her fate. Sen pulled out the Sharpie and Jennie was stabbed in the heart. She stole Jennie’s dress.
She then saw Korku. He was found on the top of a building about to jump off and suicide. Sen was shocked by this sight. Korku did the job himself, and died.
