The ultimate form of transportation. The bus's purpose is to transport cosmic beings to other places, but it is very difficult to do this. As such, the driver
American Boot
has overclocked the engine and now the bus is super fast. So fast it can travel from one side of the box to the opposite side in just a single and a half
OYC
days. But the bus is ridiculously expensive, the reason why is because the fuel costs a crap ton of money, and if he goes too fast the engine will be damaged. The bus is incredibly durable as well, as only a few has managed to break the bus. However the driver is in crippling debt because of how much the fuel costs, so the bus can only be used every 100
OYC
days.
