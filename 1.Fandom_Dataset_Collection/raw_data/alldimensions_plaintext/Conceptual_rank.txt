The
conceptual rank
is a unit of measurement similar to
Existence Ranks
.
Here is a list of all the conceptual ranks:
0 conceptual rank is absolute non-existence. It is difficult to explain it , but keep in mind that all its objects are contained in nothing. Their
hyper-dimensionality
is -H (9-). objects below 0 conceptual rank are nonconceptual / preconceptual.
example:
yarron
1 conceptual rank: these are ordinary objects.Â  All existing, non-existent, possible and impossible ranks of existence are 1 conceptual rank.
Example:
TOH
,
TEH.
2 conceptual rank: post-alphasm entities. these are still conceptual but have higher finality index
Example:
alphasm
,
frickslive
3 conceptual rank: higher digital realities
Example:
wikiverse
4 conceptual rank:loop
Example:
you reached earth again
OTHER
-1 conceptual rank: unknowable and indescribable. below conceptuality
Example: anti logic (coming soon)
1.5 conceptual rank: consciousness of the alphasm .
Example:
1st realm
,
2rd realm
1.1-1.4 conceptrual rank: pre- alphasm  simulations
Example:
space time simulation
, ( space time simulations and bigger verses have 1.1 conceptual rank)
terminal terminal
(terminal tirminal and bigger verses have 1.4 conceptual ramk.)
0.00000000000001 - 0.999999999999 conceptual rank: still contained inside nothing, but the greater the conceptual rank, the more it looks like an ordinary thing. this is used as a loophole to make objects less than nothing.
Example:
conceptual gate
half conceptual verse
2.5 conceptual rank: the embodiment of all TOG's fantasies. In fact, this is just a small detail. To understand this rank, you need full-page information. Soon I will create a meta-web and you will understand everything
Example: metaweb (coming soon)
2.1-2.4 conceptual rank: post alphasm simulations
Example:
Computer of Eternity
(Computer of Eternity and bigger verses have 2.1 conceptual rank)
3.5 conceptual rank: intelligent hologram
intelligent hologram
coming soon......
