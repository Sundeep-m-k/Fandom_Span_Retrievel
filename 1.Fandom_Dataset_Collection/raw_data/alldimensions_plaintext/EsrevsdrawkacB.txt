History of this verse.
[
]
Anti-matter, which is the opposite of matter, has Anti-Particles which a negative charge when was interacting with ordinary matter, instead of TOTAL ANNIHILATION, The anti-matter (Anti-Atoms) got flung from our universe, and after 2 and 1/2 years, started to backwards in time and the Anti-M started grow to enormous sizes, instead of collapsing a long time ago, which its current size is -31 Dark-Days. everything started going back to its original place when it collided with normal matter. It collides every 2 and 1/2 years with our universe, although its only a few anti-atoms in size when it collides with our universe, just like it was when it hit normal matter, so it doesn't do anything to our universe.
How time works in this verse.

Imagine this, in our universe, time goes forward, so when you put food coloring, it spreads over the water, and in another universe, the food coloring was already in the water, and when you came, you "Sucked" the food coloring back in your dropper, just like our universe, but in backwards. Like i said before, the atoms has a special negative charge and causes time to go backwards.
