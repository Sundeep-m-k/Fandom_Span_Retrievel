The FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg
is the last egg, and also the biggest one. It has a lot of
giant eggs
attached to the outer shell because the main part is in the middle. There is a giant sphere that has its own gravity, but the sphere is made out of eight different sections which are all completely different from each other. This is why the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg is so weird.

The Thing
The giant eggs
[
]
There are a lot of giant eggs on the outer shell, this is because the outside of giant eggs are always sticky, and these eggs are stuck to the shell of the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg because the giant eggs have magnets in them that repel them away from the core in the middle and then eventually, they stick to the shell. The shell also has an opposite magnet from the magnets in the giant eggs so the giant eggs really stick to the shell.
These eggs don't do much but there have been a few small cracks on the inside of the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg so the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg might break soon but the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg also has bonds in the material so the shell joins back together after a few months automatically so this will only happen if a lot of eggs hit it simultaneously, and there aren't many giant eggs left floating in the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg anymore, so this is unlikely to happen.
The Sphere
[
]
The Sphere in the middle is actually called the "FRICKIN GINORMOUS THING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FRICKIN GINORMOUS EGG THAT HAS EIGHT DIFFERENT COLOURFUL SECTIONS THAT ARE ALL VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER HAVING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THEMES AND DIMENSIONS AND THE MIDDLE HAS ITS OWN GRAVITY AND THE SPHERE IS USED TO KEEP THE EGG STABLE AND HOLD LIFE", but nobody calls it that because the name is way too long. However, the name is pretty much a valid description of what The Sphere actually is.
The Sphere has two different sections to it, the middle of it and then the outside. The Sphere's overall diameter is 1 ly.
The Middle
[
]
The middle is made of iron because someone jabbed it in there. It used to be nonexistent and the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg had no gravity, but someone wanted to give it gravity and a reason to exist since they found it interesting so they jabbed a bunch of iron into the middle of it and now it has gravity.
This part has really high gravity because it has an equal amount of pressure from every direction of the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg. This causes it to have gravity and the outside of this Sphere was really close to it at the time so it joined together with the middle and it got gravity, but the outside of the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg did not get pulled to it.
The middle of it doesn't really have any purpose other than that, it's just a bunch of iron.

The Outside
[
]
The Outside is the main section of The Sphere and it is divided into eight sections. All of these sections are completely different from each other because they were originally a bunch of different spheres but they all joined together when they got near each other. For a while, it only had seven sections and there was another sphere floating around the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg, but it eventually joined in.
The Eight Sphere Sections
[
]
White Section
[
]
The White Section is the oldest section out of the eight. It simply consists of plain white surface with no sound. This is likely a side effect of the shell of the giant egg being completely white as well, but this section has absolutely nothing on it, and there is no sound. However, there is subtle white fog. It is 4 dimensional.
Geometrical Section
[
]
There is a green section that is the biggest section of them all, taking up 19.04% of The Sphere's surface area. This part is very geometric, with the ground being made of polygons and polyhedra and polychorons, and then there are random floating geometric things in the air.
The material is mostly hard, but there are some small patches of clay-like material that can be moved around to make things or dig deep holes. Some of the patches go very deep and the deepest one goes over 10% down to the core. This material will emit dust if you move it too often.
Occasionally, someone might stumble across a yellow version of this material. This type is similar to regular sand, and you can basically take it anywhere. However, this material is very rare in this section. These types exist because the way the verse is generated sometimes creates shapes that are way too small, and if there are enough next to each other, they simply won't hold together anymore and turn into yellow sand. Therefore, this sand never becomes geometric because it completely lost the geometric property, it is basically just regular sand.
Deeper down, there is a noticeable gradient that becomes a darker and darker green. This is because the hard material from the section gets more dense and higher pressure, so the colour gets darker because of the properties of this specific material. This section is 5-dimensional.
Repulsive Section
[
]
The Repulsive Section repels you from the surface, so combined with the gravity of the core, this section appears to have no gravity since they balance out. When this section was separate from the Sphere, it just repelled everything away, but now it is actually habitable and has a few microorganisms. Also, it is a purple section. It is a very flat section but there are a few really tall hills on it that you can climb and there are also a bunch of things the microorganisms have made by stacking themselves on top of each other because there are a lot of microorganisms. The microorganisms can stack on top of each other and become much bigger so they can appear to be in different shapes and they can actually create structures. This section is 15-dimensional.
Cheese Section
[
]
This section is made entirely out of cheese. You can eat the cheese, too, and it smells like cheese. There are some weird blobs that live on this that eat the cheese, though. You can use the cheese to make cheese houses, and there is gas cheese in the air. There are lots of types of cheese, such as:
Mozzarella cheese
Swiss cheese
Blue cheese
Cheddar cheese
Fresh cheese
Aged fresh cheese
Semi-soft cheese
Really dense cheese
Cheese that doesn't actually exist
There are also cheese huts that are naturally formed and they have holes in them so you can get in and out of them. The terrain is really bumpy and mountainous so there are lots of things to do.
Also, there is a weird property that allows cheese to be infinitely generated if it is removed, so you can take some cheese out and then cheese will be generated to fill it in, so there is an infinite amount of cheese in this section.
For this reason, there was a big competition held at this section that had 34 million living things in it, which is the most living things that the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg has had ever. The goal was to make the tallest cheese tower. However, physics are weird in this section and you don't have to make a wide base, you just need to place all the cheese on top of each other. The tallest cheese tower ended up being so tall it escaped the gravity of the Sphere and started being weightless but the creator of it still kept going and it eventually reached the eggshell of the egg. Now, there is just a giant cheese tower that exists. The rest of the cheese towers made by competitors were just taken down but this one stayed because of how long it took to create.
However, the Sphere is stationary, so this tower hasn't affected it or its gravity because the cheese isn't actually part of the Sphere's material or gravity, only the iron in the core is. This section is 3-dimensional.
Mishmash Section
[
]
This section is basically a mishmash of everything. Sometimes you see different dimensions or completely different things out of nowhere and all of the physics laws are random and can change. Sometimes you get
Metrium
and then there's a big wide car next to it and then you hear random sounds and then you get flung to a mini version of a planet.
It works because there is a core in the middle of this section that randomly picks literally anything inside
The Box
(a thing, concept, law of reality, or something else) and duplicating it and placing it somewhere in this section. It uses a modified version of radio waves to send data to the object, which receives all of that object's data, and then it takes that data and places it somewhere in this section. Sometimes, different data will combine together, and create something else with mixed properties between two other data chunks.
Be careful, it is very easy to die or get injured in this section. However, it cannot affect anything outside of it, it just scans the properties of them, so don't worry about that. This section's dimensionality can vary, and sometimes it can even be a dimensionality that doesn't exist yet and is completely new.
Steve Section
[
]
This section was artificially created by someone called Steve. Steve was just driving his car when suddenly he accidentally went into the wrong direction and then fell into a hole. Now he has to get out, but he broke his legs so he can't. All he has is this cube he brings with him that he got from the dollar store but it says "don't open" so he didn't open it but now he has no other option so he opened it and he got teleported to the realm of
The Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature
. Gosh darn it! Now he has to escape before the terrifying purple and chartreuse fractal creature kills him. But he broke his legs so he can't. So he had to stay there and move through space with his arms but luckily there was an air pump machine.
He took it and threw it at the terrifying purple and chartreuse fractal creature and he got teleported to a different place but Steve thought that he killed him so he left out a sigh of relief and rested on the air pump machine but he accidentally put his broken legs on there and the air pump went into him. He got blew up like a balloon and died but he also turned into a giant sphere that is around 100 light years wide.
He stayed there for a while until the terrifying purple and chartreuse fractal creature came back and saw it. This creature didn't think this thing was worth its time so it threw it off into the distance. However, this Steve section went into another portal and it teleported into the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg so now it's there. This section is 3-dimensional.
Lonely Section
[
]
This section is basically just a desert but it has a really futuristic place in the very middle of it with really good technology and well-manufactured products and shelters. It is possible to access it, but it is in the middle of a desert, so not many bother. This high-tech place is similar to human technology in 2715 so it is very good. The place was built by the same person who put iron in the middle of the Sphere, since they felt this section wasn't interesting enough compared to the other ones. However, it didn't take much effort because that person could just build whatever they wanted by thinking about it because they just have that ability. It currently has a population of 2500 things so it is a pretty well-controlled place.
The futuristic place has a few different districts to divide some of the living things in it from others, but there are a few bridges you can use to get to a different one to visit it. The civilization in here doesn't actually know that they live inside an egg, but they often joke about living inside an egg because they have a weird memory inside their heads of it, they just don't believe it because they find it absurd. Also, anyone who went outside to go through the desert was never seen again. This includes one of the most popular and well-known beings in the place. This section is 8-dimensional.
Cold Section
[
]
For a while, the Cold Section was not part of the Sphere, it just floated around it, but it eventually went into the Sphere. It is red but it is also very cold, it is -268 degrees celsius on average but some parts have different physics laws so they go below -273 degrees celsius. Therefore, the only things that live in this are very hot things or very tough things, so most of them are around 1 meter tall. There is very noticeable mist and fog, though. Also, there are a lot of structures that the things in this section made, but most of them aren't shelter, they're just cool things. The most well received structure was the obstacle course made by Tdhdhfrurefhnsduieeqw which is very long. Tdhdhfrurefhnsduieeqw also made a heater which was good. This stuff only happened after the section joined into the Sphere. Before it joined it, practically nothing happened on this because it was too cold and it was also moving. This section is 7-dimensional.
Egg System
[
]
The Egg System is used to send eggs to the eggshell of the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg and it has four components.
Egg Generator
[
]
The Egg Generator
The Egg Generator is a thing located at the very top of the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg. It is mechanically powered and it generates different types of eggs randomly. These eggs don't really go anywhere as they travel through the Egg Tube. It generates
The giant egg
s,
The big egg
s,
The medium sized egg
s,
The small egg
s and
The tiny egg
s, but it generates each of them randomly.
They are created and stored in the black holes at the top of it, and they the randomizer picks which one to drop first. The egg is then dropped out of the hole at the bottom and then goes to the Egg Tube to travel to the Egg Receiver.
This machine also has an emergency shutoff switch at the back, but you have to solve a puzzle to get to it for security reasons. This will completely turn off the machine, but if it is turned off for too long, the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg might get damaged because the different types of eggs are essential for the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg's stability. More info about this will be provided in the Egg Receiver section.
Egg Tube
[
]
After the different types of eggs are created from the Egg Generator, they are sent off into the Egg tube to spiral down its winding path and eventually end up in the Egg Receiver to power the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg.
The Egg Tube is completely invisible and nothing can touch it except for the different types of eggs. However, if you are inside it, you might get bonked by an egg that rushes towards you, because the eggs are still visible and touchable, just not the tube.
The Egg Tube spirals a lot, so it is actually three times longer than the length of the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg. Therefore, it takes quite a long time for the eggs to reach the Egg Receiver which is at the bottom of the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg.
Egg Receiver
[
]
The Egg Receiver
The Egg Receiver is where the eggs end up after they go through the Egg Tube. Here, the eggs are stored, and there is a device that checks how much egg material the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg needs. Then, it picks the right egg, converts it into pure energy via a converting device, and then sends it into the egg shell of the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg.
The egg receiver is at the very bottom of the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg, and it simply looks like a hole. When eggs are put into the Egg Receiver, they need to be converted to pure energy. This is done by taking the mass of the egg and completely removing it, so all that is left is the energy. Then, it is put into the eggshell.
The eggshell needs these eggs to stay stable because its magnetism is actually temporary and kept around by the eggs that are put in. If there are no more eggs, the magnetism won't happen anymore. This will cause two problems. Firstly, the eggs will be much less attracted to the eggshell and they might just fall off. Also, there won't be an automatic crack removing bond, so the eggshell could be broken very easily, which would completely ruin the entire egg. If the egg compartment is full, then half of the eggs, chosen randomly, will exit into the Extension Tube.
Extension Tube
[
]
The Extension Tube is much shorter than the Egg Tube and it simply takes the unnecessary eggs back to the Egg Generator. This happens to clear up space while also avoiding putting too much energy into the eggshell. They will be sent back to the Egg Generator because the Egg Generator has much more space in it. So far, even with the Extension Tube trips, the Egg Generator hasn't had even 10% of it's compartment filled with eggs, so it won't be full anytime soon.
Nullification System
[
]
If the eggs that went through this system were just regular giant eggs,
big eggs
,
medium sized eggs
,
small eggs
and
tiny eggs
, this Egg System would not work properly because of the amount of strange stuff in these different types of eggs, such as the magnetic properties and the random things that exist in them. However, the Nullification System will basically turn all of the matter in these eggs into the same material as the eggshell, so the energy is still the same, but there won't be any magnetism. These systems are hidden in the Egg Tube.
However, the Nullification System never reaches the giant eggs that are stuck to the eggshell of the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg since they aren't part of the Egg System and aren't used to give energy to the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg's eggshell. Therefore, the giant eggs and the other types of eggs inside them will remain the same as they usually are.
The Thing
[
]
There is a floating thing somewhere in the FRICKIN GINORMOUS egg that is around 3 centimeters wide. Nobody knows why, it's just there.
