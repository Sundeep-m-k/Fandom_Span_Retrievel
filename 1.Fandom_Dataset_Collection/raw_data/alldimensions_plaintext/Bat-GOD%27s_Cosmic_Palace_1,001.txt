The
Bat-God's Cosmic Palace 1,001
is a cosmic palace for
The Bat-GOD
, whenever he wants to invite other cosmic entities or members of his celestial species, and he tends to make the palace more impressive for any cosmic entities like
Alphasm
, any beings as powerful, to show he truly is a more powerful entity than any
Alphasm
. He has a manifestation at his location and several other locations at any given time usually, sometimes he wants his full essence to manifest to accomplish a difficult task or to "show off." There are many palaces around the void, and The Bat-GOD has taken his prisoners to visit them before imprisonment, like

in order to have him understand the gravity of the situation they have put themselves into and what they have done. The Palace does not usually accommodate non cosmic guests however it has done so on occasion.
