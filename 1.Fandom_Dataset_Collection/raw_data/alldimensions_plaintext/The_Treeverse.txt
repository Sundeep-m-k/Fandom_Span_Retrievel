Treeverses
are large orbs which have multiple layers of Forests separated by grassy patches which are very small compared to Forests. Treeverses most resemble a planets, however there are multiple hollow orbs of dirt around each other with aforementioned grass and forests. There is about 50 Tree's hight between orbs These orbs go infinitely until they only fit one Forest.
The dirt in Treeverses is very healthy and has tons of stabilizing energy for The Forest's Trees to absorb and distribute across everything. This energy is constantly being regenerated by the dirt as well, although it is going slightly more slowly then at the beginning of Alphasm's imaginative spurt. Aside from that small and implicitavely worrying detail, the dirt is also very high in regular plant nutrients.
Another aspect of the Treeverse is its regular-sized planets within the hollow orbs between the dirt layers. These planets are rather warm and have plant based life of all varieties
excluding
trees. Berry bushes of all species, many found only here, and ferns with nearby grasses so soft they can be used for stuffed animals. Plants like these can be on the planets found here, as well as many, many more.
