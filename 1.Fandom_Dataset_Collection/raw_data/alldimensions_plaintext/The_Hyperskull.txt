Power?
Destroying anything smaller than it
The
Hyperskull
is an entity that rules over everything smaller than it. It can destroy practically anything smaller than it too, except some extremely small particles (like
Tiniest
or
Heck
). The pure size of this entity is enough to indicate how truly powerful it actually is.
This entity grows Ω times larger every -Ω
Voidseconds
, which is even more insane considering this entity has existed for Ω Voidenniums (A Voidennium is Ω years). It is the true largest entity and possibly the largest thing in existence.
No entity’s size can compare to the Hyperskull’s size. If the Hyperskull keeps growing like this, it may eventually grow larger than the
Wikiverse
itself. This is an extreme danger, as this means the Hyperskull will be able to roam free in the
FANDOMverse
and destroy other Wikiverses. Fortunately, this won’t happen for a ridiculous amount of time, or may not happen at all due to the possibility the skull may die of old age.
