Sixs
("
Baf
" in
The Pencil Language
or
Ect
in Future English) are the 6th verses in the
One Chain
, and they're also the 4th biggest one on it. These are the only verses in the chain to be inaccessible, and the only way to learn about them is to send light waves or other forms of electromagnetic waves to them, and use a sort of 'echolocation' to determine where objects are and what they are made out of.
Somehow, Sixs cannot be entered from their local
Seven
.
Appearance
[
]
Sixs appear to be black spheres, and much resembles many of the other verses in the One Chain. However, when looking from the inside of a Six, they appear to have an extremely bright interior. The case for this is still unknown.
Structure
[
]
The structure of a Six is mostly unknown, but creatures have proved that they consist of mostly point-like particles that contain
Glitchonicite
. Further research on them also determined that Sixs have millions, possibly billions, of black holes inside them.
It is also believed that six
Fives
reside inside of each Six. However, even the existence of Fives is still debated, so it is unknown whether this notion is true.
