The
Miiverse
was the verse where the
Mii Channel
takes place in.
It was spawned on January 26, 2012 (3DS) and November 28, 2012 (Wii U), April 24, 2013 (Internet).
It was annihilated on November 7, 2017, Nintendo's official statement on this decision was: "We decided to end the service at this time because, among other reasons, many users are shifting to social networking services".
However, the true story is that the amounts of stupidity within the Miiverse were getting so indescribably vast, that the dimension could no longer contain it and it would eventually spill out, causing irreversible rifts in spacetime which would lead to severe damage to at least 90% of
Verses
, including the Szechuanverse, the
OMGahhhhhverse
and Brazil (country). To prevent this massive existential disaster, Satoru Iwata rose from the grave and destroyed the Miiverse using an array of charged Septendecapetadakons ripped straight from
The Void
. The so-called Miiverse archive is merely an illusory copy implanted into the brains of former users of this Verse.
