Info
[
]
The Quincubeverse has a nesting of two cubes, one of those cubes has a quadcubeverse and the other has a cube inside of it (the cube is not a verse), but sometimes the cube is a verse, a tricubeverse. So it has a Nest notation of [2(1,1)].

Orbitcubes

A orbit cube is a cube inside the
Hexacubeverse
that holds the orbits of Quadcubeverses and Tricubeverses.

That means the nesting of the orbitcube is [2(1,(2(1,1)))].
