The
Fronq
(IPA: ['fɹↄ̃ŋk]), natively known by its
inhabitants
as "Zhēmawēlōyang" (IPA: /'ʒe:mawe:lo:jaŋ/), is the first verse in Class 30, the prepenultimate class in
The Extended Post-Hierarchy
, containing the
Fake Networkverse Ultracontainer
, the last verse in Class 29, and is contained by the
Multifronq
. It is ruled over by a
celestial frog-like entity
with (pretty much) the same name who is apparently stronger than
The Almighty
and is worshipped by many
fronqians
living in it. There is only 1 Fronq known to exist, simply known as the Fronq.
Structure
[

WIP
Another image of the Fronq.
The structure of the fronq is unique compared to other verses in that it has maze-like structures containing
Fake Networkverse Containers
attached to other ones located in large rooms, which are used to distribute resources to verses that are corrupted or dying.
