Darkest Matter is a more powerful form of Dark Matter. Its main purpose is to Guide the Universes to where they need to go and prevent new Big Bangs from destroying other Universes.
Darkest Matter is formed when clumps of Dark Matter scatter outside the Universe and get squished so tightly packed that it forms into Darkest Matter.
Since it is so tightly packed, it has the power to shape Universes Into Cosmic Beings or Darkest Matter itself.
