The
Kvmvvkaawiverse
is a very big type of verse that is also extremely cold. It is very hard to travel from a verse to another in this verse due to all of the floating orbs that will kill anything they touch, making it a very empty and cold verse besides the areas where
Nmklefvbverses
are located at. There is also no natural light in it outside of a few verses. The civilizations in this verse also hide themselves from Gronk.
