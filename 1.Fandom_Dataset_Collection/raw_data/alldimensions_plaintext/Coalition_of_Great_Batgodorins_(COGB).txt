The Coalition of Great
Batgodorins
(COGB) is a well-known, respected and mostly secretive organization founded by
Zatronos Zeldtro
,
Batlon Maxaon
, and
Vilabat Gortoso
. The Coalition has been dedicated to advancing their civilization and to make the members gain cosmic entity level influence and power just like
Batgodor
. Known Members of the Coalition are
Zatronos Zeldtro
,
Batlon Maxaon
,
Vilabat Gortoso
,
Dalonat Xanados
,
Batgodos Batgodoro
, and
Talabat Toronto
. More members are rumored to be a part of the coalition or have been forcibly removed from the coalition by higher up members like
Zatronos Zeldtro
,
Vilabat Gortoso
, and
Batlon Maxaon
.  Even
Bat like cosmic entities
such as
Batros
and
The Bat-GOD
do not know their true intentions, with
Batgodor
not even knowing they exist as a coalition nor their objectives. The coalition has locations in the cities of
Batgodorton
and
Zatronoville
which are major cities of the planet and the most populated. This Coalition has also had an interest in travelling to other verses and planets beyond their own planet of
Batgodori
.  One planet in particular they want to visit is
Betasm-Alphasm-Oni Megacity-Planet
, as well as others across the verses. We are collaborating with
The Jamie Secret Alliance
to destroy the Quack Quack Duck Society.
