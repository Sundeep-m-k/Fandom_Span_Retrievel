AHHHH!!!!!!!!!
is the Trans-Universe that is beyond
Ummmm.........
. AHHHH!!!!!!!!! recieves this name as a quote someone may say when trying to comprehend AHHHH!!!!!!!!! and also the near polar opposite of Ummmm......... . Trying to even teorize this universe drove the best scientists crazy, giving a third reason why this is called AHHHH!!!!!!!!! . Some facts scientists could work enough to figure out are:
Facts
Using the process of elementaradiatioparticulecollidation, they figured out why it looks like it does in the picture, an extreme overload of
Transcendium
(Element 751 on the periodic Table) causing the verse to be colored a shade of purplish-blue.
Scientists also figured out that the creatures that live in this verse have an average lifetime of
â„µ
9
{\displaystyle \aleph_9}
years. The reason why they live this long is because of an anti aging chemical in their body with the formula of
Ts
2
Tx
5
Ro
57
{\displaystyle \ce{Ts2Tx5Ro57}}
, which indicates a mixture of
Transcendium
(Ts),
Toxicium
(Tx), and
Rossonium
(Ro). Rossonium gives the main anti aging reaction, Toxicium is what they need to survive, and Transcendium connects them to AHHHH!!!!!!!!! forever so they only become non existent when the verse does.
Note: Anyone can edit this page if they want but ONLY by adding a bigger verse that contains AHHHH!!!!!!!!! or adding new facts.
