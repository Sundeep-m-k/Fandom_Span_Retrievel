Life
[
]
The Life on the Omni-Surface comes in many forms, such as
Omni-Plants
,
Omni-Mammals
,
Omni-Birds
,
Omni-Fish
,Omni-Reptiles
, and
Omni-Amphibians
.  For example,
Omni-Trees
Are each a living thing, all being TransTransTransTransPanOmni gods.  Every single creature or object on the Omni-Surface represents some form of abstractness and emotion.  The strongest of these abstracts are the
Omni-Humans
.
Humans
[
]
Omni-Humans Are the most powerful abstract ever.  What they represent is not just a single object or thought, but the entirety of relativity and existence.  Omni-Humans have made Omni-Nukes Before, which one time destroyed one of
The Omni-Caves
and ended all life that could've been thriving in there.  In fact, it destroyed
The Omni-Cave
Right next to us, called "The Triumphant Catacombs". (Our local one is called "The Hypothetical Catacombs).  In fact, the only way this photo was taken is because of the Omni-Humans wanting a "Pretty Picture" to hang up in their
Omni-House
.
