The cosmic tree frog is a female white tree frog with a massive size of 344 gigaparsecs. She is 230 billion years old. Her behavior indicates she is protecting any universe in the WSP-01 universe cluster, along with the life inside them; it is unknown why, but it is a blessing. The frog is theorized to be indestructible and was strong enough to ward off a cosmic invasion of 272 billion advanced alien troops. She is known to eat invaders and cosmic fruit flies. She is able to swim in the space between universes like water or jump from universe to universe. She is able to change the consistency of the void between universes for herself at will; this does not change the viscosity for other beings.
