About
[
]
The
virtual Omniverses
are the 2nd largest type of
verse
in the
virtual
chain
. They are created from
non-existing
virtual
particles
, which in turn are created from the
Xanmeverses
because of their non-existing
voids
. They also link the
Mandelbrothverses
within them.
The lifetime of any
virtual Archverse
is of around 16.3 yoctoseconds, after which they then explode as chaos particles and
virtual particles
that create similar Archverses. Example: if a virtual Omniverse dies, it then creates another one as a replacement. Same applies for other virtual Archverses.
Weird laws of physics
[
]
If you live in a virtual Archverse, the time perception is almost null, as every 0.000012 yoctoseconds usually feels like
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
seconds. Anything touching a virtual Omniverse that is of a smaller size gets teleported in a parallel
Universe
in a virtual Archverses chain.
Virtual Omniverse can be created in a
Metaverse
just for having online cyber-archverses that contain a game Universe. The only difference of virtual Omniverse that is in a Metaverse, is that they have an infinite lifetime.
Creation of virtual Omniverses
[
]
A structure known as a virtual core, after releasing all of its energy, ends up splitting into 5 non-existing chaos particles and 50 non-existing virtual particles that are creating even more virtual cores. Every virtual core is a chain of virtual Archverses itself. When there is aproximately
10
632
{\displaystyle 10^{632}}
virtual Archverses, the energy released from every one of these Archverses makes a virtual Omniverse. If only 1 virtual Archverse dies, their entire Omniverse dies too as a consequence. It's thanks to that, as to why their lifetime is so small.
