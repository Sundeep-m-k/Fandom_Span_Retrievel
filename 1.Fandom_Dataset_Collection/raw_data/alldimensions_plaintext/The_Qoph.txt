Powerful centrifugal force
The Qoph
is a structure sustained by centrifugal force located in an undefined location next to the border of the Observable
Universe
.
Accessing the Qoph
[
]
In order to access the Qoph, one must travel 100 billion light years in the constant direction 138°W, 42°N. There, one must detect a strong centrifugal force. This object will be the relatively small Qoph, a circular object with a line pointing in the direction of the Observable Universe. There is also a way to access it for 4-dimensional beings, which will land them in the center of the Qoph. This would generate so much potential energy, that any being will be ejected to the side.
Exiting the Qoph
[
]
To exit the Qoph, one must predict when the centrifugal force becomes weakest, something that happens when one passes the exiting line. This requires a lot of precision and self-control, and entities can get stuck for months, years and even decades inside the Qoph.
