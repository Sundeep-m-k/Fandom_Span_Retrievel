MLG memes and random words, other stuff too
The
Spamverse
is a very weird
verse
which is extremely oversaturated by MLG memes and random words.
Somehow, the amount of bytes of this page is enormous, despite its short length (Check revision history). Why such a thing is taking place in here? No one knows...
Just check the infobox. See any spam? No, there's just something else which is wrong...
The sheer density of this
page
also applies to the verse itself. The fact it didn't collapse into a
black hole
is an insane feat for it, in fact. spam
