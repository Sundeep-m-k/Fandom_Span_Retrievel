The
⎋⎋⎋⎋⎋verse
is an isolated verse which contains nothing but exactly 9,099 statues of the symbol ⎋

. It was discovered using the
Anti-Isolationist's telescope
, a type of telescope which, through unknown means, can show normally isolated verses, and also give very detailed information about said verse.
Many, but not all of the qualities of the ⎋⎋⎋⎋verse are based on the number 9,099. In hexadecimal, 9,099 becomes 238b, which is the unicode code point of the ⎋ symbol. Qualities based on 9,099 include the size, dimensionality, temperature, shape, things within, and density/void percentage.
The ⎋ Statues
[
]
The ⎋ statues themselves have been found to be made with Bcwnaium, the 9,099th element. They are also 2 dimensional, being shaped like the symbol ⎋, giving it its name. No further information will be provided.
Exploration Log
[
]
There has been a singular exploration into the ⎋⎋⎋⎋⎋verse, and due ti the events that happened in the duration of the exploration, no more explorations shall be attempted or supported.
The One and Only Exploration Log

0:00 AE

]
: The space surrounding the ⎋⎋⎋⎋⎋verse is entered. It appears to be a void, with no verses in sight.
1:02 AE
: After some time, the ⎋⎋⎋⎋⎋verse is spotted by the crew. They proceed towards it.
3:04 AE.
3:04 AE
: The crew approach the ⎋⎋⎋⎋⎋verse, and a closeup is gotten of it.
3:13 AE
: The crew notice that the ⎋⎋⎋⎋⎋verse appears to be solid, so they open a wormhole from the outside to the inside.
3:17 AE
: The wormhole is entered, which reveals many ⎋ statues.
3:28 AE
: The crew go around the ⎋⎋⎋⎋⎋verse, showing all of the different ⎋ statues.
4:32 AE
: A ship wreckage very similar to the one being used for the exploration is noticed. 90.99% of the crew enter a trance-like state upon seeing the wreckage

9:09 AE

: The feeds come back. The outside cameras now show nothing, and the inside cameras show ⎋ statues roaming the halls, a red light continually flashing, and three distinct male voices

repeat the phrases "238B", "Broken circle with northwest arrow," and a sound that is described by listeners as sounding like the symbol ⎋. During this time, the ⎋⎋⎋⎋⎋verse was unobservable with the Anti-Isolationist's Telescope and unable to be entered. Exactly 9,099 minutes later, the feeds cut out again.
The craft and all crew are to be considered lost.

The 90.99% were originally planned for the mission, but the remaining 9.01% were not, and were last-minute.

Note by researcher: This should've been impossible, but that's apparently what the in-craft cameras said. It was stuck like that too.

They appear to be coming from the ⎋ statues.
