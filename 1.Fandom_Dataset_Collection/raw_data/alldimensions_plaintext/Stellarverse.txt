Unlike the
Compaverse
this universe holds the
compaverses
. The stellarverse resembles a shield or a triangle (mostly triangle)
The stellarverse is a massive place containing trillions of
compaverses
these compaverses are not tightly packed together actually they are very spaced apart.
Creation
[
]
The Stellarverse was created from plasma, gas and dark matter. The materials that created the universe where in the area next to Stellarverse. Overtime it started to form due to gravitational forces it was given a triangular shape. (More info later)

One of these civilizations whose name Eternia who rules their home compaverse their home is covered with a massive shield to protect them from enemy civilizations. There are many other stronger civilizations in the stellarverse but that is the strongest one that we know of. most of these civilizations never leave their home compaverse unless if there is a war happening.

The outside is the area around the Stellarverse, the Stellarverse is located in the middle of the disk. The disk measures around 500 trillion light years. Outside of the region are stars and other universes like the Stellarverse since the disk around it is there it is hard to know because of the disk.
