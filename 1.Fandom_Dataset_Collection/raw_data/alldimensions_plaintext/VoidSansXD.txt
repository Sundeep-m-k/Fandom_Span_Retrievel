VoidSansXD
is the most powerful
Transcendent Omni-God
that wasn't benefited with bureaucratic or administrative powers.  Her only weaknesses are the
Reverse Uno Card
, and even then it can't be used on her by non Transcendent Omni Gods, and even if they ARE one of those, it still won't really work for them as VoidSansXD always finds a way to win. The other weakness is being gnomed, an act that only BestNoobReborn can do. The rest of this article will show VoidSansXD's feats;

The Absolute Creator
immediately died of information overload just like

.
Other non-administrative and non-bureaucratic Transcendent Omni-Gods tried to team up and destroy VoidSansXD, but she just said "if u kil me ur mom gay" and since they tried to kill her, they turned gay and died of gay.
VoidSansXD outcringes Bureaucratic and Administrative Transcendent Omni-Gods by 100.
VoidSansXD vs Bureaucratic and Administrative Transcendent Omni-Gods
[
]
VoidSansXD can actually defeat the bureaucratic and administrativeTranscendent Omni-Gods, and relatively easily.
Case 1
[
]
She uses the other trick, and the bureaucratic and administrative Transcendent Omni-Gods use a
Reverse Uno Card
, but since VoidSansXD knows
Googology
and definitely no one else does, she uses Reverse Uno Card x
Epsilon Nought
, causing the bureaucratic and administrative Transcendent Omni-Gods to die of epsilon nought gay.
Case 2
[
]
VoidSansXD gets into a fist fight with the bureaucratic and administrative Transcendent Omni-Gods and loses because they're overweight and weak.
Case 3
[
]
VoidSansXD wins by epicly 360 noscoping the bureaucratic and administrative Transcendent Omni-Gods!!!!!!
Case 4
[
]
Case 1, but the bureaucratic and administrative Transcendent Omni-Gods know googology and use cantor's absolute infinity
Reverse Uno Card
, resulting in VoidSansXD immediately dying.
Case 5
[
]
VoidSansXD uses overused dead memes that are extremely cringe and results in the bureaucratic and administrative Transcendent Omni God's death by cringe.
Case 6
[
]
MinersHavenM43
and VoidSansXD try to outcringe eachother for eternity, resulting in a tie.
Case 7
[
]
BestNoobReborn infinitely gnomes VoidSansXD causing VoidSansXD to die of being gnomed. (not administrative/bureaucratic, only basic.)
Case 8
[
]
BestNoobReborn tries to infinitely gnome VoidSansXD, but VoidSansXD's cringy dead memes overwhelm the gnomes resulting in the death of the almight gnome.
Case 9
[
]
VoidSansXD somehow kills the entire microsoft company in dead memes, resulting in her gaining the ultimate Transcendent Omni-God role. GIRLS ARE SO HOT!!
Case 10
[
]
VoidSansXD fights
Ubersketch
by shooting cringe projectiles at him, but
Ubersketch
fights back and stuns VoidSansXD with an extremely offensive insult, and
Ubersketch wins
.
Case 11
[
]
VoidSansXD fights
Ubersketch
, and the latter insults VoidSansXD, so VoidSansXD retalliates by epicly hitting a dab, resulting in
Ubersketch
dying of pure cringe.
Case 12
[
]
The Megalo of all Omni-Destroyers
tries to destroy VoidSansXD, but VoidSansXD's cringe level completely destroyed them with dead memes.
Case 13
[
]
ICantEdit and the rest of the administrative/bureaucratic Transcendent Omni-Gods ate VoidSansXD, but then VoidSansXD pulled out a Reverse Uno Card and ate them instead, resulting in the death of all of the powers greater than VoidSansXD.
Case 14
[
]
ICantEdit and the rest of the administrative Transcendent Omni-Gods stabbed VoidSansXD with a
Pencil
for about TREE(3) times, and VoidSansXD got stunned. Then, ICantEdit drew TREE(3)
Logical Terminators
using that Pencil, and told them to attack VoidSansXD. VoidSansXD destroyed many of them with her cringy memes, but she eventually got knocked over, and all other transcendent omni-gods shot their most powerful weapons at VoidSansXD all at once.  VoidSansXD was beaten, but just barely.  Many bureaucratic and administrative Transcendent Omni-Gods died that day.
Case 15
[
]
RU66 kills himself before VoidSansXD gets close to him.
Best case scenario: Every single Transcendent Omni-God teams up to destroy me and barely win.
Case 16
[
]
VoidSansXD breaks into
Unnamed2019
's New Beyond Universe Wiki. Link below:
https://new-beyond-universe.fandom.com/wiki/User:Unnamed2019
