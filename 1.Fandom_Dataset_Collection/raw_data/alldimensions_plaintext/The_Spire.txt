The Spire
is a tower, it both contains and is contained by the fifth everything layer, this is because the fifth everything layer is wrapped around it in a spiral. The realm known as the first realm is postioned near the very top, and the realm known as the 15th realm is actually the realm closest to the top. The properties of the realms it contains do follow a strict pattern in the way that their properties change depending on where they are on the spire, but it is so complex that it can only be comprehended by some of the most powerful enteties of the fourth everything layer. Using this pattern, it has been accurately calculated what realms are stable and may be possible to interact with. Needlessly destroying The Spire will get you killed by one of the seven Spirals.
Spirals are powerful cosmic entities that protect The Spire from great harm. Scyther, Melico, and I-ron are the names of three known Spirals. The other four Spirals have decided to keep their names a secret.
