on average
An
ERRORverse
(also known as
Errorverses
) is a type of
verse
that contains multiple
NULLverses
.
They have way more errors than the latters, hence the name. Those glitches are (almost) enough to notice their weirdness. The bubbles of these verses are too
glitchy
to work properly, which can be seen in the infobox's image. They often collide with each other, which causes them to expand or shrink, change to different colors, etc.
Effects to
Fake Pageverses
[
]
Even though they are corrupted, they never make such a significant error on a Fake Pageverse's scale compared to what they do to themselves. Some of the effects that DO happen are when a few letters or words in the Fake Pageveres act strange. Even their templates can get a little corrupted when there are some inconsistencies around. A category may also get jumbled in alphabetical order with the titles of pages for a little bit.
Destroying ERRORverses
[
]
Aka the ERRORverse uncorruption, this is how the ERRORverses' errors simply stop existing, this isn't good though because they build up larger verses and without them, they might be destroyed as well.
This can be done without destroying the larger verses by making
Ëŕŗōřverse
large enough to get less glitchy, using Anti-NULLverses to fight over normal NULLverses, weakening extreme
glitchonicites
using the
entities
that exist here and fixing specific parts of the ERRORverses.
Anti-NULLverses aren't really what the name implies for, so they are useful in this situation. They lack glitchonicites to fight those universes. This can only be done if the non-glitchy Ëŕŗōřverses don't work.
Fixing some parts isn't necessarily going to make them stable either. Only the glitchiest parts are the ones that need to be fixed. Usually, the near left-bottom corner of the ERRORverses will cancel their errors while the ones near right-top corner may make the laws and constants the same in all the NULLverses. If the latters don't have the same laws and constants inside themselves, it will cause corruptions in their local ERRORverse.
There aren't even any rogue
voids
in them, which makes them less unstable. The voids grow bigger the more matter they loose, but sometimes some matter can be present from other ERRORverses. This is nearly impossible to do for now because they will still get glitchy even after fixing everything. Even if they have voids, it doesn't last for long. The only way to properly fix everything is to permanently change glitchonicites to other, more stable elements and yet we and the entities can't do this and unknown chemical reactions must take place in order to happen.
