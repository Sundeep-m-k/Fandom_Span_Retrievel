Dak
" in Future English) are strange
Number
verses
sandwiched between the 2
Hierarchical Tunnels
that are the
Eleven
and
One
Chains
.
Appearance
[
]
Due to how both
Nines
and
Nineteens
are basically impossible to escape, it is impossible to escape the Hierarchical Tunnels of the One and Eleven Chain to take a look at Tens. However, they're presumed to look like an
universe
due to what an
Alphasm
said about them.
Structure
[
]
Tens have an unknown structure due to their inaccessibility. Alphasms or any of the other
Class 0 gods
have not confirmed what lies inside of a Ten, and it is unknown whether the information will ever be disclosed.
