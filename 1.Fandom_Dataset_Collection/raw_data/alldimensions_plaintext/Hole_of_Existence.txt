The
Hole of Existence
is a hole which contains Everything which exists in reality. Even the most scientific scientists can't find an explanation. This page is known as a Editor Chain, which means people like Me, Idontknow, BestNoobReborn, YellowMarkers1, and a lot of other people can edit the page. Let's start with the Template. Ah yes, the classic template!

What Does It Feel Like?
[
]
It feels like your in a volcano, or a tornado. Actually both. With the power of surviving, you can get out by teleporting by the Teleport Button. It spawns in your hands, when you get in. With all of that , you can control the hole by your mind. There's also a Green Lava Village called Mojjaowuiweyjeieueidiodidjdodjdidididkdkodidididjdjdjdjkdodjdh here. It's harder to breathe here than on Earth, so be careful, even though you can survive WITHOUT breathing!
Why an Editor Chain?
[
]
Why should I survive 5 minutes of deleting pages like mine? Why not sneak users into it! Like Idontknow for example, and other good editors.
Idontknow message: Bruh, im not a good editor.
And now, THE INFORMATION!
[
]
With it having π∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞ verses, ITS CRAZY! Like, the ¿¡…"'£verse. Which is OWNED BY THIS HOLE. For more information: Check out G^150.

(Size Math on top of the page) (I failed to do Size Math because Fandom can't read it.)
The hole is not big enough to surpass the Galaxy Cluster, which is veryyyyyy long.

Martin: THIS IS SOMETHING I CAN DESTROY BY REVERSE ACTION №1!
Me: uhhhhhhhh, It's so big… Even Bongus cannot eat it!
Martin: WHY DO I FAIL ALL DAY LONG TO DEFEAT THIS STUPID HOLE!
NoJvof: Well, not everything is destroyable.
Martin: LOL WHAT
NoJvof: Your ‱℟〠 action can't.
Martin: ALRIGHT IT WORKS. SAME WITH YOUR DUMB CLUSTER.
NoJvof: 2+2=4
Martin: ITS 7595849!
NoJvof: The 2+2=5 joke is already getting old.
Martin: I can change 2+2 to any number without having to worry.
NoJvof: Still more powerful.
Martin:
Okay, that's cool and all, but show me literally one person who asked. *destroys it anyway, then restores it*
No jvof: Who cares, we are both random stupid EABAs.
Martin: hmm... good point!
