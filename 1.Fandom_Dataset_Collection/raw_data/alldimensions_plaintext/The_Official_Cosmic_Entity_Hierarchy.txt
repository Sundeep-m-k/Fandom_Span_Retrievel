"Who actually reads these?" - fish (2023)
This cool page is meant to be a hierarchy for all the
Cosmic entities
on the
AD wiki
. The weakest entities are listed at the top, while the strongest ones being at the bottom. Each group of Cosmic entities are divided into their own classes as well. Please Note That Anything Past
Oblivion
is UNOFFICIAL.
LEGEND:
(?) (space after name) = Have a questionable place in the hierarchy, and might be moved soon.
(X) (space after name) = Have been killed/destroyed
(JAILED) (space after name) = Have been imprisoned, or at least stuck in a small space. This could be either imprisoned by other cosmic entities, or because they are trapped from the beginning.
[C] (space after name) = TOG contradictory, see
Transcendent Omni-Gods
[R] (space after name) = Being rewritten

Nigh-Ultimate
[
]
Nigh-Ultimate is nowhere near Ultimate level, as can be clearly seen by the fact the level of Ultimate is totally inaccessible from below partly due to Natu. Likewise every level above this point is even more inaccessible than the previous inaccessibility. However it is long before this point, in the class systems in fact, that inaccessibility is surpassed entirely. Therefore this term from here on is only used for simplicity.

[
]
Note the gap between Orgasm and nigh-ultimate tier compared to Ultimate tier is monstrous, and is even more absurd than trying to compare
True Nothing
to any transfinite arbitrary meta class terminator. imagine a class system, where regular classes are 0, meta classes are 1, etc. with the number referring to the greatest entry of any example of such class. say we have an excessively large transfinite number of classes (0), and the largest metanumber of meta classes.

2 would be beyond numbers and any extension of the concept, etc. and that we then reach system
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
. you may think this is the lower bound of an ultimate entity, but the system they would be in is beyond count and any extension of this idea. that, like anything scriptable, is an immensely vast understatement of the actual power of an ultimate entity. They are beyond tiers, and any terminology. If an entity can be categorized in any way, ultimates are beyond it. If it can be compared to something else, ultimates are probably > it. U > E > X, and U > X > E. Ultimates are basically the greatest end all be all. This is not a term to apply to entities lightly, as it is the most powerful classification of characters that currently exists, and is potentially the most powerful type of character possible. These are far beyond any god mode, joke battle character, gag power, etc. We probably wont have verses for this tier any time soon. Anything in this tier is likely the most powerful thing in the history of fiction. It is indescribably OP. Entities here are on the Ԫ and ÇX scales.

There is no threshold for ultimate beings due to the fact we don't have verses on the wiki to compare it to yet. Everything currently existing is too small. Ultimate entities are beyond any description, idea, class system, systems in general, and every other term.

we have some leeway with numbers here because of how little they matter at this point

To be as powerful as this god you have to... THERE IS NO WAY TO GET THIS POWERFUL FROM BELOW!

this category is only for the badly translated entities, because their strengths can differ when badly translated.
