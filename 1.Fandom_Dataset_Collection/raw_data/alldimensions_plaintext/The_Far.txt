Appearance
[
]
The Far appears to be a huge, vast complex filled with new stars, artificial superstructures, nebulae, galaxies, and many more equally dazzling things. The Far is full of color, with aqua blue and magenta being the main colors.
Structure
[
]
The structure of The Far is mostly unknown, but many creatures have reported it having an infinite amount of nested levels, each with huge superstructures, stars, and nebulae.
Stars
[
]
The stars in The Far are one of the biggest stars ever found. They have been found to be transfinitely wide, and they give off ridiculous amounts of energy. The life in The Far has used huge energy harvesters to get a lot of energy to power their superstructures and machines. This type of star has an almost pure white color, and has been denoted as a Class Ñ star.
Nebulae
[
]
The nebulae in The Far are way more efficient than normal nebulae in normal verses. However, The Far is NOT a normal verse. These nebulae can produce up to 3797 stars per
Yalmeon Time
, which is ridiculous.
There are 2 types of nebulae, and they come in 2 colors: aqua blue and magenta (just like in the picture). The aqua blue type always produces smaller but hotter stars, and the magenta type produces bigger but colder stars. Both types of nebulae produce at a similar rate, but the magenta type is a little bit slower. It only produces 2739 stars per
Yalmeon Time
, while its aqua blue counterpart produces 2893 stars per
Yalmeon Time
.
Galaxies
[
]
Some galaxies in The Far are also special. There are 6 types of galaxies.
The first type is a regular elliptical galaxy. This type is very similar to normal galaxies that can be found in
Our Universe
, such as the Andromeda Galaxy.
The second type are the spherical galaxies. These types are known to be extremely dense, and are way smaller than any of the other types. They usually give off huge amounts of deadly radiation, and they almost never host life.
The third type are the irregular galaxies. These galaxies can be found all over the cosmos, so they are not very interesting. However, the irregular galaxies in The Far have way more nebulae than any other type. The irregular galaxies are also bigger, usually 2.5x more.
The fourth type are the spiral galaxies. Again, these galaxies are quite common everywhere. The spiral galaxies are usually the ones to have the most life. Many spiral galaxies are also home to huge interversal trading hubs.
The fifth type of galaxy are the spread-out galaxies. These galaxies are the most rare, and only a few have been found by the life in The Far. The spread-out galaxies are obviously the least dense out of all the galaxies. These galaxies are kept in secure conditions by the life, due to their rarity.
The sixth and final type of galaxy is the virtual type. This type is usually kept in larger galaxies, and is protected extremely well. Most virtual galaxies have nothing in them, and are usually just for testing The Far's huge simulation complexes.
Most of the galaxies have many
Clusters
in them. The life in The Far have constantly tried to break inside, but all attempts to do so have failed due to the ridiculously strong barrier protecting the Clusters from outside threats.
Life
[
]
The life in The Far is extremely advanced and they have built huge superstructures, trading hubs, spacecraft, and many more things.
Desc.
[
]
The life in The Far resemble humanoid reptiles. They are extremely intelligent, and can most likely figure out the hardest math problems ever. They have 4 limbs (2 legs, 2 arms), but on each hand are 15 fingers (based on accounts from explorers). They also have scaly skin. The life has also proven to be extremely tough and strong. No name has been given to the life. A person called Poof called them the Descs because their explain everything.
Superstructures
[
]
There have been many superstructures constructed by the life in The Far. These superstructures are usually for the purpose of mining and extracting valuable materials or trading with other lifeforms.
Here are 3 famous superstructures.
Tgyiin
[
]
Tgyiin is a huge structure that is still in use. It is used for mining planets, and is one of the biggest superstructures. Tgyiin was first active in 2892 OYC, when the life needed materials to build another trading hub, since the previous one got destroyed by a huge rogue star. Tgyiin itself was built all the way back in 12 OYC. Tgyiin can mine whole Class Ñ stars in about 1280 Planck Times, and can mine planets even faster, at 59 Planck Times.
Qwytti
[
]
Qwytti was a famous trading hub built all the way back in -12 OYC. It was destroyed for unknown reasons in 203 OYC, most likely for resources. At its peak, Qwytti housed over 1 centillion creatures from all over The Far. Many important decisions were decided inside Qwytti, including the Rfghii Agreement (an agreement over different territories) and the Fllighen (the decision of whether to change the calendar).
Zfdawe
[
]
Zfdawe was a huge structure built in 2708 OYC, with many different portals that could take you almost everywhere in The Far. This structure was destroyed in 9023 OYC, when a glitch in the superstructure occurred, causing many creatures to use the portals to their advantage and glitch out of The Far to explore the rest of the cosmos. The leaders of The Far didn't want the creatures escaping, so they destroyed the superstructure and used the spare materials to build a huge sign that read in their native language, "Do not try to escape this place. It is not good." This was met with harsh resistance from the life, and a war broke out afterwards. Today in The Far, the events are known as "The Extremely Stupid War Over Pointless Things". Name's fitting.
Simulation Complexes
[
]
These huge structures are what house the 6th type of galaxy in The Far, the virtual galaxies. These structures usually use up ridiculous amounts of energy, so only a few run at a time. These structures are there to experiment with lower-level realities, and are also sometimes used as a form of entertainment. Some creatures have spoke out about the ethics of the Simulation Complexes, but almost all have been ignored.
