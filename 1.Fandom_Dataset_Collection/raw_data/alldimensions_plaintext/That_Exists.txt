"That Exists" is the sequel to the book
Everything
. It was deliberately meant to be zero meters in size, even though it still has information just like Everything.
It is located in the
2
Ï‰
{\displaystyle \frac{2}{\omega}}
th dimension, just like the first.
It is a very similar book to Everything, but it continues where it left off. This book is shorter than the previous one, being only 48 pages, but people seem to enjoy it just as much.
