made its two poles round.

Bottom of the Sky Tower
Creation
[
]
The Sky Tower was formed via white hole asteroids that crashed into the south pole as it was going down, meaning it was naturally formed over a few years. At first, it was a very irregular shape, but it slowly formed into a cylinder when the force caused by the pole formation grew stronger and the asteroids got hotter, so they collapsed into a cylinder shape. It didn't fall further because the physics in
in Silico
are not the same as in the universe, it just has forces and that's pretty much it.
After the Sky Tower was fully finished, it was left there for a bit, until a part of the south pole was propelled by one of
in Silico
's random force particles and it hit the bottom of the Sky Tower, and then it flattened into a strange island shape. Someone made it green and brown using matter colouring devices because they felt like doing it.
Simulations
[
]
The Sky Tower's primary purpose is to simulate things and predict what would happen in specific situations. This was not naturally formed, it was added to give the Sky Tower a purpose, since it otherwise didn't have much purpose and served as a weird verse with almost nothing in it.
You can input something into this simulation and it will simulate its entirety in real time, assuming the place you're simulating revolves around a linear time flow such as a linear
Coin
. Then, it is possible to alter the time of the currently simulated place, allowing you to visualize the past or predict the future with 99.62% accuracy (calculated using 100,003 total tests).
Mechanism
[
]
The simulations work because of two distinct technological components that are stored inside the top of the Sky Tower.
The machine
[
]
There is a machine that can computationally travel through time and gain data from the past or the future and send it back. It cannot change the flow of time, it can only view it. It takes all the visual data from the selected location and convert them into models that can be viewed by the Emulator.
Emulator
[
]
The Emulator takes the data gathered by the previous machine and creates a model by manipulating static untouchable particles from
in Silico
into the area and giving a detailed representation of what is happening, what has happened and what will happen. These particles are not light, but they are visible and easily manipulative by weird forces.
When the Emulator is not given a specific location to emulate, it defaults to showing a sky, which gave it the name of Sky Tower.

Other than the simulations, the Sky Tower doesn't have much else inside of it, other than typical cosmological objects. However, the objects tend to be simpler than usual, being made of abstract material or pure matter. There are lots of hyperspheres made of this stuff, and a few clusters of dust that form irregular shapes. There is also no temperature and no resources, so life cannot really happen here, which is why this verse was considered purposeless and was given an emulation service. However, the stuff inside the Sky Tower contains many colours that don't exist anywhere else, which has gained the attention of some living things, but it is usually a temporary spark of interest and it doesn't provide anything useful.
Bottom of the Sky Tower
[
]
The bottom of the Sky Tower has a bunch of small rock-like objects that don't have enough mass to be unaffected by the south pole's force, so they fell to the bottom. This is why there isn't anything small in the middle of the Sky Tower. The stuff at the bottom keep the Sky Tower stable and prevent it from falling over because it provides a solid foundation due to the fact that it is completely stationary relative to the south pole, so if the Sky Tower receives a force, it will be stopped by this pile of stuff because it can withstand the Sky Tower.
