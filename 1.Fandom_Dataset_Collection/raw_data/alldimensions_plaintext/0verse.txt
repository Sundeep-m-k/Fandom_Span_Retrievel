0verses are the transfictional equivalent to
protoverses
. For no reason, negative scale does not exist in transfictionality, and anything said to be transfictional with a negative scale is PreTF. They are the building blocks of all transfictional entities and objects, and are by far the biggest jump in all hierarchies so far, because of how small
The Ultimate Reality
is in comparison. This also begins a lot of hierarchal looping, where each subsequent loop goes 1 verse/object or step higher, until we have enough steps to reach the 0verse. Then it begins again, until you have the level of
The Meta-Box
in TF objects. Then it repeats until 0verse endlessly. After all the loops is the True 0verse, then the next verse in
The Meta-Hierarchy
with an actual page, which hasn't been created yet. The jump between a 0verse, or even a true 0verse, and the next verse in TMH is even larger than that of the one made from TUR to a True 0verse. These jumps are obviously way >quantifiability. True 0verses are contained by
Laccen.
