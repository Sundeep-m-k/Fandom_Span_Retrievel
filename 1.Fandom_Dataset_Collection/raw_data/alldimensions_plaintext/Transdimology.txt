How to represent a verse as a number (via ordinals)
[
]
Starting at a universe (which is 0), if a verse a contains verse b, then verse a has is the number after verse b. If verse a contains multiple verses, then verse a the number after the last verse it contains.
The opposite is done if verse a is contained within verse b.
If a verse goes beyond the transfinites, then is it considered A.

A+1 = A1

these systems work exactly the same as the A-system but with a different letter
