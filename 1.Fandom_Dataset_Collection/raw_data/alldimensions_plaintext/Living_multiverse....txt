The
living multiverse
is a variation of
multiverses
that contains
deepverses
and
voidtowns
. They're both a verse and a being at the same time, that being the reason of their given name. Our local living multiverse is a female.

Personality
[
]
Our living multiverse has either a "good" (happy) or "deep" (sad) mood. Depending on it, the structure of our living multiverse changes. When she's sad, more deepverses are generated and less blueverses are made. When she's happy, the opposite happens, with the blueverses being the ones made in mass instead.
Good mode
[
]
Everything is blue and beautiful, so it's nice to live here. Some kind of buildings form in areas with lack of contained verses. The average temperature is -30°C. There's no evil entities being generated during this time.
Deep mode
[
]
Everything is terrible and scary, the concept of temperature breaks down and evil and destructive entities are formed out of nowhere and on random areas.
History
[
]
Most of the time, living multiverses can only have 2 dominant moods which are formed in their childhoods. Ours developed the happy and sad ones, the latter appearing since she was bullied during her childhood by other living multiverses (somehow). She has the happy mood integrated since its a pretty common one bethween others of her kind, though "weirder" ones can appear like hate, madness or even lust, etc., with these ones affecting their structures and behaviors in different ways.
