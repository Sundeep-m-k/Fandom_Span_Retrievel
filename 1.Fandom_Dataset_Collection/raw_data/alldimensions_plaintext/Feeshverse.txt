The

is a large
EDA
, and the last, at over 10

ly. It's inhabited and colonised by mainly kinds of fish, specifically, a hyperintelligent strain of carp known as Feesh. More about the Feesh can be found out in the Feeshverse Overview section.
Glossary
Feshillion - A really, really big number; indescribably, incomparably large. It usually refers to a number in the double or triple stacked exponents.
⌬ Feeshverse Overview ⌬
Structure, Map & Regions
The Feesh
The Feeshverse is a mainly empty void with a few 10
24
-verses (the 10
24 th
EDA
). About 0.0928% of it has been filled with liveable water, but most of it cannot physically sustain water. Inside the water, most Feesh go about a comfortable life, under the rule of a council of Feesh. (We will not get into the governmental structure here).
The Feeshverse is surrounded by a seemingly inescapable border, which cannot be destroyed at all, like a
Xemtaverse
, with a seemingly infinite energy source, that can't falter no matter what we try.
Apart from that, the Feeshverse contains many clouds of cosmical 10
24
-dust: exploded 10
24
-verses, which are basically just a "gas" of any random stuff, encapsulated in a border.
The Feeshverse is, surprisingly, 42 dimensional. Wow, Douglas Adams was right! Anyways, since the 10
24
-verses have a higher dimensionality, you must exit them on a specific slice of the verse. The space you reside in, in which your being is crunched down to 42 dimensions is called the "Limbospace", and the farther you get from the 42-plane the more corrupted you become, so it is not feasible to escape the Feeshverse this way.
Besides that, the Feeshverse has many man-made features, or... fish-made? Wait... no, FEESH-made features.

Transportation
[

Stargate Central
A gigantic central area; Stargate Central boasts incredibly sophisticated instant teleportation technology to any other Stargate. Any place in the facility can be instantly teleported to, and Stargate Central also features an incredibly fast infiloop network to get to most major destinations in the entire Feeshverse. Finally, Aqua-Transport & Quanta-Beaming can quickly transport you inside a bubble to any other intermediate Universe. Stargate Central (the official one) is the most expansive and features the fastest transportation options, but there is a Stargate Central for almost every 10
24
-verse complex in the Feeshverse.
Kranier Tourism HQ
The HQ for archversal tourism. Feshillions of tours and destinations. You can be whizzed to almost any amazing and wonderful destination you wish for, and all of it can happen while inside the Krainer Max, the top-of-the line ship that is Feshillions of km wide. There are Feshillions of them ready to take you on any tour. More details in the Products section.
The VTC Store
If you're looking to buy a
Verse Transportation Craft
, then the VTC store is for you. With Feshillions of locations, the VTC store has many, many options to customise, try and create your own PERFECT Verse Transportation Craft. Used by many, many corporations Feeshverse-Wide, you can count on the VTC Store to make your dream craft become a reality.
The Quantumspace
This is a gigantic hyperdimensional warped space in the Feeshverse used by Quantum Transfer Solutions Co. It's used to redirect any items, and is also used for storage and rent space for other corporations, particularly factories.
Industry
[
]
The Omnifactory
The Feeshverse's largest industrial production company, also known as FishCorp Industrial Division, produces gigantic factories for megacompanies. It's largest factory is the Omnifactory, which is an interconnected network of merged 10
24
-verses, along with various technologies from insta-teleportation companies to create Feshillions of products every microsecond. It has multiple different megastructures in one and is very, very, very, very, very, ok you get the point, expensive. However, with how big the Feeshverse is, there are an insane amount of Omnifactories inside the Feeshverse.
The Metafactory
The factory used by GigaFactories and FishCorp Industrial division. It's more of a machine that builds factories bit by bit, but can also make Feshillions of smaller ones. It's even MORE expensive but still quite common inside the Feeshverse.
FishCorp HyperD Storage
The largest storage facility in the Feeshverse. It's used by FishCorp, and is a hyperdimensional amalgamation of Feshillions upon Feshillions of 24127-verses, storing basically infinite lower dimensional items and Feshillions of ultra-dimensional technologies.
