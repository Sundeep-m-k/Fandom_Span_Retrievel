👁 the slapper
,
or eye the slapper if you don't want to use emojis, is a weird mega-entity who has massive amounts of power. He can easily destroy other overpowered entities (Read a bit below), but he isn't really THE STRONGEST. There are other entities that are a lot stronger (Like
TOGs
),
but we don't know about a lot of them, at least for now
.
outdated lol
If we were to talk about his behaviour, a lot of time he is friendly. You could talk to him and he will not attack you. When he sees another cosmic entity, he doesn't immediately become violent. But when a fight starts, he goes full savage. He fears Trascendent Omni Gods, because they can delete him with no effort. So he begs to be spared, even if the TOGs don't intend to harm him in the first place, which is rather funny.

Yes, and guess what it is.
If you answered with male, congratulations! Thats the correct answer.
Sorry for making this part short, but idk how to make it longer without making it boring.
👁's Great Power
[
]
👁's Abilities
[
]
Self-Preservation:
Total protection from being weakened by other entities with a similar power.
Punch barrage:
Transforms into an extremely fast fist that punches over 10
100
times per second from all angles, sometimes much more, irregardless of his current size.
Space-Destroying SLAP:
This is the ultimate ability which gives 👁 the "slapper" part of his name. It's so strong, that even entities ~5 times 👁's strength can be destroyed instantly by it, and verses near the impact are completely deleted from reality. This attack consumes most of 👁's energy, however.
Slap:
A weaker, (around a third of the strength), but easier to use version of the space-destroyer slap. It also consumes lots of energy, but can be used a lot more than the previously mentioned slap.
Regeneration:
The ability to heal himself from attacks and replenish energy. It's passive, but quite bit slow, so this ability isn't very useful in the midst of battles.
Healing:
A faster version of regeneration. He can quickly heal himself or other entities, and even revive them. This ability, like the Space-destroying slap, needs a lot of energy, so it needs to be used carefully.
Size changing:
He can become bigger or smaller at will. When he gets stronger, his size limit also grows.
Extremly high speed:
Quite self explanatory.
Superwarp:
Instantly warp through any border.
Transcendium
summoning:
👁 can generate Transcendium without help, so he can power himself up at any time. The stronger he is, the more he can summon at once. He can also use it as a material (for example a shield) but it's not very effective. The Transcendium that is summoned can be extremely dense, being capable to be used like this to do a nuke-like attack. Generating a lot of Transcendium at once can get 👁 tired, though.
Transcendium
transformation:
A variation of the previous ability, 👁 can transform objects into Transcendium if they're weak enough. Not very different from the previous skill, but does save on the energy required to spontaneously generate matter.
Life creation:
👁 can use the previously mentioned particle to generate living beings instead, being "guards" of him. This ability is not very strong at first, but can overwhelm an enemy as time goes on.
Entity location:
Not a combat ability, but 👁 has a device that helps him at locating entities up to
Outside the Wiki
tier. This ability gets stronger each time he finds a new entity.
Short-term adaptation:
👁 can obtain temporary abilities that are made to specifically counter enemies. The only one that has been permanent is the Self-Preservation
Unconfirmed abilities
[
]
Respawning:
Considering 👁's power, it is likely 👁 can respawn.
Property changing:
👁 might be able to change their existence rank, finality index, etc.
Every
DK
power:
👁 might have all of DK's powers, too.

dies, because he cant decrease 👁's power.
DK
becomes monkey soup, delicious... Then he respawns! MONKEY CLONING. But... he is doomed to become monkey soup again.
👁 will start crying if he sees an
TOG

Robert
gets shrunk into nothing.
Chunky Cheese
is no longer chunky.
Pyrite
is completely obliterated.
👁 gets destroyed by the very spooky
Mips rabbit
. There are many possible scenarios:
Scenario 1: 👁 attacks Mips rabbit and is obliterated instantly.
Scenario 2: 👁 attacks Mips rabbit and Mips does nothing at all.
Scenario 3: 👁 does nothing because 👁 knows of Mips rabbit's insane power, or it's just too bored to fight.
Scenario 4: Mips and 👁 become friends. I think everyone would rather have the 4th scenario happen.
Another entity that can easily one shot 👁 is
The Editor
.
Bob
is inside of his pocket dimension, so 👁 can't reach him yet. But Bob can't reach 👁 either. But, in a fight 👁 wins easily. Well, that could happen if we talk about the past Bob. New bob with Ultimate Tog power could easily destroy our one eyed friend.
The Entire Perfect Imperium
is destroyed instantly.
Future
Smallians
would be destroyed in a few minutes to a trillion OYC depending on whether or not 👁 has DK abilities.
Far Future Smallians would destroy 👁 instantly, but that will happen in a LONGGGGG time.
Palf
cannot put 👁 into the Gulag
The
Transcendent Guardian
would easily defeat our one eyed friend, but they wouldn't fight.
Eely the Eelbot
would be easily defeated by 👁, but they would never fight.

👁's Creations
[
]
Transcendium forcefields
Transcendium entities
Transcendium factories
First showcased on the 6th chapter of 👁's story, these are basically extremly dense Transcendium accumulations that instead of being consumed, 👁 uses them to put things inside to protect or lock them inside. The first time they were used, 👁 used it to protect Eely's remaining particle using the forcefield as a shield.
First showcased on the 6th chapter of 👁's story, these are entities purely made of Transcendium. The first time they were used, 👁 took advantage of the fact that a few Transcendium particles are able to generate life, creating these beings to guard Eely's remaining particle.
First showcased on the 9th chapter of 👁's story, these factories produce Transcendium automaticly without 👁 needing to do so, and at a faster rate. 👁 can upgrade them to become stronger, but a stronger factory also needs more strenght to create.
👁's relationships
[
]
Eely the Eelbot
Gerald
δεύτάο
Transcendent Omni-Gods / TOGs
Idontknow350
First showcased on the 4th chapter of 👁's story, he's a very powerful Eelbot and 👁's best friend, always sharing adventures with him. He died on episode 6 but has been revived since (this part has not been featured in 👁's story yet). Eely is MUCH weaker than 👁, but he's still much stronger than the rest of his kind since he also absorbed Transcendium.
First showcased on the 6th chapter of 👁's story, he's one of the entities that 👁 hates the most since Gerald indirectly caused Eely's temporal death. After 👁 taking his revenge by defeating him, they're on better terms since (last part not featured in 👁's story yet).
First showcased on the 9th chapter of 👁's story, he and 👁 didn't have a lot of relationship, other than he won a Transcendium factory giveaway, imploding of joy. This wont be the end of the character, tough... his name is a shortened version of the words δεύτερο κακάο, meaning "second poop" in Greek, due to this entity being originally created in the
DIARRHEAverse
. Quite a curious backstory. All I can say about his future on the series is, he owes one to 👁...
First showcased on the 7th chapter of 👁's story, 👁 fears
them
since he thinks he may one day find an evil TOG that end up deleting him. Poor 👁! :(
First showcased on the 7th chapter of 👁's story, this is one of the few if not the only TOG 👁 doesn't fear since
Idontknow
already gained 👁's trust. He also helped him giving 👁 a tracking device to find tons of strong entities.
👁's story
[
]
IMPORTANT
: The user
Someone who owns a fish
is developing a remake of the story, its W.I.P can be found
here
. When it gets finished and if the original creator of the article aproves it, it'll get added here.
The start
[
]
25 OYCs ago, 👁 was born. He was originally an
blueprint particle
that weirdly started evolving very fast, the one causing this will remain unknown for now... When he reached the size of an hydrogen atom he was capable to start consuming
Transcendium
, starting his long journey.
Why didn't he die when consuming it even if Trascendium is extremly hot?
Because he was actually extremly strong (
Universe Cluster
power already) even if he was just atom-sized.
Size matters!
[
]
After consuming an amount of Trascendium enough to make him the size of the width of an ADN, he was capable of generate his own Trascendium in bigger quantities than before, making his growth easier. Now he has the power to destroy
MLTI-577
.
When hes 100x bigger than the width of an ADN, he grows an eye, and his body colors get a bit shinier. Now
megaverses
with sizes lower than 10 decillion light years can be easily destroyed by 👁.
After a time, he reachs 100 µm. Soon he could even be visible to human eye! Now he can make entire planets purely made of
Transcendium
just to make him grow, and grow, and grow even more!
Now 👁 got a size of 1cm, and we can see him without any special artifact, like miscroscope. Now he can easily destroy
Petaverses
, even if they have their max size posible (
10
1100
500
{\displaystyle 10^{1100^{500}}}
LY)
The ideal height
[
]
👁 was growing more and more, becoming more and more powerful, and he reached a point where he reached the height of 2 meters. But he didnt like that height. After a lot of effort, he achieved a new power: The size changer. Now he can eat all Transcendium he wants, without  getting bigger. Now he can be peacefully talking to humans. Oh yea, i forgot to tell that now hes an true superstar. Everyone is fan of him, because his enormous power. His favorite size to be with humans is 1.65 meters. But, he has a max size. Eating more
Transcendium
makes him capable of having bigger possible max sizes. I explain this better:
In this part, his max size is 2 meters, and can change that size from the size of an
Blueprint particle
to, well, 2 meters. But if he eats more Transcendium, his size limit could increase to 2.5 meters. Got it? Nice! Lets continue.
Lets go higher!
[
]
After some months, 👁 leaved earth to continue his epic travesy. When his size limit increased to 5 meters, he could turn entire small asteroids into Transcendium. When his max size turned to 7m, not even
Wekaverses
were safe.
A new friend
[
]
When his size limit turned to 10m, he met his first opponent, an
Eelbot
. The fight was very tied, but 👁 winned. Then the Eelbot gived lots of Transcendium👁 as a victory reward. They becomed friends, and both promised that they will continue this epic adventure.
With that huge Transcendium increment, 👁 could make entire Transcendium planets. The Eelbot also got habilities from 👁, making him way stronger than an average one.
Nothing really interesting happened in the period of a few days, but in a moment 👁 sucefully destroyed an
Omniverse
. His friend Eelbot was a bit scared of his friend, but deep inside he knowed that he would never hurt him.
👁 asked to Eelbot then: "Do you want a better name than just Eelbot?" Eelbot sayed yes, and both maked the perfect name:
Eely the Eelbot
, or just
Eely
. Eely loved that name, and their friendship was even higher than before.
What is this?
[
]
Eely and 👁 (current size limit: 15m) were traveling like another day, until they found a very weird object:
The Sphere
. 👁 slapped the Sphere in an attempt to destroy it, just to impress Eely, but then he got hurted by the Sphere.
"MAN WHAT WAS THAT?!" 👁 said confused and a bit harmed by the hit. He didnt know that the Sphere was too tough for him. Then Eely and 👁 tried combining powers in an attempt to wreck the Sphere, but still nothing. They gave up eventually, and continued their never-ending travesy. But 👁 will always remember this, because he soon knows that when he will become stronger, he WILL destroy that Sphere (spoiler: he didnt).
"Sorry Eely, i didnt know that Sphere was that hard" Sayed 👁.
"It's okay, i also got surprised of the hardness of that thing" Sayed Eely.
👁 is never going to recover from this humilliation. Probably.
A new badge
[
]
Some time later, 👁 (current size limit: 35m) finally tried to do something that could make him feel proud of himself. He called Eely to see too, and they traveled until they finally finded a
Box
. Eely watched it, and then... B O O O O M ! ! ! The box exploded. 👁 was very happy and proud of himself, he started being just an small being and look now his strenght! Eely clapped a lot. But, deep inside, 👁 thinked about the beings who were inside that box, and he felt a bit sad.
The cetaverse's enemy
[
]
Literally 4 minutes after 👁 (current size limit: 36,5m) destroyed that box, lots of
Ceta-warriors
came. 👁 and Eely didnt know what was happening, until the warriors said:
"We are a group of entities that protects our
Cetaverse
and all contained by it, and you broke a rule! Surrender now, or burn in hell!" said one the Ceta-warriors. Obviously 👁 wouldnt let himself to be arrested, and the first not-friendly fight started. Eely obviosuly joined in to help his best friend. The fight ended with 👁 and Eely injured, but as the winners. The Ceta-warriors left, and 👁 healed Eely. What? 👁 didnt know that he could do that! But well, he learned that new hability. 👁 generated lots of trascendium in a short time so he could be stronger if the Ceta-warriors come back.
They soon will.
Cetaverse's nemesis
[
]
In a matter of time thousands of Cetaverses got notified of this now existent threat that resulted dangerous to them, preparing an all-out attack to stop 👁 (current size limit: 40m) from commiting a short-term evolution once again and becoming even stronger.
Did the Ceta-warrios win? Theres 2 ways to answer this.
Short answer
Long answer
No.
Not really. Even after all these troops got sent and teleported to the place 👁 and Eely were, our pair of friends already have gotten strong enough to completly overpower the armies. So, in one point these soldiers just gave up and hoped that 👁 would spare them and their 'verses.
Didnt work.
The Great Loss
[
]
There's nothing relevant to talk about 👁 (current size limit: 225m) and Eely's journey trough a bunch of verses until
The Great Triangle
. Even tough the duo weren't actually evil, they still were causing quite a bit on havoc in their path, even tough it wasn't really intentional. They left the Triangle, without knowing what would happen to it just some moments later...
This Great Triangle got attacked by one of the scariests gods below Alphasm, known as...
Gerald
, going to destroy it since he was bored. The Cetaverse's warrios and their verses inside this Triangle got destroyed 0,0001 voidseconds after Gerald appeared,  👁 managed to escape the Triangle's destruction... but not Eely. Gerald already dissapeared, 👁 was desperatly searching for any remaining of his friend to revive him... but he couldn't. He knew he could find one of his pieces soon enough, tho... even if the chances were astronomical, he WAS aiding his friend after all. And he, somehow, would try to take revenge on whatever thing did that to his friend.
Search for revenge...
[
]
As weird as it may sound, the journey to find an Eely's non destroyed particle was actually quite short. 👁 managed to find it just minutes later, but he actually didnt revive him right away. He was scared to lose him, yet again... 👁 decided to trap this single particle in an extremly small yet dense
Transcendium
(dont worry 👁 didnt crush Eely's particle) and sent him to a nearby Box, also creating multiple Transcendium beings which 👁 managed to convince to guard the main sphere.
His journey would now be focused on searching whatever that thing was, and defeat it... there was a problem tho, and it's that 👁 barely had the opportunity to see Gerald's appareance, and would try to seek help to known more about the target...
TOG's help
[
]
👁 was wandering on a Great Square to search more proof... he could find remainings of the attacked Triangle, but nothing else to help in his investigation... this is when 👁 found a weird entity that seemed quite strong, and so he tried to talk with it. This communication ended up being succesful, this entity being the
Transcendent Omni-God
known as
Idontknow350
.
The conversation lasted for a while, but 👁 ended up knowing quite a lot of things, even more than the ones he needed... the entire existence of TOGs (that ended up scaring him so much he still fears them), all the
Official
,
Extended
and
Cosmic Entity
Hierarchies, and the thing he really needed, who was to know the one entity that destroyed his friend,
Gerald
...
👁 tried to convince Idontknow350 to boost him or just kill Gerald, but the TOG said no since this story would end up too early, and it would also make 👁 unable to know more about this entire
Wikiverse
... Idontknow350 did help him in another way, giving 👁 a special device that localizates cosmic entities, including himself if he wants more advices.
👁 finally understood that this MUST be HIS journey, and finally left, being glad to have received some help (But still with the TOG trauma lol, it's never going to dissapear in fact)
Lets go higher... again.
[
]
Some time has passed since the previous chapter. 👁 already has a current size limit of 10 megameters, and his current goal is to keep turning things into Transcendium for more power. At this point, he already reached peak class 3 structures, the
Peraomniversal Complex
.
Some time after, it already was time for him to reach bottom class 4 structures, the
Uniperaverses
. Just like what happened in the Cetaverses, 👁 was seen as a threat for many, but this is sadly how it works...
In fact, he almost died once since
Melinda Ice
tought he was a bad guy and went after him, letting him live after realizing he's not evil but just in a neutral entity searching for revenge. 👁 didnt even try to convince her to help him to go after Gerald because he would be breaking Idontknow350's petition to do it himself.
Fun, unrelated fact: Melinda Ice is WAY stronger than Gerald. Gerald is below Alphasm, Melinda is way above him.
There were more of these 👁 / Cosmicialverse gods encounters, but he always managed to convince them that he was not evil.
Better production!
[
]
Another timeskip, 👁 already has an infinite max size and he's already into upper class 7 objects (meaning he's already post
Official Hierarchy
) but just now he just realized he could've made Transcendium-producing Transcendium machines.
This took quite a while for him, but he finally pulled it off, managing to create entire factories of extremly massive Transcendium for him to consume. He still needed to practice even more for stronger and easier to make factories, and after a bunch of days he finally upgraded them to the point he liked to.
Just to clean a BIT his reputation, he tried doing "giveaways" of Transcendium particles or even entire factories to random entities. Thanks to this a lot of entities managed to become a LOT stronger, like for example a class 2 entity known as δεύτάο managed to become a class 4 in a short matter of time, but ended up imploding of joy. I dont know if this was a good or bad ending, but it's certainly an ending after all.
But... this ending won't be permanent for δεύτάο. All I can say is that 👁 is really going to be awarded by his actions, real soon...
(This history is a WIP, and i will add more things soon, maybe...)
Trivia
[
]
He's blue since he originally was a blueprint particle.
This means he's a sentient blueprint particle, probably the strongest one recorded.
Some even call him "Blueprinty" just because of this, but 👁 doesn't like that nickname.
I dont even remember if I made 👁 based on
Bob
or not. Probably yes, though.
