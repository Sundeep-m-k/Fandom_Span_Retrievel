About
[
]
The
Earthcubeverse
is an unique
verse
which appearance-wise looks similar to the
planet
Earth
, but having the
shape
of a
cube
instead of a
spheroid
's, being the reason the Earthcubeverse received said name. It is the first
Cubeverse
that reaches the scale of the
absolute infinity
.
The Earthcubeverse also has a nest notation of

The core

The core is a special section within the Earthcubeverse, in which the contained
Decacubeverses
are so dense that about

Trivia
[
]
It produces
strings
in its core, increasing the Earthcubeverse's temperature by a wide margin.
The strings can also wire the core's content into cubes, which later transform into Decacubeverses.
