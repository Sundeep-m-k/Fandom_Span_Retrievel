Eighteen
("

The Pencil Language
or
Yodak
in Future English) is the next verse in the Eleven Chain, and is one of the last. Weirdly enough, light does not travel in Eighteen, making it appear static while it really isn't.

Appearance
[
]
Eighteen is claimed to have a pitch black interior. The way Eighteen looks on the outside is undetermined due to no creature being able to make it outside of Eighteen.
Structure
[
]
Eighteen's structure is mostly unknown due to how hard it is to observe a seemingly static verse. All reports of Eighteen said that it had a void-like interior with little signs of any matter. Any traces of a
Seventeen
have not been found, but it is presumed that Eighteen has 18 Seventeens, thus continuing the trend of factorials.
The Mysterious Creature
[
]
Some creatures have claimed to have heard another creature inside Eighteen. Several disappearances inside of Eighteen have been blamed on this creature. It is still unknown whether this creature is actually there or if it is just a hoax.
Expeditions
[
]
There have been many expeditions through Eighteen. Most have recovered valuable information.
This was the first expedition into Eighteen. 1093 creatures from different civilizations discover Eighteen's property of having static light waves.
100 creatures are sent into Eighteen. Over 78 died from still mysterious circumstances. The remaining 22 had to be rescued and all suffered severe mental trauma. The deaths are mainly said to be caused by the creature inside Eighteen.
5 creatures are tasked with finding a border of Eighteen. None seem to make any progress, and communications are lost after only 4 hours of the expedition. The expedition was cancelled shortly after.
17 blind creatures with exceptional hearing are sent into Eighteen. They claim to have heard a strange sound within Eighteen but were not able to pinpoint the exact location of it. All of them came back completely unharmed.
