OYC
ago, 👁 is born, as a lone, anomalous
Blueprint particle
in some obscure corner of a
Transcendent Verse
known as Earth. He has no will, no feelings and no sentience.
All he knows is that he must grow.
Within a few hours of being born, 👁 was roughly the size of a hydrogen atom - a mere 100 picometers in diameter, large and powerful enough to begin eating
Transcendium
and growing even further. Although tiny, 👁 was already strong enough to completely control the area (around 1m) around him, and his power only grew exponentially from here on out. Being born in a small
Transcendium
patch, 👁 is in luck.
Size matters!
[
]
After consuming enough Transcendium to grow to the width of one DNA helix, and his understanding of matter grows as well, he develops his first ability: the ability to convert existing matter into
Transcendium
. This ability is quite rudimentary but it does aid him in his journey. Although small, he has the energy capacity of a whole city.
At 300nm, he grows an eye, he becomes a little shinier, and he gains the newfound ability to destroy matter, and has the energy capacity of all power on Earth,
After some time, he reachs 100 µm. Soon he could even be visible to human eye! Now he can easily convert gigantic chunks of matter into
Transcendium
just to make him grow, and grow, and grow even more, and soon enough 👁 is 1 centimeter, and we can see him easily without any special instruments like a microscope. Now he has the capacity and power of several solar systems, and is capable of influencing nearly all of Earth.
The ideal height
[
]
👁 was growing more and more, becoming more and more powerful, and he reached a point where he was 2 meters tall. But he didn't like that height. After a lot of effort, he gained a new power: The size changer. Now he can eat all the
Transcendium
he wants without getting bigger, and peacefully talk to humans. Oh yeah, i forgot to tell that now he's a total superstar. Everyone is a fan of him, because of his enormous power. His favourite size to be with humans is 1.65 meters. But he has a max size. Eating more
Transcendium
makes him capable of having a bigger max size.
After a few months, 👁 left Earth, and humans, to continue his journey. When his size limit increased to 10 meters, he could turn small asteroids into
Transcendium
, and could manage all energy in the Solar System, as well has having a peak power output of several thousande stars.
A new friend
[
]
As 👁 started exploring Proxima Centauri and beyond, one of the planets turned out to have a malfunctioning
Eelbot
named Eely (technically EELBOT PROXIMA 776.273.2932 but Eely and 👁 obviously thought that was a bad name). He was very weakened and was damaged, but the civilisation forgot to terminate the core before abandoning him. Therefore, Eely lived alone on one of these planets. Upon noticing 👁, Eely took him by surprise and attacked him. Due to 👁's power he was able to make this a fair fight, but in the end 👁 won. Eely respected 👁 and gave 👁 a large amount of rare materials, including
Transcendium
as a reward. From then on, 👁 and Eely became very close friends.
With that huge boost, 👁 could now create mine, convert and generate large asteroids to create huge amounts of
Transcendium
.
A new discovery
[
]
Soon, 👁 was the size of a planet, he had eaten many star systems devoid of life (hopefully) in order to gain tons of mass and power. Soon enough, he gained the ability to consume planets and stars telepathically, which was incredibly convenient. Along the way, they came across a star system named "Aɪdəʊnt-Nəʊ" to give its native name. Aɪdəʊnt-Nəʊ was very well known for business and industrialising everything. So, 👁 was interested in them and he decided to talk to one of the industrial representatives on Fʌkɪŋhɛl (the 4th planet). After deciphering the language barrier, 👁 was able to get a new, special supersized device: The "Sʌm-ˈstjuːpɪd dɪˈvaɪs", in return for a large surplus of Blueprintite, which was what 👁 was made of and granted insane power.
Using the Sʌm-ˈstjuːpɪd dɪˈvaɪs, 👁 could now create machines using solely
Transcendium
or Blueprintite, which was converted into a highly efficient machine casing for machines. While this did require him to sacrifice his power, he could make devices such as
Transcendium
factories, which converted any matter into
Transcendium
, and Transcendites,
Transcendium
mechanisms that 👁 could spawn.
Galactic
[

After a few years, 👁 was at this point the size of several light years. He had visited many solar systems and civilisations, some of which were eager to trade. One of which, the Фак ю, gave 👁 a perculiar device that allowed him to scan anything and filter anything at any size, which gave him a huge boost. At this rate, 👁 was becoming more and more powerful with his increasing technology. 👁, however, was getting quite bored of travelling huge distances at 100c, which was slow at these scales, decided to evolve a new ability. He now had super speed, and could travel at any speed given sufficient power. This allowed him to exit the Milky Way within a few hours.
An Uno Reverse
[

Now, 👁 had eaten quite a lot, so he was at this point very, very powerful, and he had an idea. Now, 👁 had eaten many huge things, like whole star systems and star system clusters, but one thing 👁 hadn't tried to eat was a black hole. So, what better place to try than Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of the galaxy? He told Eely: "I'm about to do something very cool."
"Riiiight, yeah, you mean something very, very stupid."
👁 didn't care about common sense, however. So he channeled all his energy to absorb the black hole. At first, the black hole was absorbed by 👁, and 👁 didn't feel anything different.
"Admit it Eely that was so coo-AAAUGH WHAT THE ███ IS GOING ON WHAT THE HELL MAN" The singularity had failed to be, let's say, digested, and was now DIGESTING 👁. It was starting to grow as 👁 was shrinking faster and faster. "AAGH EELY DO SOMETHING DO SOMETHIIIING PLEASE ITS EATING ME MAN"
Without thinking, Eely zapped the singularity with his half-functioning
Glitchonicite
gun, which glitched out the black hole into nonexistence, saving 👁.
"Wow, thanks Eely you saved my lif-"
"Don't
ever
do something "ReAlLy CoOl" ever again."
Post-Galactic
[

👁 had learned his lesson and from then on made sure to destroy the singularity before absorption.
After slurping up many galaxies, a few galaxy clusters and some cosmic filaments for good measure, 👁 was extremely large. The Фак ю was badly damaged due to the balck hole encounter, so 👁 had to sacrifice a large amount of matter to create a supersized Фак ю that could remove all the
Transcendium
from a galaxy immediately. 👁 quickly became over 1000 light years wide and had eaten a good chunk of the Universe. Wondering if there was more beyond, 👁 decided to use his new warp feature on the Universe's, which should technically work. To everyone's shock, this was one of 👁's ideas that didn't result in destruction and/or nearly dying for the 72nd time so far.
Now, you'd think that 👁 would learn his lesson after trying to absorb an infinitely dense object, NOT to try and absorb a whole cosmic megastructure. He didn't.
"Hey Eely look I'm gonna try and absorb this universe", 👁 said as he powered up the Фак ю.
"
NO.
Every single time you try some stupid shenanigan like this you nearly die!"
"Well,
nearly
die."
"👁 I swear to god do not fire that f██g device I will-"
"HEHEHA YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO". A loud bang fired through the cosmos and the Universe 👁 fired at began to rumble as the Фак ю began to spark.
Space began to twist in on itself as the Universe EXPLODED, creating a sinkhole to the inescapable beyond and inevitably 👁 was pulled in.
"EELY YOU GOTTA HELP MEH IT'S PULLING ME IIINNN IT'S PULLING ME IIIIN" However, Eely's
Glitchonicite
gun had malfunctioned several weeks ago, and he couldn't help at all.
"It's not working! I don't know use your slap thingy or something!"
"HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO SLAP A VOID- OH ██. OH ███. OH ██. ██! EELY THIS IS THE END. I'M SHRINKING EELY." As 👁 was pulled deeper into the sinkhole, he mustered up what little power he had to try and warp out of the black hole to save him a few seconds. But just as he was about to accept his fate and die, the sinkhole closed, creating a huge shockwave that blasted 👁's defeated and tiny body right back to Eely.
"Yeah, I'm sure you have a very long lecture prepared for me right now-"
"You're the absolute dumbest fudgxking creature I have ever met."
Archverses
[
]
Over the next few millenia, 👁 grew exponentially, consuming a new
Archverse
around every day. The regular
Archverses
took a day, the
Extended Divergent Archverses
took about 6 months, but all 10
24000
took an extremely long time. To absolutely nobody's surprise, he almost died billions of times due to his own stupidity, and ACTUALLY died about 78 times, but thankfully the CERV in the Qazaverse revived him every time he died. With every new technology discovered and every new civilisation encountered, he became smarter, more powerful, and gained millions of minor abilities. He had reached such a large size that the interior became a Non-Euclidean
Blueprintverse
, inhabited by a host of alien civilisations. As such, 👁 had full control over the
Blueprintverse
, and could influence anything that existed inside of him.
