The Trefoil Barrier is a barrier shaped like a trefoil knot. It contains all objects in the
Knot Chain
, and its edge is made out of many of the surfaces of
Hencentroverses
.
The Trefoil Barrier was originally named as a joke that it was relatively easy to escape, but later it became what was used as the name and eventually became it's official name.
Edge
[
]
The edge of The Trefoil Barrier, as I said, is made out of surfaces of Hencentroverses. Note that these are
not
Hencentroverses, just the surface of them. Because of this, the Trefoil Barrier is pretty easy to get through.
