Cundilam
(symbol: Cdm) was a partially
cuandavic
atom. It had 32 protons and 17 cundavis. It had a density of 188 g/cm^3. It was often reinforced with other materials, such as steel, to create incredibly tough alloys that were used for building. It was created by bombarding indium with heavy amounts of cuandavic rays. This can get you many different cuandavic elements, and it used to get you cundilam as well. Cundilam was completely synthetic, with it being nigh-impossible to occur in nature for an unknown reason.
As of now, Cundilam as a whole no longer exists.
Explanation of Nonexistence
[
]
Cundilam is no longer able to exist in any capacity. An initial "nonexistence" event occurred in 6778
OYC
, where any cundilam previously existent before the nonexistence event vanished and no longer exists. This destabilized many structures, including the ███ █████, which lead to approximately 6,285,157,454,341 deaths and approximately $33,441,781,172,154.76 in property damage. It is impossible to create cundilam, as any cundilam formed immediately disappears.

The following is an excerpt from the test log of the page of
The Conspirator
:
6778
OYC
There is a
cuandavic
material known as 'cundilam', a very useful building material used in many different structures.
There is no record of any material existing being known as 'cundilam'.
