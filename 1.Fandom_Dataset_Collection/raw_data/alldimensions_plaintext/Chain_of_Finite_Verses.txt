(35) less from biggest finite number, light years. But finite-sized verses almost completely cut down appearing at certain size (one of little tiny happy exceptions being
TREEVERSE
), before starting to appear at infinite scale and beyond. This chain is about finite verses between that size, but listing only most common ones.
Gammaverse gives someone who enters it blood disease, fatal radiation dose, inhalable radioactive metals for free! Not pleasant condition, but it is like angel as you go through rest of hierarchy. Btw Gammaverse is
plutfuseverse
sequel lol
Coldverse is verse at temperature of omniverse’s Absolute Zero temperature, which is much colder than universe’s Absolute Zero temp. Everything is eternally frozen here. And sadly, even at temperature where absolutely nothing can rot, politicians and majority of industry heads do...
Starverse is, sadly a verses that are now only existing as nebula of former rich, active, and horrifying lands of hostility. However, even leftover nebulae emit more energy than big shinoverse!
Acidverse is not THAT hot compared to most verses, nor as hostile as others. The only little problem is, name “acidverse” is not a name given to this verse for no reason. Acidverse is filled with acid capable of melting any verse or structure border in an instant.
Particleverse “was” somewhat similar to condition of Tremendous-1500. You can imagine Particleverse as really, really active and chaotic version of it, with particles constantly fusing together to release energy big enough to sustain never-ending big bangs.
Lavaverse is extremely hot verse, exceeding the temperature of starverse. Although very few particles are drifting inside lavaverse, each one of drifting particles have energy capable of melting a planet it touches in an instant.
Spectroverse contains countless different regions allowing different spectrum of radiation. Ehhh… not necessarily radiation only. Spectroverse is quite “buggy (?)” verse, sometimes allowing regions to change properties.
Name “Electroverse” pretty much tells everything about it. Lightnings of immeasurable size constantly flashes across the verse, and immense electric field contains the verse.
Glowverse is less “buggy (??)” version of spectroverse. Allowed spectrum of light is even across the entire verse, and that allowed spectrum changes randomly as the time passes.
Blazeverse is hot verse with temperature far above comprehensive temp. Energy level breaking the roof of physics causes all sorts of weird things, such as giant flume of particles erupting out of verse.
Plasmaverse has, unsurprisingly, hot temperature. What fills plasmaverse with plasma of various substances is its property to disintegrate everything into tiniest bit and raise their temperature to crazy level.
Mysteryverse is a bit like QRverse (recommended to read this page first). However, instead of just showing image of random verse after certain amount of time, mysteryverse becomes condition of random verse.
Tempverse is basically Glowverse but with temperature instead of light spectrum. Being similar to Glowverse grants Tempverse to cause all sorts of weird temperature-related events.
Starverse (attraction type) is gigantic cousin of starverse that avoided destruction due to its size, ironically, keeping it alive (this is unique because majority of big verses are unstable). And because of size, this sort of starverse curves space around it so much, it becomes so much altered, strange, and unstable.
Starverse (higher attraction type) is little more chonk version of above, having a lot more attraction force. With this much attraction, starverse becomes one of weirdest finite verses, with logics breaking down.
Positiverse… is literally a verse with high positive charge. “high” is not ordinary high, but rather the strongest magnetic field among all finite verses. It can even have direct effect on infinite-sized verses!
Mineverse. You read it right. And no, it is not associated with Minecraft, nor it is filled with explosive mines. The verse is extremely unstable and is like “mine” drifting through omniverse space, waiting to explode as soon as another verse touches it.
…lies a
fantastic
verse

gates to
everything.

[

Ever imagined a verse filled with all sorts of 💖FANTASTIC💖 radioactive metals you can CHOOSE FROM!? 😍😍 Or a verse giving you 😎FREE RADIOACTIVE DISEASES AND FATAL RADIATION😎?? OMG😲😲😍😍!! You found JUST RIGHT PLACE🤩!!! THIS VERSE IS FOR COOL DUDES!!😍😍VISIT GAMMAVERSE AND BE A COOL DUDES😍😍😍😘😘!! YOU ALSO GET FREE 😲😲BOBUX OMGGGG🤑🤑!!!
Ok let's push cringe mobile game advertisement satire aside (because I am starting to feel embarrassed), and talk about real properties of gammaverse. Firstly, as it is put in truly random satire part, Gammaverse contains great diversity of radioactive materials, each one of kind having whole lot different properties than another. Radioactive material's type is determined by sort of "atomic number".
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Coldverse
[
]
Description about coldverse at brief summary tab really tells everything. Even though drastic temperature difference inside coldverse makes some unique events, it is mostly boring verse, with everything frozen and not moving at all (from our perspective). Even things usually considered almost impossible to freeze, are frozen here, or at lease "frozen" in some other forms.
Sometimes tho... exceptions can be made... like how some strict discord mods do when they see an E-girl (it's little non-famous meme, so you can skip past this because it is not important). Did you know that at Antarctica (where the temperature is several tens of degrees below 0), liquid water instantly freezes then explode into cloud of snow? Similar phenomenon can also occur when cold liquid nitrogen  is poured into something with temperature close to absolute zero.
What I am trying to say is, that extremely cold place of seemingly same temp everywhere, can have temperature differences of insane scale (more insane in case of place like coldverse pissing straight on average temp between verses). Now instead of putting all range of coldverse's temperature into one single "cold" category, imagine like coldverse having huge pockets of extreme heat (not that cold spot) everywhere and usual temperature zone (VERY cold spots).
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Starverse
[
]
Starverses exist across all finite sizes, and these kinds are smallest. Bigger types have almost whole lot different properties than the originals, which are the smallest ones. Now for properties of smallest starverses, they are more radioactive than Gammaverse, more energetic than Shinoverse, and finally, more hostile than any place life can ever hope to live. at least... they were.
For some reason I will mention later, smallest starverses all exploded into nebula of active gas of former starverse.
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Acidverse
[
]
"With most potent kinds of "acid"s accumulated inside acidverse, you can dissolve whole verse with size similar to acidverse in a matter of second. With weakest potent kinds of acids accumulated inside acidverse, you cannot even use it as vinegar." This vaguely describes how many varieties of types and potency Acidverses' acids have.
Acidverse is like fairy tale's witch house, where there are countless elixir inside. Just whole lot bigger. Then why do "Acid" verse contain other weird elixirs than acid? is it acidverse going
"confused twerking"
?? Well,
sort of
yes. Like coldverse, pissing on sets of vital laws between verse, acidverse also pisses on sets of vital laws between verse, in all sorts of ways. But pissing on vital laws is not really good choice, since it breaks the verse and cause "glitches" all over the verse.
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Particleverse
[
]
Another remnant-of-former verse. Its environment was like primordial universe, where particles bump into each other so hard that they push each other outward, causing expansion of, well, inter-versal scale. in fact, particleverse expanded so hard, its border disintegrated. Physics laws were diluted with laws between verse, creating gradiation sort of physics laws.
However, the verse is still observable as its past state due to lightspeed set by particleverse physics is very slow. Old light radiates away and gets faster because no law limits its speed. Then the light projects particleverse's past state to outside world.
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Lavaverse
[
]
Someone who first read the brief info about lavaverse might have said instant "wth-". Understandable because it is hard to imagine little tiny particle striking random planet and causing instant destruction of it. Even the fastest discovered particles (except lightspeed particles of course) cannot come close to fraction of lavaverse particles' average energy.
Ok, if there are particles with immense energy, flowing through vast space of lavaverse, where do they come from??
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Spectroverse
[
]
There it is, a verse glitching on its own, accidentally creating more diversity of properties. Zones inside spectroverse clearly distinguishes from one another, since there can be insane property differences between each zones. These weird-as-hell zones (some having properties made by "glitch" of spectroverse) are basically main component of spectroverse.
If there was no "glitch" with spectroverse, it would have been boring place (still it glows with all sorts of mystic colors). However, spectroverses' physics are broken, allowing many objects to defy laws of spectroverse. With no limit at what can be or not be, zones go crazy and produce sometimes beautiful or ugly scenery such as inside-spectroverse verses or huge pile of amogus.
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Electroverse
[
]
When
the imposter is sus!1!1!!!1
I mean when the electroverse occasionally decide to emit its energy in form of electricity, electroverse briefly exceeds brightness of starverse. It is not good since something brighter than starverse usually causes major harms to other verses around it, destroying them. So around electroverse, there are no verses except few crazy ones, and structures inside electroverses constantly change from electroverse bullying its own physics law.
Occasional electric bursts radiating from electroverse is so strong, that it builds up magnetic field capable of attracting other verses close to electroverse. After that, the burst destroys close verses it attracted... that event produces fragments of verses floating around electroverse. If one of fragments decide to collide with electroverse, electroverse says "I like ya cut g-" then releases electric curst, incinerating any fragment at the way of colliding with electroverse.
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Glowverse
[
]
When one, changing spectrum region takes over entire spectroverse (although it is totally not how it works), it is now glowverse. Glowverses are often a lot bigger than spectroverse, and has much more regular physics. This does not allow any bad glitches such as spectrum region being altered to something weird. By the way, glowverse has wider allowed range of spectrums than spectroverse, so possible numbers of event are much higher than spectroverse.
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Blazeverse
[
]
Blazeverse has countless giant fire "orbs" floating inside it. Fire orbs are neither a star, nor any object glowing by causing energetic reactions. Fire orbs work very similar to how gigaverses act inside
shinoverse
. They are lasting clouds of fire, triggered by explosion of verses. Blazeverse is like overgrown shinoverse in that side, and it almost is!
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Plasmaverse
[
]
Add more energy to blazeverse and you get plasmaverse. Simple enough!
Except it isn't
. Matter and energy density of plasmaverse is much higher than blazeverse. When high-energy spots are much closer than they like, they make verse expand faster and its average energy level much higher. Result of high-energy spots hating each other is themselves becoming more energetic and making the verse go more
wheeeeee
!
Abnormally energetic fire spots (they are plasma spots in plasmaverse) can sometimes create another fire spot, which becomes plasma spot. Resulting extra plasma spots accelerate expansion of plasmaverse. So the size of plasmaverse is getting beyond-exponential boost every nanosecond. Expansion is so noticeably fast compared to other verses (of course except ones made to expand), it can destroy other verses while expanding so fast!
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Mysteryverse
[
]
Mysteryverse is
QRverse
sort of verse which certain verse gives information about every other verse there is, few at a time. However, mysteryverse is much better than QRverse. Reason? Well, while QRverse only displays images of six random verses among endless amount of verses, mysteryverse
becomes
random verse. This is like, wayyyyy too overpowered without any limitations.
Badly for mysteryverse, and good for pretty much everything, mysteryverse's size is limited to exact point. Only condition becomes like other verses, and the size of mysteryverse does not change.
e v e r
. What happens when verse that cannot exist if it is smaller than mysteryverse, or a verse with another mysteryverse? well, mysteryverse ignores every other factors and just... replicates condition.
For example, if mysteryverse decides to replicate a verse completely filled with mysteryverse, mysteryverse ignores all of them and will replicate countless-small-mysteryvere-container-verse without any mysteryverses in it. It is sort of like trying to get around the laws with some holes like: "if you rob a store naked, no one can see the footage without committing a crime". In that case, police (which is mysteryverse in this case) are likely to just watch it and put you in a jail.
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Tempverse
[
]
Tempverse is kind of flipped and amplified version of coldverse. Unlike coldverse, where everything is experiencing merciless coldness, tempverse is hot,
v e r y   h o  t
. If coldverse is low peak of omniverse's temp, tempverse is high peak of omniverse's temp. Well, it is not infinite for sure since something finite containing infinite energy breaks into pieces. Instead, max temp of tempverse is closer to largest finite number than anything normal number systems can describe.
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Attraction Starverse
[
]
Starverse THIS big have successfully avoided destruction. Size of starverse became big enough to have meaningful attraction (similar to gravity) among other verses. Sure, you may ask "wth why is it so hard to attract other verses when small verse can shred others by electromagnetic attraction?", and answer to that is electromagnetic and other methods of attraction is really strong compared to gravity-type attraction.
That is mainly because to form gravity-type attraction inside inter-versal space, a verse has to curve spacetime between verses.
Like that's ever gonna happen
for common verses. Only verses like attraction-type starverse, which has so much energy that it even avoided destined destruction of itself, can curve extremely "hard" spacetime of between verses.
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Stronger Attraction Starverse
[
]
At some point, when giant starverse's attraction passes certain point, it gains bunch of new properties. Its attraction also becomes super strong, nearly as strong as a black hole between verses, where nothing falling into starverse's attraction influence region is able to get out. Anything crossing attraction border of stronger attraction starverse will be shredded into pieces.
WIP PART!!! MORE DETAILS COMING SOON!!!! :DDDDDDD
⌬Positiverse
[
]
Assuming you are immune to high energy, and your travel method can reach any finite speed, you will occasionally see indescribably huge networks of verses forming countless curves extending from one, unobservable point. This network (or verse web) is so big, that if observed in scale of finite verses such as
archverses
before omniverse, it would be as well as just be impossible to find out how the network looks.
Center of the biggest network in omniverse (something explained above) is positiverse. It spins fast enough to emit as much light as most energetic finite verse, and produce  magnetic web so strong it can carry near-uncountable number of verses to form the network. Inside the positiverse ranks among the most extreme condition in omniverse.
⌬Strength of magnetic field
[
]
Positiverse magnetic field's total power exceeds the power needed to give a scratch to
almighty NOKIA3310
's outer case. With that said, it is easy imagine how powerful positiverse's magnetic field is. If it can damage NOKIA3310, it can damage pretty much everything from biggest finite verse to
plot-armored main character
. Oh and it also means positiverse is stronger than plots lol.
⌬Unobservability of positiverse
[
]
Aside from the fact that positiverse has pretty much uncountable number of powerful verses obscuring its true identity with unimaginable energy, positiverse's power adds more security to positiverse's identity. The reason is, that positiverse has too much magnetic field. magnetic field around positiverse bends space like lunatic, creating a weird space curve never seen before. Every direction you try to get close to positiverse, only leads you to get farther away.
It just means that inside of positiverse is impossible to observe, and even with The Box's
power
, protoverse is too rebellious (for reasons explained two headings below).
⌬No temp, no dimension?? Wth??
[
]
This weird-as-hell properties are direct influence of
The Box
's properties. The Box's property to bring impossibility at in front of
door
eye
perception itself affects positiverse's dimension and temp. Normally, The Box's impossibility property will create some weird poops such as impostor that isn't
sus
, NOKIA3310 that
breaks
, and all sorts of impossible weirdness across Positiverse, but magnetic shield is all powerful.
⌬But how can some random
finite verse resist The Box
[
]
Actually, magnetic field's total strength (energy) is between border of finity and infinity. Field stretches all the way close to size of omniverse, however not exactly to a level reaching omniverse's size. That helps pushing space of box's influence to meaningful level, so effective region of The Box never truly reaches positiverse (so does everything else).
⌬Posi

Positiverse's magnetic field sometimes rips off the space itself, give boost to verse formation, and do all sorts of
pog
good or
unpog
bad influences to its direct influential region. Of course, space and environment around it is
shaken to its souls
. Environment is eerie, seemingly chaotic. Networks and objects collide, but there are laws of Positiverse governing how actions will cause always same outcomes.

⌬Mineverse
[
]
There is unique verse flying between verses, wanting to consume enough material to... explode and pretty much annihilate everything in largest finite number radius. Mineverse is pretty much the limit where verse (ones that are not structured to be stable) can be stable. Any verse bigger than this staying at low energy state is near-impossible.

This verse has no name, bizarre properties, and one factors resembling
quantumverse
. There is nothing of matter. instead, there is only energy and "sort of" wormholes stretching to everywhere. Like quantumverse, the wormholes lead to everywhere in quantumverse. That's right, that means this
"Between time..."
thing has a complete control over quantumverse, which is basically above everything (physics) in every reality.
