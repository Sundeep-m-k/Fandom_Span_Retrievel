The Incraverse is a verse, that has 3 regions, some of is subdivided into 2 regions. They vary in temperature cause of Incraborders and Incramatter.

Incraborders and Incramatter
[
]
Incraborders
are borders arranged in a spherical manner, that has polygons arranged with spacing. Polygons and spacing depends on which Incraborder you're aiming for.
Incramatter
comes in two types, Tempamatter and Cocramatter.
Tempamatter
is very hot, reaching up to vigintillions of Kelvin hot, And tempamatter's opposite,
Cocramatter
is, you guessed it, ice cold. The coldest Cocraparticle ever recorded reached a staggering
-10
100
Kelvin!
Regions
[
]
The Core
[
]
The Core
is a hypersphere with the same dimensions as the Incraverse. The Core is split up into two regions, the outermost region is the
Outer Core
, The Outer core is mostly solid, like a rock with cracks. Inside is a network of paths where Tempamatter need to come through, there are some Temparings which heat up anything inside the Temparings. The innermost layer called the
Tempacore
is the inner core, made of temponium, a material that creates tempamatter, weirdly, every 5.1 OYC, There is an event called the tempaplosion, where significant amounts of tempamatter explode from the tempacore,
The Circumference
[
]
The Circumference
is the outermost part of the incraverse, the outermost part called the
The Edge
is the part where significant amounts of Cocronium, a material that creates Cocramatter, weirdly, Cocronium does not have any Cocroplosions, But if you mix it with Temponium, making a cocroplosion, The temponium that was mixed, became Cocronium, while the inner part, called the
Universal Point
is the most stable point, home to 89% of the verses it contains, however, which type and data of the verses it contains is unknown.
The Warmth
[
]
The Warmth
is the point where temperatures are over absolute hot, around 100 Nonillion Kelvin,
The Cocrawarmth
is where the temperature is between absolute hot and the diameter of the given diameter of the Incraverse measured in LY, so of it was 10 Quattuorquinquagintillion LY, after the Cocrawarmth area is the part where it is between absolute hot and 10 Quattuorquinquagintillion Kelvin, the innermost region called the
Tempawarmth
is the remainder of everything left,
Technology
[
]
In the year 5192, we have farmed temponium, now we can make a Exponential warmer, which is a much faster way to make stuff warm for even better technology, for example Versical Telescope, which when combined with a temperature cooler, which needs a Exponential Cooler, Which needs Cocronium, and temponium, we can magnify up to 10
557
times bigger to visualize with even better view of the verses possible to find! (Yes there is good quality images.)
