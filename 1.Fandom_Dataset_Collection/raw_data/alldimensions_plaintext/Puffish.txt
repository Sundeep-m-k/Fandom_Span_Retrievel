Puffish is an old, ancient and quite complicated language created by the
Puffians
, it also has an alphabet to go with it, called '
Puff-Glyph
'. The language itself is genderless (Because Puffians do not have gender either). Puffish when spoken by
Puffians
sounds nothing like human phonemes, so a romanisation was made to be used for anthropic sounds, all below information about that language is referring to that transcription.

Language Rules
[
]
Each word has to be of a single syllable, with a few exceptions (E.G Boogl)
first a selection of 0, 1 or 2 consonant words, 'θ' (th) will not make the normal sound, instead, use 'C' as a replacement, same goes for 'ʃ' (sh), 'tʃ' (tsh) and 'ŋ' (ng), for those, use Q, X, and Ŋ (in that order) as replacements.
next, either 1 or 2 vowel sounds (They must be the same vowels if it is 2).
Lastly, another 0, 1 or 2 consonant words.
An apostrophe or dash can be added to a word to fuse it, this can be done any many times as needed.
Other vowel rules:
a = /a/, aa = /æ/, e = /ɛ/, ee = /e/, i = /ɪ/, ii = /i/  o = /o/, oo = /u/, u = /ʌ/, uu = /ɔ/
For translating names or to spell words, use letters to make something that will sound the same/ very similar, put it in quote marks.
Examples:
Ethan = 'Iic-An',
Jonathan = 'Jon-Ac-An',
Hello = 'Hel-Oh',
Earth = 'Erc'
