The
Ultraverses
from the
Generic Hierarchy
, also known as the
Tultraverses
are enormous verses that have very attractive colors. The most common is a combination of blue & yellow (which can be seen on the infobox), though rarer variants have more unique color schemes such as one with opposite colors, a monochromatic one (white & black), multicolored (with more than just two colors) and the rarest ones have their color scheme constantly changing over time.
Color variants usually have special traits, such as:
Reverse color variants contain more antimatter
Multicolor variants contain more
Transcendium
Color changing variants are highly unstable
TGH Ultraverse's mini chain
[
]
Unlike smaller TGH verses, Tultraverses only have 3 layers, which is way less than the hundreds of layers previous verses had. Each one has a scientific name to recongnize them better:
- Minul
(Smallest)
- Melult
(Medium)
- Megultras
(Biggest)
Each layer is roughly 2000 times bigger than the previous one, though the size difference varies on each individual Tultraverse.
Why do they have the same name of the Ultraverse?
[
]
Because they are too similar in properties, such as having many
gray holes
, being above many "Archverses" of the Generic Hierarchy such as
Collectionverses
,
Giganticverses
, etc.
As a measure to stop the confusion, the
Tultraverses
name was given. Before you ask, the T doesnt mean anything by itself and it was just added to differentiate. Its not the most original nor greatest name, but it sure does work.
