Goymaverse VI
is a strange verse. It's called like that because it was discovered by
an entity named VI
, and has enough similar properties to the
Goymaverses
that it's classified as one of them, despite its size. Some people don't like it being called this due to it breaking the chain, so they call it VIgormaverse, Vigoymaverse, or even Jẽclőgoymaverse.
It's laws similar to the Goymaverses, but containing the sound of laughing.
Composition
[
]
Goymaverse VI is mainly made of raspberries. These raspberries are sweet, but they instantly teleport you out of reality and into a giant void. This void doesn't really do or have much, and has absolutely nothing in it except for the occasional mushroom, which will kill you. Goymaverse VI also has some
Uqraek fibers
randomly floating around. It also has a core area where the deeper you go in, there's more and more
Glitchonicite
.
