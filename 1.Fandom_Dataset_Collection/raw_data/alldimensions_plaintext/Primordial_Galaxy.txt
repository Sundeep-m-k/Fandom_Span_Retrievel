The
Primordial Galaxy
is another structure in the
Primordial hierarchy
. No entities have been able to get here due to the obliteration rule (first mentioned in the
Primordial Nation
article). In order to view such objects, scientists and astronomers had to use a
Primordialscope
.
The size of Primordial Galaxies is the same, no matter what
Primordial Universe
you are in. The temperature of Primordial Galaxies overflow the Infi-Bit Integer Limit. In fact, they may even be hotter than
the Ovens
outside of the areas with planets, stars, etc. Not that much else is known about Primordial Galaxies.
