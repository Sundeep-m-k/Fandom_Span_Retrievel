The
Photoverse
is verse, which is
extremely
compressed with photons. So much so, that any disturbance to the
Photoverse
's size / compactness would
instantly
colapse the
Photoverse
into a black hole.
The
Photoverse
expands each second by its age (in seconds), in light years, the age of this verse is 13.7 billion years.
Due to this expansion, photons appear to
slide in and out of existence
, seemingly through a
different dimension
.
