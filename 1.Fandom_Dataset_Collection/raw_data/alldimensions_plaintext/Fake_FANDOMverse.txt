Fake FANDOMverse contains all the
Fake Wikiverses
in every state as well as other parts in this
Verse
, so it is the entirety of "Fandom" website, a fan platform full of communities known as Wikis where anyone can edit, share and discover to. But, Fake FANDOMverse is the inverted one to
FANDOMverse
, so it is the smaller variant of it. And it is much less glitchier than the ones (wikis and pages) it contains, due to being nuch larger and originally more stable.

Fake FANDOMverse is just an example of many
Fake Websiteverses
across
Fake Googleverse
that exists. Fake FANDOMverse is a popular fan platform alike many other platforms and websites. The Verse currently contains 385,000+
Fake Wikiverses
existing now, so it has lots of more space left for the wikis to be founded and pages to be created. In fact It has so many voids that indefintely more of them can be. It also currently has over 50,000,000
Fake Pageverses
existing. Because of this, none of the wikiverses and Pageverses could ever transcend Fake FANDOMverse, no matter how big they are. Thus, this verse is too self-containing. Fake FANDOMverse contains
not just
fake wikiverses, it also contains the dark heart (due to it being inverted), the void where all fake Pageverses are deleted and fake wikiverses closed, etc.

Things that it contains

Fake FANDOM
[
]
This planet, is a major part of Fake FANDOMverse where every wiki is placed, whether they are founded, closed or not founded yet. So, it also has got the all the Pageverses in all states. This place even has got things that have been done negatively to the growing of the wikia but not actually are. This is called the Fake Voiderplex.
It is divided into smaller parts called Fake Wikibox.
Fake Wikibox
[
]
This contains all the Fake Wikiverses that exist and doesn't exist. It is kind of like
The Box
but contains Fake Wikiverses. It is contained by a cluster called Fake Wikibox Cluster, the ogntianer of all the Fake Wikiboxes.
Fake Wikiverses
[
]
The Verses are communities generated by the
Fake Pageverses
they have. All of them are different in sizes, varying on how many pages they have. The biggest one is just at the center of Fake FANDOMverse, as it is the central wiki for all other wikis.
The dark heart
[
]
It is the logo of Fandom and has got some info for what Fandom is going to be about. It also shows the statistics of Fandom and the introduction of this website.
Fake Voiderplex
[
]
A self-containing void where every pages and wikis not created/founded are here. And also it is the place of where deleted pages are.
Growing of Fake FANDOMverse
[
]
Every time a Fake Pageverse/Wikiverse is created/founded, it grow a bit. Creating both of them is as easy as creating how you create a page, found a wiki. Finding a wiki makes it grow faster than creating a page. Also, it is easy to say that the more content you add when you are creating/editing, the more the Fake FANDOMverse grows. When you post a post, message or a comment, you, as well grow community by taking about something.
However, if you (a
TOG
) delete a page or a post, this (negatively) grows the community. Even though it is negative, the actions are actually making the wiki better. But it doesn't make the fake FANDOMverse get smaller because there is a place where every deleted page and post are keeped so that when going to create/undelete, it's no longer be in there.
Sometimes, your contributions will
not
make the community grow and so it doesn't:t even make a significant change at all.
So, Fake FANDOMverse growth depends on what you are doing to the entire wiki and the platform.
