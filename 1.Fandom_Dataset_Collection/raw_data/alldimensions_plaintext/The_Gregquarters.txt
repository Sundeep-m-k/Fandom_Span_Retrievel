The Gregquarters over the GregTech Dimension
The Gregquarters,
also known as GregTech HQ, is the headquarters of
GregTech Ltd.
. It is placed in orbit around the surface of the
GregTech Dimension
, although it is unknown how it is able to orbit an infinite plane. It is inhabited by Gregorius T. and thousands of his workers.

The Main GregFactory
[
]
The
Main GregFactory
is a giant factory that produces large amounts of various GregTech products. It features thousands of high-tech machines which are constantly being supervised and maintained by workers.
Bedrooms
[
]
The
Bedrooms
are hundreds of rooms where the workers sleep. They are connected by hallways and elevators.
Greenhouse
[
]
The
Greenhouse
is a large, open space that has automatic farms for millions of plants from billions of
Verses
. These plants are used for further processing and also consumed by the workers.
The Greg Mansion
[
]
The Greg Mansion
is a luxurious mansion that is inhabited by Gregorius, the CEO of GregTech Ltd. . It features like a zillion robot servants and butlers yahoo
The Greg Office
[
]
The Greg Office
, also known as the
Groffice
, is the place where Gregorius stays to have very important meetings about products sales and stuff.
Storage Room
[
]
The
Storage Room
is a room that folds space-time to be able to contain virtually infinite items in a finite space. It is used to stockpile quadrillions of materials and objects to be used in machinery.
The Lab
[
]
The
Lab
is a multi-room complex where the Researchers spend most of their time. It has stuff like quantum computers, whiteboards and high-tech machinery.
Workers
[
]
All workers are either robotic or semi-robotic. There are 2 types of worker:
Creative
and
Industrialist
.
Creative
workers are semi-biological workers with modified DNA, with brains specialised for creative thinking.
Industrialist
workers are more robotic, and do non-creative labor.
Maintainer
Designer
Manufacturers
Marketers
Researchers
Maintainers
are
Industrialist
workers which maintain machines in the Factory or the Greenhouse. Their hands are the tools which are used to fix these machines - as such there are maintainers with wrenches, screwdrivers etc. for hands.
Designers
are
Creative
workers which design new machines to be mass-produced. At the start of each day, their brain is connected to an enormous database logged with the latest trends and economic changes all over infinities of verses so that the designers know exactly which types of machines have the biggest demand. The database also contains the amounts of materials in the Storage Room, so the Designers know what materials are available to use in the machines.
Manufacturers
are
Industrialist
workers which create the machines designed by the Designers. There are specialised Manufacturers which are proficient in using specific machines to create the products required to make the new machines. The Manufacturers have access to the Storage Room.
Manufacturers are also responsible for wiring.
Marketers
are
Creative
workers which make advertisements for machines. Like Designers, they are mostly biological with brains specialised for creative thinking. All Marketers have a deep understanding of the psychology of thousands of species, which makes them able to get the maximum interest.
Researchers
are
Creative
workers. They use their creativity to do scientific breakthroughs in technology, being those discoveries new chemicals, materials, processes or even things like particles. These discoveries are implemented in new machines if they are useful.
