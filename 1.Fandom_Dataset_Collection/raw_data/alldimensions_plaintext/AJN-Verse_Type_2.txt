About AJN-Verse Type 2
[
]
Type 2 AJN-Verses are more abundant than
Type 1s
, because some don't contain
Type 1s
. They are located somewhere between
Antiverse
s and
Binumberverse
s. They were discovered a few weeks before
Type 1s
, though the date is still unknown because they were marked down in lost journals by scientists, one having the initials AJN. They are popular with the blue humanoids, that take them from the location. They are also used for treats for the cats, though are deadly for people with a lack of calcium.
