Not to be confused with the term
superior verse
, which describes a verse which contains another, smaller, verse.

The superiorverse is an extremely rare
verse
that resemble normal
universes
. Superiorverses are much larger and contains on average much more life compared to
universes
. Not only this, superiorverses can also be much more dense in planets, stars, and have larger
blackholes
due to more mass to consume. On average, a universe has a 1 in a 10
100
googolplexes to become superior.
Superiormultiverses
are multiverses that only contain superiorverses. We have discovered a superiormultiverse before, but outside of it, we have only found two superiorverses. Superiorverses typically have advanced life on at least one planet in nearly every single solar system. This promotes competition, and often creates cosmic wars and disputes.

Life
[
]
Life is very common in the superiorverse, as on average, more than 15% of
planets
contain life advanced enough to travel to other galaxies, and additional planets may contain hard to detect life that might have not reached any of their moons yet. A very notable species are the superiorities, species that thrive in superiorverses. Every single superiorverse found so far has multiple superiorities contained inside of it. Superiorities extract energy from the many supermassive
blackholes
that scatter the superiorverse.
Barrier
[
]
The barrier of the superiorverse acts like a
blackhole
. It pulls matter and light in, and it is extremely difficult to get out. However, many of the properties of the superiorverse's barrier are different from that of a
blackhole
. For example, superiorverses can be escaped without the use of wormholes, and some light does manage to reflect off of the barrier of the superiorverse. The superiorverse has a very strong barrier but very small particles and negatively-sized objects are able to escape the superiorverse. The superiorverse's barrier may grow back if destroyed, but no recorded breakage of the superiorverse's barrier exists yet.
Artificial Barriers
[
]
The life inside of superiorverses have developed protection against
Sproyongs
, which are multiversal viruses capable of oblitterating entire universes. To accomplish this, superiorities, along with another species, banded together to collect a natural resource in superiorverses, known to the outside world as superiorite. (The species that reside in superiorverses call this material a different name, which isn't currently known.) The superiorite can't hold the virus created by
Sproyongs
, but the natural barrier weakens and dampers them, allowing for the superiorite to resist these.
Though no
Sproyongs
have ever collided with any superiorverse, the superiorite can keep out very tiny particles that would slip outside (or inside, if the particle had enough force and energy) of the normal natural barrier, providing some use.
Laws
[
]
Superiorverses share very similar laws to universes. The most notable difference is that species living in superiorverses experience faster time, as superiorverses are somewhat resistant against gravity. Gravity resistance, and as such, the speed of which time passes, varies between superiorverses, but only by a few nanoseconds every year. Gravity resistance seems to depend on size; larger superiorverses tend to be less affected by gravity, and have higher gravity resistance. Other laws of superiorverses generally stay very simular throughout, but may differ slightly, like universes.

Notable Features
STV-1
110 Quintillion light years
First and largest superiorverse ever discovered.
STV-2
67 Quintillion light years
Last superiorverse ever discovered. Nothing else is interesting about this superiorverse.
SMV-1
4 Quintillion light years
First superiorverse discovered inside of a superiormultiverse. It may have also been the third superiorverse to ever form.
SMV-2718ZB
181 Quadrillion light years
Smallest superiorverse ever discovered. It also may have been the second most recent to form.
SMV-1721AC
13 Quintillion light years
Known to be full of life, this superiorverse was the origin point for the superiorities species. This was also the first superiorverse to use an artificial barrier.
SMV-718A
17 Quintillion light years
Interestingly enough, a universe once collided with this superiorverse. The barrier of the universe was ripped apart, but many features made it's way through the superiorverse's barrier and remained mostly intact.
