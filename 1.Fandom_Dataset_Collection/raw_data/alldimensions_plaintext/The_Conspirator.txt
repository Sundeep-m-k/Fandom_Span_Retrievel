The
Conspirator
, also known as the
Conspiracyverse
or
UNI-9122
, is a verse in a
Multiverse
that when entered by any
organism
capable of advanced thought, makes them a firm believer in one or more possibly randomly generated conspiracy theories. These theories, very usually, are completely nonsensical and sometimes contradict the organism's (sometimes) previous beliefs, with conspiracy theories given by the Conspirator sometimes being able to contradict something that the organism knows past exposure to the Conspirator, and even each other, sometimes directly.
An organism already affected by the Conspirator is unable to be affected, nor any native organisms or organisms brought into the verse derived from native organisms.

This is an abridged log of conspiracy theories from organisms coming from the Conspirator. Some were chosen at random, others were chosen to highlight the nonsensical nature of the theories. These theories are taken verbatim from the organism's original words.
