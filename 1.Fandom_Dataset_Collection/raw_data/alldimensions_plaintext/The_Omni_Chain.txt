The Omni Chain
is a post-
Box
chain directly after the
Omnipyramid
and
The Box
. There are 9 objects in the chain, starting with the Omnimarble and ending on the Omnimountain. This chain is contained by the
Cetaverse
.

The Omnimarble is an infinitely big marble that contains the
Omnipyramid
on its top, as well as
The Box
and many other Omnipyramids and boxes. It is made out of Hemrium, the 2401st element, which makes it immensely heavy, causing it to not be able to roll over. The Omnipyramid is gravitationally pulled down to the Omnimarble, making it also stuck in position. This property is shared by all other bodies in this chain, except for the Omnipyramid, which relies on
The Box
's weight, balance and inability to come into contact with 0 - 70 dimensional bodies.

The Greek letter pi
Position
Contained by:
Omnifish
Contains:
Omnimarbles
The Omnipi is a giant version of the Greek letter pi (π). Its flat top is used to hold the Omnimarble steady and stable. It is made out of Emmenium, the 651st element, Pramium, the 782nd element, and Klantannium, the 1444th element. The top is made out of Emmenium, which has an extremely strong gravitational force, so much so, that it would destroy any nearing object. This is remedied by a 1 atom coating of Pramium, which has the opposite effect, but much stronger, thus, the 1 atom layer subdues the Emmenium into regulable conditions. The Klantannium is in the legs, which causes the whole structure to freeze in place, due to the property of lack of mobility of each Klantannium atom adding up exponentially.

The Omnifish is an extremely big fish, more specifically, a salmon. It is made out of Chernobyllium, the 2,147,483,648th element and Omnipis. It is alive, and swims through the voids of the Omniwater. Its cells are made out of Omnipis, with the Omnipis being protected by Chernobyllium membranes. The Omnifish, unlike underwater fish, doesn't need water to live. The Omnifish is a highly respected being, due to its wisdom, knowledge, age and selflessness.

The Omninfinity is a lemniscate-shaped object that has Omnifish laying on its bumps. It is made out of Pragomun, the 4011th element, which has a calm texture, which is a perfect resting spot for the Omnifish, and very comfortable for them. "Barren Omninfinities" are ones which are on the Omniyam, and they do not have Omnifish laying on them, but there exist Omninfinities in the Omniwater, which are the Omninfinities Omnifish lay on.

The Omniyam is an infinite yam that holds the Omninfinity close to its stem. It is made out of organic material, similiar to a normal yam. The yam is edible, and many civilizations use the Omniyam to import edible materials into their planets. The yam has been described as tasting similar to the yams in
Our Universe
. Multiple civilizations also exist on the Omniyam, using their ground as a food source. This doesn't impact the Omniyam whatsoever, due to its size.

The Omnitree is a tree that holds the Omniyam on one of its stems, which is located near the center. There is a large area around the Omniyam, approximately 3 times larger than the Omniyam, that is empty, giving way for incoming beings to enter and exit. The Omnitree acts also as a sort of barrier for the chain up to this point. Any attempted instances of attack on The Box have failed, as the Omnitree's leaves (Omnileaves) are operated by the microbes living and making up them, thus, being able to fight off any predators easily with joint group effort.

The Omniceberg is an infinite iceberg that has the

Omnimountain
sticking out of its side. The iceberg is made out of Gremimium (992nd element), which acts like an insulator, and can keeps its cold temperature indefinitely. The Omniceberg is only 1 kelvin, it has held this temperature since its creation. At the bottom of the Omniceberg, temperatures reach 3 kelvin, which is the hottest. The center is the coldest, at 0.02 kelvin.

The Omniwater is a verse in which its boundaries are malleable, which means they can bend. Through, its volume is always the same. In other words, it's a verse made entirely out of liquid. It is entirely made out of H

A mountain that is beyond space-time, this structure is a basic pyramid. It supports the foundations of all things lower than Omniwater and betrays the ones above it. However, nothing can go to it, not even the spaceship built to withstand space-time corruption. But, there is one way to overcome this, and that is going to Omnifish.
Only then you can go higher into the voids....
