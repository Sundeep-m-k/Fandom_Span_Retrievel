Conceptual Gates
are gateways between conceptual and non-conceptual things. They use abstraction to specify which
particles
follow conceptual principles or not.
Whether they are, particles use distribute
laws
that sort themselves by complexity. These laws should be simplified as possible in order to sort properly, and must be entangled within simpler particles.
Nonconceptual things go beyond concepts, but they defy logic at all. As so, these concepts could not be comprehend by
the First Realms
, and alien logic can only be seen here. Alien logic is entangled infinitely and are too complex to abstract, even predicates and simplicity don't help; diving deeper into layers below
