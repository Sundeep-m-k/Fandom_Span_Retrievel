The Wakapakalakaverse (also known as the ever distorting rainbow swirl) is a swirl made out of swirls made out betacorolaphium, and in the middle of the swirls is qwazypogoverses. The name comes from the sound it makes "wakapakalakamakapakaeakaqaka...". It stays together by the color forces of betacorolaphium, if it were black and white, it would break apart and explode. if your wondering "why does it distort?", thats because When betacorolaphium gets hot, it starts to whirl and twrild and wiggle.
