Species
THE animal
The
iotaverse
is a special
universe
that contains
THE
owl as well as
Δ-class stars
. These are the rare stars in this universe. The planets they have are rich in iotinium, a rare metal in iotaverse, and the material for making weapons (commonly swords) for
Iotaversers
who live in iotaverse. The weapons are very powerful as they can cause a cut
that could kill others
while fighting, due to its high quality of iotinium being so sharp. However, the material is so brittle, it'll shatter into small pieces, so they use it very thoroughly.
There are lots of life in the iotaverse who thrive on habitable planets. The planets which habor life (iotaversers and
THE
owl) are so advanced they don't even look like themselves. This is because the species here advance quickly within thousands of years and now the universe is entirely controlled by them.
THE
owl

THE
owl is
THE
animal exists within iotaverse. It is here to control and guide the iotaversers and the leader of this universe. It also created the first galaxies so that there'll be more and more galaxies. The black holes here are weird (the game changer was
THE
owl) because if a piece of matter enters it, the amount of matter increases rather than entering a black hole. A bigger black hole would increase more matter and some black holes with the mass of 10
11
or higher solar masses are enough to form several thousands of even millions of galaxies. It is also somewhat alike ordinary owls and is the main black hole of iotaverse. It even created a whole new type of material, iotinium and it's properties.
