All high-effort and good pages
The Higheffortverse is a verse containing a lot of good, original, and quality pages, which is pretty much everything in the category
"good page" categories
. The Higheffortverse is much smaller than its counterpart, the
Loweffortverse
, due to how there are way more low-quality pages than high-quality ones.
The Higheffortverse, due to how very little high quality verses are produced, is very barren and empty. Each verse in the Higheffortverse is protected very well by 15 guardians, each of which have different powers. These guardians are very powerful, being able to destroy any entity with ease that isn't high Class 1 or above on
The Official Cosmic Entity Hierarchy
.
The Higheffortverse is also guarded very well, and a verse will need to be scanned and checked extensively for a very long period of time to be able to enter the Higheffortverse. If a low-quality verse somehow enters the Higheffortverse, it will immediately be ejected and sent into the Loweffortverse.
Every verse in the Higheffortverse is monitored extremely closely in the case that they are actually low-effort. If a verse's quality is controversial, the rulers of the Higheffortverse will set up a verse-wide vote. If the verse is determined to be low-effort, it will be ejected, and if it is high-effort, it will be kept.
