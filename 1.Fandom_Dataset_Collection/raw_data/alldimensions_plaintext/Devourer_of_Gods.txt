You are no god... but I shall feast upon your essence regardless! - Devourer of Gods
Devourer of Gods is a cosmic worm entity. An entity of many titles and reputations, it is easy to conflate the truth and myths of its many legendary deeds. Though Yharim once believed that the essence he devours is utterly and completely erased from existence, it is a fundamental rule of creation that energy cannot be destroyedâ€“ it can only be transferred from one form to another.

Devourer of Gods
Devourer of Gods at his core is a worm enemy, featuring a head trailed by body segments and ending with a tail, flying through the air and digging through blocks. His body segments have  high
Damage Reduction
, though his head and tail segments do not and will even take increased damage, rendering them the primary targets for dealing damage. Devourer of Gods has 82 segments in total during Phase 1, and 102 segments in total during Phase 2.
When initially spawned, the background/sky will tint blue, and Devourer of Gods will fly and circle in the air over the target in a manner. Warped is affected on all entities, which multiplies their vertical velocity by 1.01 every frame, in turn making them more lightweight.
After 15 seconds (initially), continuously charging at the target. Replacing Warped, the Extreme Gravity is affected on all entities, disabling flight.
Phase 1
[
]
Devourer of Gods does:
Summons 3 Cosmic Guardians.
All segments inflict the God Slayer Inferno and Whispering Death.
Every few seconds, fires a simultaneous barrage of aimed Death Lasers from his segments.
When at 90% health, on intervals, fires an additional barrage of death lasers from the sides of the target, telegraphed by lines in a X-like pattern.
When at 60% health, Devourer of Gods will become intangible and fly into a portal, starting the transition to its final phase.
Phase 2
[
]
Devourer of Gods does:
Retains his periodic laser barrages.
He periodically fires Death Fireballs from his mouth which inflict the God Slayer Inferno Debuff.
When at 50% health and after 12 seconds, he will turn partially invisible and fire 2 quick horizontally and vertically moving laser walls, with gaps between them for the target to remain in. Occasionally the laser patterns from Phase 1 will also be included with the laser walls, either the horizontal or vertical lasers not appearing in these patterns. The lasers are telegraphed by lines which appear in front of where the lasers will be shot. This will occur every 12 seconds.
When at 20% health, Devourer of Gods will force a laser wall attack, then spawns a portal near the target, and after a few seconds, teleports to the portal in a large burst of particles and charge at the target, additionally summoning 3 Cosmic Guardians. He now gains a speed boost and no longer uses laser walls.
When at 15% health, the sky will turn pitch black again.
