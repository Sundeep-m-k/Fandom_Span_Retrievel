Green Plains
are the fifth verses in the
color plain chain
and, weirdly, one of them with the least percentage of life, even if they have good conditions for it to happen. Also, plants and similar lifeforms are the ones found with the most frequency in them. What a coincidence!
Other fun facts
[
]
- Their temperature is a bit lower than
the White Plains
, but its still fine. They can hold life similar to
our
planet
's.
- Green plains have their color mostly due to having a special type of
stars
within them, which glow green. They also have many blue and yellow stars which are very close to eachother, which logically ends up forming green too if seen on a proper distance.
