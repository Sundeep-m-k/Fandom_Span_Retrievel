The Infinitiality Of All Verses
coexists with
TDOAV
. Its core energy comes from the two halves of
TDOAV
, and as neither half can exist without the other, neither can TIOAV. Without them, TIOAV would collapse into nothing. However, without TIOAV,
TDOAV
would immediately go out of control and balloon so much that only the immense pressure of
TTOAV
could ever contain it. Thus, the pair of TIOAV and
TDOAV
have simplyâ€¦ existed forever. What may have happened is that the sudden forming of two
TENOAV
s must have simply conceived the other.
We do not know of any special or anomalous properties that makes TIOAV contain
TDOAV
. All we know is that TIOAV isâ€¦ infinite. Itâ€™s not eternal per se, but its existence has been infinite. Itâ€™s been always existing yet there have been plenty of things that have been existing before it. TIOAV has infinite power sourced from
TDOAV
, which props it up and makes the shell very unliveable near it due to the effects of such an amount of power in a shell.
