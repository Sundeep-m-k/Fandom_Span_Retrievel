Oklahoma Mesons are particles composed of
hadron-compatible
primordium sigma
(Σ
H+
) and a
completely stable
anticharm quark
(c̄
LΩ
). They do not decay in regular circumstances, and along with
Connecticut mesons
they form the nucleus of
thuonium
atoms.
History
[
]
Oklahoma Mesons were theorised along with Connecticut Mesons in a paper titled "On the Combinations of Mutant Particles" by
Sinari
scientist Yanau Koris in 2877. They were first created 2 months after Connecticut mesons, in the mutator particle beam FASU-B9.
