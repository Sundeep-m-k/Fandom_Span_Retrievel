Nacker is the creator of the 8 dark elements, evil, chaos, darkness, destruction, death, malovence, suffering, and vengeance. After creating the 8 dark elements he created Zalgo, the manifestation of evil who gave birth to
Chaos
, Mortus, Sombrius, Destructo and many others who are still unknown.
After nacker created Zalgo, he created his own universe known as “Warien” in that universe he created many gods, the strongest being; The Dank Jar, Greed, Rex, Zeranophonyx, Sanctus, and Lux.
Meanwhile nacker was creating more entities for his verse, that is when he realized that chaos was enslaving everyone in existence, he abandoned his Universe and fled to the far lands where he made a shop known as “Nacker’s Soup and stuff”. And that is where he met
The Seeker
and ye ye ye they both teamed up, took Chaos down and got rewarded.
Nacker came back to his verse, and realized that both Rex and Lux are dead, they were slain by a player. Nacker was fascinated in The players strength and started creating weapons and giving it out to other players, he created the chaos swords, the omega death scythes and the almighty orbs. One day, a player slayed the fragment of chaos in their universe, the final major threat in Warien.
