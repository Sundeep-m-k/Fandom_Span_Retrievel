the dinging
[
]
the way it dings is very dumb. it grabs its core and throws it at the bell which makes the bell ding.
the core of this verse is very solid and it is metal. so it can ding bells.
it has been used to ding a total of 23891471 bells so far
core
[
]
the core is the smallest thing in this verse because it is only one plank length
it is completely solid and impossible to break and people have been trying but they have not been able to do it
it is unbreakable so it can ding bells whenever it wants however it wants however hard it wants.
the material of the core
[
]
the core is made of a very strong material that is always absolute zero in temperature it is because it was absolute zero when it started and then stayed its state for the whole thing
it is made of stone
