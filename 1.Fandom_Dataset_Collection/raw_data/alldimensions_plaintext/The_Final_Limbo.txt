The
Final Limbo
is another type of verse that is on the brink of complete chaos, although entering or exiting this verse is extremely difficult. There are pockets of regularity in The Final Limbo, and each one of these is a
Final Void
. Between this is a hot soup of many random particles and some chaotic verses fill the rest of this verse.
The Soup
[
]
This hot mess of particles and verses has been coined as 'The Soup'. This is usually thought to be the most interesting part of The Final Limbo, because the particles and verses it contains are usually small (always a finite size), and also very in

and dimensionality. The barriers of the verses are very strong, because if they weren't, the temperature of The Final Limbo would destroy it. This is thought to be where the particles come from, although they are usually basic enough to not be affected that much by temperature.
Note: the exact temperature of The Final Limbo has not been measured, although it is at least 10000 degrees C. It is not recommended to traverse

Planck times (approximately 3 days), another Final Void begins forming. After around 1000

, the void finishes forming, and particles leak in and begin forming Carbites (see the page on
The Final Void
). There is about a 92% chance that it will be destroyed or shrink into one of the small verses found in The Soup when this occurs.
