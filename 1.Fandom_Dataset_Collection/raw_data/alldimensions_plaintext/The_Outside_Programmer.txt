The Outside Programmer is a controller of the
Terminal Terminal
and a servant of Melico.
Living inside of an empty space in the middle of the Terminal Terminal, he makes sure that time does not reoccur over and over again and also makes sure that small objects stay small to prevent large objects with too much simplicity and that large objects stay large to prevent small objects with too much complexity. He sometimes comments on an object that keeps appearing in the Terminal Terminal and then somehow growing larger than it even though it is just a simulation. It is theorized that this object is
The Variety
.
The Outside Programmer has been programming and maintaining the Terminal Terminal for an inconcevibaly long amount of time and, according to The Outside Programmer, the reason he can live so long is because Melico has given him a "power leaf" that granted him eternal life and lots of power. As The Outside Programmer managed and expanded the data in the Terminal Terminal he slowly gained more power through extracting certain parts of contradictory realities that were breaking his programs and absorbing them. After managing the Terminal Terminal for so long, he gained extrordinary power that was enough to destroy

in under an hour. The reason that The Outside Programmer has not taken to destroying massive chunks of reality like this is because Melico would kill him if he did.
