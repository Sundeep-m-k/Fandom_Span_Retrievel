Chaos and order
, like a
law
, is not a physical object, but unlike laws,
it is not real in the form of separate information
, but rather it is a consequence of disorder, or lack thereof, of information.
An area of space is more chaotic, if more reactions / processes / phenomena are happening
by quantity and type
, and if the area of space has qualities one might consider
“extreme”
. An area of space is considered more orderly if it possesses characteristics opposite of a chaotic space,
in other words, if it is “calmer”.
In essence, it is similar to entropy, but does not quantify microstates.
When an area of space is chaotic enough, under most sets of laws,
“chaos particles”
start to form
(the word “particle” here doesn’t mean that they are all particles. They can be waves, beams, forces, deformations, etc, they go under some common name)
. These “particles” aren’t one type of particle, but an uncountable amount of differing particles which all have in common two things; being that they arise from chaotic systems, and groups under areas of influence share common characteristics due to the laws that govern them.
Order plays a big factor too. As large amounts of chaos provide many smaller-scaled interactions and reactions capable of producing many outcomes, order allows slow and much larger events to occur that chaos wouldn’t be able to naturally make
, if there wasn’t an exceptionally large amount of it in one place for incredibly long times causing many unintended consequences later in time.
It is by order, that previously chaotic systems get arranged into patterned systems that can sustain themselves for indefinite periods of time.
