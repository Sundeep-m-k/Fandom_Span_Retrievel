]
The Black Realm is reported to be entirely black on the inside. It is unknown if The Black Realm is completely empty, as no one has actually went inside The Black Realm. Just like The White Realm, The Black Realm is missing a lot of properties, such as its dimensionality, Kardashev Scale, shape, life percentage, and EUSI.
