Hypercompressed Universes are
Universes
which have been compressed by a
Hypercompresser
. They are often used for studying
Law Gradiency
and how different laws interact with each other. They have also been used to generate infinite power via conflicting laws of force and motion, such as the Hypercompressed Universe having laws that say every action has an equal and opposite reaction and the outside universe having laws saying that all actions have an equal (and not opposite) reaction, which would generate infinite pressure. Universe collecters commonly use Hypercompressed Universes to make their large collection eaiser to keep track of, contain, and maintain. Hypercompressed Universes are common fuel for small machines which require lots of power.
