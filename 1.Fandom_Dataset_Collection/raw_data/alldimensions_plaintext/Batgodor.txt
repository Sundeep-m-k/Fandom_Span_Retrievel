Goals
To become powerful and important in his species
Species
Bat like cosmic entities
Batgodor
is a member of the
Bat like cosmic entities
which
Batros
and
The Bat-GOD
are a part of.
He is starting to become notable that other bat like cosmic entities, are noticing his presence. He has created the
Batgodorin
Civilization native to the sentient planet
Batgodori
that he created in an act of boredom and to prove he can be important and worth talking to as a member of their species.
He also knows
Batros
on a somewhat friendly level, they have even worked together to imprison, defeat or conquer several cosmic beings around their own power level. Batgodor is also known to be quite disconnected and sort of isolated from his fellow bat like cosmic entities.
He has even entered the
Citadel of the Bat Entities
in an attempt to become even more powerful in his species. However, his attempts have been ignored or made fun of by the members of the council who run the Citadel whenever he visits in his attempts. It does get quite annoying for him to deal with.
