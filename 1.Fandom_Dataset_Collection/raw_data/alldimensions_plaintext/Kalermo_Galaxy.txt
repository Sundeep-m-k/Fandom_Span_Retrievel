Stellar Composition
[
]
the Kalermo Galaxy is 56.7% filled with Cold Stars, while 23.6% of which are (Positive) Main Sequence Stars and 19.7% of which are brown dwarfs to dark blue dwarfs.
Compounds/Elements Found on Kalermo Galaxy
[
]
Here are the Compounds or Elements found/discovered on the Kalermo Galaxy.
Affrionium
[
]
an Element first detected on a Protoplanetary disk in a star in the Kalermo Galaxy, by the RMTO. It appears blue, and they are very valuable since they emit a type of energy that is electric and it is very similar to vibranium.
Affrionium Buckyballs
[
]
Affrionium Buckyballs are very similar to Buckyballs, mentioned in the name, Affrionium Buckyballs has the same structure as Carbon Buckyballs, having 60 Affrionium Atoms arranged in a hollow sphere, it resembles a football, it is very Superconductive, they are also found in Protoplanetary Disks.
Shiftium
[
]
Shiftium is a rare element found mostly in the Accretion disks of the Kalermo Galaxy's CBH. Shiftium is very special, an object made of Shiftium, like Shiftiats can shapeshift due to the special properties of Shiftium, in the Nucleus, there is a special Baryon called "Shifton Baryons" which have quarks that has the same name "Shiftons", which alters the properties of the Entire atom, and the entire object., there is a 10% chance a Shiftium might permanently shapeshift into a Sentient species (any type of species, it can even make custom species)
Ores Found on Kalermo Galaxy
[
]
here are types of crystals or ores found in the Kalermo Galaxy.
Affrionite
[
]
a Crystal/ore found in outer space, made of Affrionium, this ore is very similar to a Vibranium, and they are commonly found in Protoplanetary disks.
Akalagnite
