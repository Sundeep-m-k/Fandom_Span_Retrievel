The "Hyper Francoverse" is a parallel dimension of the Multiverse. It is formed by 100 universes (everyone of them is called
Francoverse
); they form an enormous knight called "Big Franco". There's a lot of  apparently free space in the Hyper Francoverse, but in reality it is partially occupied by another cosmic creature called "Nunno". "Nunno" is the biggest enemy of "Big Franco".
