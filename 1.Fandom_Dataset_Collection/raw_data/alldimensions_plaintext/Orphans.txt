Introduction
[
]
An orphaned planet
The
orphans
are
planets
that have been ejected from their local
universes
, mainly because of
black holes
transporting them to their outsides.
They just float around in between universes unless they have been captured by the gravity of one of the latter.
Orphans are even capable of forming systems of planets. This usually happens when brown dwarfs reach this area and transform into red dwarf
stars
, which then tend to gather planets, which may or may not end up developing
life
.
