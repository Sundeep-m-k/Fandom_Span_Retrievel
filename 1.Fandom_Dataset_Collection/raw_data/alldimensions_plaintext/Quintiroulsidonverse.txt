What is the Quintiroulsidonverse?
[
]
The Quintiroulsidonverse is just the
Quadtiroulsidonverse
exactly for some reason. There is a different dimension though, it is weird. We will talk about it later.
What is the dimension like for a human?
[
]
The dimension is well, it is like a mirror but it's not. The dimension is like a sphere for some reason. But everything that exists, well does not exist, so if you try to go inside you would not exist unless you were fake and you are not fake
nothing
is fake
. Nothing can be in here unless if you do you do space time will loop and of course you will be in
Verseuni
.
Does time work like in
Quadtiroulsidonverse
?
[
]
It might or might not but it is not known for well
forever.
Because you go to
Verseuni
instantly it is not known. So this is the end of the thing but we know one thing though, By looking at it (because the Quadtiroulsidon verse is weird and you can see it) it looks like well, it does probably. So that is the real end
for now.
