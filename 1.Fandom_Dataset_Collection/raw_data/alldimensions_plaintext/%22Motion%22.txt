motion
Motion, the force that allows everything to move, it's how space expands, gravity works and how the flow of time continues, without it we would be frozen and that is extremely bad since your bloodstream, oxygen, atoms, everything of you has to move, and without motion, you would be dead and cease to exist, Motion is FUNDAMENTAL to
everything
, it's how things fall, people walk, cats jump, it's all motion, The Earth is spinning at 1670 kilometres per hour and you don't even realize it, without
gravity
(part of motion)  we would be thrown off the earth and anything not attached to bedrock would be thrown off the earth too but this doesn't happen because gravity and because motion, if you think, that's your neurons sending electrical signals which move so that means you literally need motion to think, to move, to fight, to love, to do everything, you need motion, it is so needed by every force, it's the most important force ever, infact you have to MOVE to do force, even teleporting is moving, doesn't matter if you're beyond speed itself, you're still
moving
in some way, as it is said: "Motus est claves et portae omnium rerum" ("Movement is the key and gate to all things.")
