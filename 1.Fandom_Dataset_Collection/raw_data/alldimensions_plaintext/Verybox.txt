The
Verybox
is yet another box in the seemingly endless amount.
There really isn't anything special about the Verybox, but it is the largest box in the
Boxbox
.
It has its own gravity even though it is a cube, and this is because the corners are just "extensions" to the sphere. The entire thing, however, is just made of gas.
Anything you can think of is most likely inside the Verybox, but that doesn't mean it contains everything. Most things at this point are unthinkable anyway.
