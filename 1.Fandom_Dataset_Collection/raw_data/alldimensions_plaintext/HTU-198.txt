HTU-198
is an individual
Universe
in
our
Multiverse
; It is considered to have one of the highest temperatures in it. It is also a pretty dense Universe, and is very far from
ours
, being about 50,622,000,000 ly away.
HTU-198
shares some properties with our Universe though, like the dimensionality and the Kardashev Scale.
Some of the other strange properties of
HTU-198
are that it can transform a Sphere to a Truncated Cuboctahedron. The barrier protects and keeps the Universe safe.
Trivia
[
]
It has bigger
galaxies
than our Universe, ~1000x bigger on average in fact!.
The galaxies are crowded together, and the space between them is small, which is one of the reasons for the high temperature of HTU-189. Because of this, it also has higher radiation doses.
This Universe was formed through a Big Bang, like ours.
Its LNB is (1,1,3) or (2,2,4)
The universe is so hot, it makes other universes in the HTU-Cluster hotter than it should be, it also contributes to 10
-50
° hotter on our Universe than it should be.
