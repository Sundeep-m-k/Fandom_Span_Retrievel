An average Warpasum.
A
Warpasum
or "The Infinite Divine YaYs" (TIDY) is a subspecies of
Yayversians
, these yayversians or Warpasum have beyond infinite power, intelligence, speed, durability, and basically anything.
A Warpasum's most creative power is its imagination (similar to an
Alphasm
). For example, our local Warpasum imagined tons of verses from the first two
Hiera
rchies
(which are our local ones).
A Warpasum's appearance is seen in the image of this article, which is basically a bluish sky-like cosmic space of infinite size with a bright white light at the middle. Warpasums' strength varies on each individual, ranging from being able to destroy infinite
class 22
verses
up to
class 32
ones. The only way for a Warpasum to be created is via a
Polyasm
(Alphasm,
Betasm
, etc.) consuming a
Sarpy Shard
. The stronger the Polyasm that consumed them is, the stronger the resulting Warpasum becomes. Polyasms that are TOO powerful wont get transformed by the Shards, though.

Warpasum is one of the most powerful voids, because it is only 0.00001% matter, and the 'matter' is just letters. Fill in the void by
