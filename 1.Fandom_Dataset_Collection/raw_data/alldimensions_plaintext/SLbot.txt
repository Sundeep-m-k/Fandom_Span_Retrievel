An SLbot (Prob Pay Prow in
The Pencil Language
), who's full name is Special Labor Bot, is a multipurpose
Utilibot
which can do everything that the
Sealbot
,
Salbot
,
Stealbot
, and
Eelbot
can do
and a few special abilities.
SLbots
aren't used much, as they are much harder to produce than even a
Salbot
, although there are situations where a SLbot is the best Utilibot to use.
SLbots, just like the
Eelbot
,
can change shape, bend, and deform extensively, allowing them to squeeze through tight/narrow areas
. However, an SLbot's default shape is still a cube. SLbots have over 50 arms, all of which can change size and shape.
Slbots have
a weirdly transparent exterior
. This transparency does not let you actually see the inside of the SLbot.
SLbots are frequently used as a bot for powerful entities, as SLbots are very well-rounded.
Much fewer SLbots have been produced than the other bots, with only 10,532,342 ever being produced.
A few of the SLbot's special abilities include:
communicating in an intelligent fashion with other robots/organic lifeforms
teleporting short distances
manipulating a few fundamental forces of spacetime, such as gravity, heat, and momentum
The SLbot was rated a 13/16 by
