The
omni gardens
are unattainable and absolute places, being the original primidial of everything. They contain waterfalls, but these dont have your average type of water. This water... its temperature...... its crazy. The issue isnt even that its temperature is extremly high or low, but because of something in their composition that makes them distorted on a conceptual level, having their properties altered each
voidsecond
in unpredictable patterns, the temperature not even being the only issue.
