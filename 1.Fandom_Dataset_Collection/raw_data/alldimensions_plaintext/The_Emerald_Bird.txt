Power
[
]
The Emerald Bird is only nigh-omnipotent since it has limits (for example, it can't escape from
The Ball of The Existence
). it can eat virtually everything, from TREEYUM to even
Defiled Universes
. It can also travel extremely long distances very fast. It has also been known to eat cosmic entities, most notably the
Panomni Gods
. Many of the creatures inside
The Other Room
fear The Emerald Bird. The Emerald Bird sometimes emits a ridiculously high-pitched noise to distract its prey. This has proven to be very helpful for The Emerald Bird.
Encounters with That Human
[
]
Once, when That Human was about to eat
The Fried Egg
, The Emerald Bird came out through a wormhole over to The Other Room see what was going on. That was the first time That Human saw The Emerald Bird.
Over time, That Human grew more hostile towards The Emerald Bird, and later got into a full-fledged fight with each other. The Emerald Bird injured That Human and retreated back into The Ball of The Existence.
The Emerald Bird would never step foot in The Other Room again.
