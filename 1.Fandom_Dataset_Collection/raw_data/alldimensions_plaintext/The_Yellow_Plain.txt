The
Yellow Plains
are the fourth verses of the
color plain chain
. They're one of the least interesting plains, and not even their color is that interesting.
Why is this plain so boring?
[

Because they have the same properties of the
White Plains
, but a lot bigger and shinier.  We can also say that they have a lot of unknown lifeforms, like what happens with the
Orange Plains
.
