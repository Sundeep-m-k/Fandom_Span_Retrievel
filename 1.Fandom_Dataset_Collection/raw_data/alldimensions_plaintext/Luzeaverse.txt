is a super rare kind of verse. This is because the speed of light in this verse is smaller than the maximum speed in this verse. Light in this verse travels at 76.9 million ly/s, and the maximum speed is 53.3 trillion ly/s. This verse only appears in
TREEVERSES
, and there are only

of these types of this verse in the nearest TREEVERSE.
It is theorized that there are verses contained solely by the Omniverse that have a finite light speed but have infinite cosmological limit. These verses are called
Hyperluzeaverses
.
