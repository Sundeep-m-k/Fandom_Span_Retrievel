Universal Transportation Ship
Traveling through its local universe.
Speed
27.05 trillion ly/sec, 0.3 milliseconds per universe
Size
Boeing 747

Slower than
Gigaversal Transportation Ship
Universal Transportation Ship
is the most primitive technology to be able to cross
Universes
, which can be constructed by
sub-Multiversal
civilizations with basic
Imaginary Transfutation
skills. You can find these ships at
Nexus Cubes
, or the construction site from any
Imaginary Cubes
.
This ship can zoom across
Universes
in minutes on general usages. And at peak, it can go ~ 27.05 trillion ly/second, around 3.907
Quettameters
per second. It can also go as slow as 10 feet per hour, so it makes a great commercial vehicle, being only as big as the average plane.

Although, all post-universal transportation ships are cuboid, it is a cube! It also comes with a bathroom, being the best part. At least until
Cetaversal Transportation Ship
.
