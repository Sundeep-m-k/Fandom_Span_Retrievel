The
Magma Centrals
are used to keep the warmest
realms
,
galaxies
and more, mostly
Stars
.
The Warmest Realm a Magma Central can contains is a
Magma Realm
. These are the warmest centrals in their entire
Alphasms
. When entities try to explore one of these, they'll burn (size of a Magma central in LY × ♾) away from the centrals, and the heat increases exponentially when you get closer.
