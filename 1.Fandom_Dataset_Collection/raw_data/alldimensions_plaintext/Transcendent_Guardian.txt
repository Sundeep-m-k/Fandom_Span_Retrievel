The Transcendent Guardian
is an entity that guards the gate between the
Nightmare Universe
and the
Nightmare Multiverse
. The transcendent guardian is only seen when one overcomes their fears in the
Terror Zone
and is proven worthy to move on, and the Transcendent Guardian opens the gate to the next verse.
