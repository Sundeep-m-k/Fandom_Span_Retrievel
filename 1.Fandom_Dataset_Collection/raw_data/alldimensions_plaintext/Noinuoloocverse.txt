[
]
There are 3 known weird properties. The 1st property is Light. Light is a particle and a wave, but in the 6th Dimension it, has another property, it is a particle and a wave, but it is also an orbiter. Light particles orbit a single Kiloromo. The Kiloromo is a really fast particle that spreads light away and makes it go fast enough that it makes a rainbow. Temperature also affects light in effect of the Kiloromo. When the light is getting cold it makes purple, blue, and green. When it is hotter it makes yellow, orange and red. The 2nd property is the void. It is a void with unexplainable light. The 3rd property is light that makes a rainbow are actually big
