Computers of eternity
and other irrelevant prototypes of them.
The
Computer of eternity corporation headquarters
(Or
COE corp HQs
) are huge skyscraper with strange colors. They have lots of computers, including the
computers of eternity
.
The other computers are smaller versions of the eternity ones or, in some cases, prototypes of more complexs versions of them.
The average number of computers in these places remains unknown, but it's somewhere between 5 million and 8 million.
The level of technology they have is huge, proven by the potential of a single computer of eternity. Meanwhile, if a prototype is successful, it could dwarf the capabilities of the formers.
The creator of the COE corps remains unknown, but of course it is (or they are, in case theres many of them) one of the smartest cosmic entities of all, if not the smartest.
