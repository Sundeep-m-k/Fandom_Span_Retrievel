the lord of lords is confirmed to be defeatable(which is just a different view from a angle
I AM ALL
—
The Lord of Lords
UNDEFEATABLE (except for the
true god
and his
little brother
, since they're pretty literally the creators of everything, they can delete him nah just kidding the Lord of Lords could easily wipe them out, in fact hes so good at killing people he can kill himself with his mind but... oh no, that makes him DEFEATABLE!!!!!!!)
The Lord of Lords is The Creator of all Lord Stickmen(
Light
,
Darkness
,
Evil
,
Good
,
Time
and many other)
He ascends the transcendence of ascending beyond concepts, it is USELESS to give him a infobox because he will break the literal infobox,
How old is he?: well The Lord of Lords is Soo old he is basically before the
omniversal calender
,
Appearance: even tho you can just look at the image literally Infront of you I'll break it down for yall
Basically he is a stickmen who is maybe rainbow????? And he sits on cool chair and he has a green crown with three purple infinites to symbolize Infinity, Transfinity, Hyperfinity,
he
also
solos
all
(don't forget the exceptions! theres exceptions)
Note
[

The almighty
could be the long lost cousin of this creature. So unlike the “he also solos all” part, they could be the same strength or one of them is stronger. + the wouldn’t fight
