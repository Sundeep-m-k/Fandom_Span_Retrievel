The
Scissors
are one of the few
structures
known to be capable of splitting
Papers
without being WAY stronger than them (example: being part of a
higher class
). They're found on
Tables
, along with
Papers
,
Apples
,
Erasers
and
Pencils
.
Properties
[
]
The Scissors are made of some of the strongest metal alloys powerful enough to split Papers without being destroyed. Design-wise they pretty much look like normal scissors, with two ring-like structures attached to them. In the shown image they're depicted as blue, however their actual color is impossible to perceive, as such it can be interpreted as any color on one's visible spectrum. On the opposite side, they have two blades connected by a rotating point.
Weaknesses
[
]
The Scissors, while being completely effective against the Papers, are vulnerable to
the Rocks
, as they cannot counter their raw power. One must also note that Papers are capable of neutralizing Rocks, making a cycle composed of "Rock", "Paper" and "Scissors".

This whole thing is outdated and untrue since Rocks are way larger and of a higher dimensionality than both Scissors and Papers, meaning Rocks are above both.
