The

Who rules over this verse?
[
]
A entity called Dylan rules over this verse although he also maniaclly laughs (of excitement) for some random reason which we don't know of.
Who can he beat?
[
]
He does not beat up cosmic entities for bad just to flex and have fun.
IRL
Humans
(
TOG
) are obviously erased of course.
He can also punch
The Creator
and
The Destroyer
Of course he can erase
Bongus
and
Chunky Cheese
who do you think I am a idiot?!
Gerald
couldn't beat Dylan but they both went into their most powerful form it would be a tie
Alphasm
and
Dunkey kong
could not last a planck time if they fought with Dylan.
The Nirvanian
... oh boy now this is going to be a tough one, The way to explain it is kind of like a board game sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. So if they fighted they would have had the same amount of points.
Really any entity can be destroyed by Dylan, but not
Jerald
.
What verses can he defeat?
[
]
Again he does not beat verses for bad again to flex and have fun.
Universe
.. ok this is 10000000% not fair he would just not bother because everyone knows he can destroy a
Universe
and plus it is too small and tiny for him. :(
Omniverse
ok I think pretty much every god can at least destroy a
Omniverse
... so why should he not?
He can also destroy
The Chicken
and turn him into FRIED chicken and then he eats him alive and he dies.
He can also destroy any verse in
The Generic Hierarchy
He cant destroy
