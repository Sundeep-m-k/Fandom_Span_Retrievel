The
True Impossible
is a verse that is packed with LOTS of
Paradoxical Infinities
and is the shape of a sphere.
It's called the true impossible because
TOG
Rwa54r
took the name "The Impossible" as a former name for the
Cuhabsoverseverse
and reality did not let
TOG
BestNoobReborn
use the name "The Impossible" for his new verse to surround the endless void beyond the Paradoxical Infinity. TOG Rwa54r was informed that the Cuhabsoverseverse would be dwarfed by the Paradoxical Infinity and the Cuhabsoverseverse would have to be converted into void. Rwa54r accepted, and the Cuhabsoverseverse was converted into void and the True Impossible was made.
Its existence level is NaN and it sits on top of the
Endless Perch
.
