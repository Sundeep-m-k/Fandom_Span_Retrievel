is a verse which is ridiculously big, even bigger than
The Exponentiality of all Verses
! It is impassable, so impassable it’s beyond impasability. TIOAV has many layers, each being more impassible than the last. Its size is Ω

as well. So, first we'll discuss, what's with the ☒
1
? Well, this symbol (☒) symbolises impassibility. You truly cannot pass it. ☒
1
would be level 1 impassible, still vastly impassible, but remember, only the first layer.
Every subsequent number is more impassibility, so ☒
[#]
is basically every impassible tier, the [#] being the layer, as they go on FOREVER.
TEOAV
doesn’t scratch the surface of even the first loop, and every subsequent layer is filled with more and more copies of the previous TIOAV layer. Is there a final layer? No. Is there a sort of break? No. Even if you somehow escaped
TEOAV
and are able to escape infinite layers, even if you had true loopbreaking technology for M10s, nah, it wouldn’t work. The Impassiblity covers all alternate planes. The only way to get out to to keep breaking, keep going, FOREVER, until TIOAV itself dies, which will be in BEYOND FOREVER YEARS!
Just enough time to wait for Portal 3 to release.
