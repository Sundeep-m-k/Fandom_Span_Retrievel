The GLOTO (The Great Library of the Omniverse) is the largest library / collection of works / list of sources known in this Realm.
The GLOTO contains, very roughly, about 12 decillion objects in its system, which include: documents, files, books, research papers, photographs, galleries, pacts, declerations, maps, blueprints, logs, experiment results, recipes, dictionaries, manifestos, notes, charts and much more.
All of these are for research purposes, containing all scientific knowledge, from total basics to the most modern advancements, full history of our Realm, histories of individual civilizations and their sciences, as well as politics.

Every single civilization known to exist in the Omniverse has a book written on them, or is mentioned in detail in a collection of civilizations. This is possible, because of the simple fact, that while there is an infinite amount of Universes in our Omniverse, there are only a finite amount of civilizations.
Alongside every civilization being included, their respective home Archverses (not just Universes, due to the advanced ones) are deconstructed down to the bone, sometimes even having an entirely seperate work about them, thanks to their complexity.
The foundational, introductory, advanced, expert and experimental texts of everything from the most basic forms of mathematics, geometry, topology, set theory, sub-mathematics, biology, science, existology, and much more, from Realm-wide to Universe-specifc variants, can be found here
