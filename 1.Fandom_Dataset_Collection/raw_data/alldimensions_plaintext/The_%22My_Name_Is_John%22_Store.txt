The
"My Name Is John" Store
is a store that sells items in exchange for a small amount of the buyer's currency exchange. The store is sentient. Because I said so.
The store LOVES to eat the remains of the passengers that accidentally fall off the public transit on the way to it. It brings healthy amounts of dopamine to The "My Name Is John" Store's brain. It has a brain, for some reason. But then, if this happens, it takes the public transit necessary to get to The "My Name Is John" Store and then throws it all the way to Guangzhou, China. Depends on the latitude. Although, if a parabolic motion is not sufficient for a public transit to be thrown to Guangzhou, the store will just throw the transit into the middle of Tristan da Cunha.
It was where the Director of Johnhos went to have a super funny auditorium talk in front of millions of radiohead fans. Oh boy oh boy, what fun! Sadly, The "My Name Is John" Store accidentally took the wrong turn and went to the Director and ate off all of its horn blowers. Aw, shucks! Such a tragedy. This will be remembers for thousands of years.
Anyway, The "My Name Is John" Store sells a lot of items, such as:
Nut-free salted peanuts. In case you really really love salted peanuts but are all allergic to them, do not have fear! These nut-free salted peanuts will be sure to quench your hunger in seconds. Works great with pepper.
Milk Toast paint will be sure to be a great way to build your fort. It's butter, but the same thing.
The "My Name Is John" Store has Big Dingdong Duncans! they do not exist in real life, but you can buy them at Walmart. Feel free to ask a committee if you feel concerned, or if you are not happy with your purchase. We supply 24/7 customer service to all customers, regardless of head height or yogurt-eating abilities.
You can make sure to buy the Entire country of Spain! It is free, for every customer. We are currently having a 50% off sale of it, so make sure to buy it while the sale lasts! It won't last forever! But you must pay if you want to donate.
I added a really awesome looking bathroom to The "My Name Is John" Store if you want to check it out. It contains 15 different toilets and a ton of clip-on can holsters for you to try! They were all manufactured by the Global International National Intermission Committee Organization (GINICO). To access it, you must collect all 7 infinity stones, which can be found in World 2 of the game. Just press pause and exit the game to enter World 2.

The "My Name Is John" Store used to not exist. But then, suddenly, it started existing! How awesome! After this, it started eating up all of the land it had available. Which is, all of the land. Until The "My Name Is John" Store became Massive! But unfortunately, it had a dire consequence.
The evil Mack Burger got So mad at The "My Name Is John" Store that they created an awesome program using JavaScript Version 63 and banished The "My Name Is John" Store to the top of a hillless mountain! Oh crap! Whatever will we ever do! The mountain considered stopping the usage of the land it is on, but never did. So The "My Name Is John" Store had to remain on the mountaintop for as long as I can remember. But fortunately, the Evil Dish-Doer Of The Camera Person's Biggest Pharmaceutical chucked The "My Name Is John" Store all the way to the British Empire! Oh, wait, the british empire was everywhere, so they were already in the british empire, even before they got chucked. So The "My Name Is John" Store was chucked into the middle of nowhere!
There was a path, so the "My Name Is John" Store followed it and there was a cool restaurant at the end. Then the "My Name Is John" Store went over and asked for a beer, but it was too expensive. So they asked for a jar of honey pickles instead and it was cheaper so the "My Name Is John" Store got it and ate it all. And then the "My Name Is John" Store ate the jar because it was too large for school. Speaking of school, the "My Name Is John" Store went to school after that and it was Too Intelligent so the "My Name Is John" Store got kicked out for being too awesome for the school.
Then the "My Name Is John" Store went to the farm farm. A farm that makes farms. The farms that are made by the farm are also farms, and they're placed on farmland. But not the farmland that contains the original farm farm, which is the farm that makes the farms. A farm is not to be confused with a Juicerwater13's Underwater Graham Cracker.
The farm farm sent the "My Name Is John" Store all the way back to the original location it was at! Woohoo! Yippee! Hooray! Then it started eating all of the shirts of the customers that went there. Yummy! But then, the terrifying Chewing ChooChoo Train came up to the "My Name Is John" Store. And the Chewing ChooChoo Train told the "My Name Is John" Store that the "My Name Is John" Store was going to be eaten by the Chewing ChooChoo Train! But they were wrong so the Chewing ChooChoo Train went back home and played video games all day. But at least it smells good, so that's fine.
After that, the "My Name Is John" Store set up a parking lot outside the house. The person who owned the house said "Your Not Allow To Be On My Propper Tee"! But the "My Name Is John" Store told them to Shut Up and it built the parking lot anyway. The parking lot had a sign that says "Illegally Parked Cars Will Be Fined" but somebody removed the last D on the sign to say "Illegally Parked Cars Will Be Fine" so now all cars get parked illegally in the parking lot but the "My Name Is John" Store doesn't care because the "My Name Is John" Store is too cool for that.
Then another sign was added that says "Eating On The Elevator And Monkeys In The Refrigerator To Eat Chips And Cheerioes". This sign was eventually destroyed because somebody threw an apple to the window and air resistance caused some parts of the window to go out and crush the sign. Now the sign is used as a juice box, to drink juice from.
Today, the "My Name Is John" Store sits in a big cupboard for people to go up to it and buy stuff. But the "My Name Is John" Store is sentient and always says stuff to encourage people to do exercise more often. It is necessary.

Why. Do I have to explain the appearance. You can see it in the image. That's the appearance. No need to use text. All words are invented by humans. You're reading a bunch of squiggles and understanding them. Good job, comedian.

The "My Name Is John" Store appears in every single episode of Pleasantly And Their Friends Show Channel On Television Show Broadcast Show. Such as the one where they throw an orange at the egg and the egg cracks and explodes everywhere. This is because the "My Name Is John" Store is everywhere, right now. This was not always the case but they ate too much land so now it exists. Also, the "My Name Is John" Store appears at all times, even in the credits! That's because the "My Name Is John" Store is too awesome and I want it to appear in every episode at all times. Hooray! It also appears in the part where they go to the different types of blueberries on a farm. Counting eggs on a farm for kids.
It even appears when the person is not watching the show! Because the "My Name Is John" Store is too awesome of a store. I love the "My Name Is John" Store.

The "My Name Is John" Store really dislikes when people eat too much cheetos. The cheetos are so bad that they accidentally misplaced my chair! I had to look for over twenty years since the dark dark days of being a factory worker. And I still can't find it! It's in the closet. But I have to say, the battle scenes were absolutely thrilling. It made me want more of that. If I were to suggest one thing to be added to the "My Name Is John" Store, it would be to have even more thrilling battle scenes for me to enjoy! I want to watch those in the "My Name Is John" Store while eating chocolate pudding. The "My Name Is John" Store dislikes when people eat cheetos, but the "My Name Is John" Store also dislikes when ham is encouraged.
The "My Name Is John" Store does not like green doorknobs! They are so disgusting that they once turned Walmart into a college for around three minutes. Nobody likes colleges! Everyone likes walmart! So nobody likes the green doorknobs. Not even the "My Name Is John" Store.
