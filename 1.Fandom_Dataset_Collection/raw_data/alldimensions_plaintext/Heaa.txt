Heaas
are absolutely miniscule verses, even smaller than
Hekks
. While only 23 Heaas in our local
Box
have been properly observed, it's likely that quadrillions (or even more) of them exist even in a single
Heck
.
While some Heaas are found inside Hekks, most of them are floating throughout space, usually at extremely fast speeds. Like Hekks,
Heccs
, and Hecks, Heaas are constantly shrinking, making it impossible to determine their true size. This also makes them extremely difficult to observe and photograph.
From the Heaas observed, the majority appeared to have glowing objects inside of them. These have been found to be an even smaller type of verse, now named
Hebbs
.
