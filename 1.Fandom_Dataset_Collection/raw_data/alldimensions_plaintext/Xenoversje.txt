A xenoversje (xeno (foreigner) + verse (container) + je (small)) is a versje containing an entirety of space. It may be divided up into an infinite amount of
oikoversjes
or it may be one whole.
Like all versjes, xenoversje have an infinite amount of properties and any xenoversje's properties will be that of our own unless otherwise specified.

A xenoversje has the same fundamental physics in its entirety, allowing traversal of fundamental particles along the entirety of space. Since other xenoversjes have different fundamental physics, particles cannot traverse between them so all xenoversjes with different fundamental physics are detached from eachother. All xenoversjes with the same fundamental physics are contained in one
omniversje
.
Emergent properties

After a long time, all
oikoversjes
will have merged through false vacuum decay. This is called true vacuum death, where the entirety of a xenoversje is a true vacuum. Infinite xenoversjes cannot achieve this, as there will always be a
oikoversje
big enough to not completely have been overtaken by false vacuum decay due to the nature of infinity.

Curvature
[
]
Most xenoversjes are infinite due to their curvature being either zero or negative. In order to have a finite xenoversje, there are two methods. The first is if its curvature is positive, thus giving the space a sort of spherical shape. The second is by looping space in all directions, thus giving the space a sort of torus shape.
Simulations
[
]
Only finite xenoversjes can be simulated, but even this is extremely difficult. This is because xenoversjes can contain all P-types, making it very hard to simulate or even design the simulation in the first place. It is therefore reccomended to not try to simulate a xenoverse in real-time or to only simulate a small finite xenoverse.
