smol kitten!! the most powerful being ever!!!!!!! he can destroy a omni-infinite amount of the true omniverse, he is beyond true boundlessnesspotence and solos 100% of all fiction and real life itself!! and! "Wait does he actually have that much power or are you just giving him top cat status" well... Uhhhh (crap how do I describe a godmode Entity in all dimensions terms)
Place on the cosmic entity hireachy(lower than GOD on the undefinable tier, maybe lower)
Yeah he's actually not that powerful, he's just a evil meta-being who somehow transcendend fiction
