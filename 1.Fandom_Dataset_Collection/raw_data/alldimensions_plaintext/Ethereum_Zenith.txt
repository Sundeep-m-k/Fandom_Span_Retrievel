Ethereum Zenith majorly stores a pure substance named Prismize, alone a mere milligram of it towards a base level universe can create the purest colors and most dangerous amounts of light. To our planet, it can be valued at around 872,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (872 septillion) per milligram due to this very substance being the very thing that makes up all colors and light in almost everything. Alone, a Yellow Dwarf Star contains around 0.008 milligrams of Prismize that helps give its radiant glow, whilst a normal planet contains a mere fraction of that, at around 0.000000000072301 milligrams of Prismize to enlighten a planet.
Inside of the place filled with the Prismize is chunks of the essence of it floating around the place. The hierarchy of Prismize objects is below.
- Atomic Scaled Prismize (the lowest amount of Prismize that can be contained at once before convulsing into a supernova level explosion.)
- Prismize (At this form, Prismize is equal to a normal gemstone of pure radiant light that can blind planets at once if not Solar Systems.)
- Ascended Prismize (Ascended Prismize is made up of millions of chunks of Prismize, being sizes of planets on a normal universal scale. These can emit light to vaporize pure galaxies. Prismize stars at built upon this level, and supernova of these stars are extremely deadly to a universe. They shine brighter then some universes even.)
- Iueka Prismize (This form of Prismize is a type that is made up of well, millions of Ascended Prismize, and trillions of Prismize alone. It scales quickly upon Galactic scales and large amount of Prismize aren't balled. Instead, it spreads into dust around the major Iueka Prismize that witholds Ascended and such Prismize below.)
- Opia Prismize (One of the final forms of Prismize, this making up of millions of Iueka Prismize and so on. These chunks are sizes of universes already, their very essence of light and colors being indescriable to this point. A normal mortal won't even have a presence of viewing such a thing even from the safest distance possible.)
- Prismon (The highest hierarchy of Prismize. The size of this is truly unknown, but it makes up all of the Ethereum Zenith, creating all light everywhere and colors.)
- Every Color (It basically just has infinite colors in here. No end. Although finding every color here would be almost impossible, there is time here where you would eventually find most.)

"This place is filled of pure light majorly and rainbows, ascending the very concepts of mortal to a whole new level. It makes up the very watercolors and such of almost everything below it, creating the very basics of colors such as RGB, whilst being an ethereal place of wonders to view and seek. People who visit this place may be gifted a chance of pure power that ascends a multiversal god, but those without a proper care or heart shall be frozen into pure prismize."
The Ethereum Zenith is a place that withholds the substance of everything. This place is equal to almost every dimension if not every possible dimension and is on par towards the omniverse if not higher. This place is not precisely a universe but can be set close enough towards one. The main purpose of the Ethereum Zenith is to be the gateway of every color and fraction of light among the universes and beyond, excluding places without any colors at all or light. Voids like in our universe are a separate concept and are still an institution of black that the Ethereum Zenith withholds. Although places without color are just black, that is since that place isn't affected by Ethereum Zenith at all.
This place isn't much of all powerful, life being present or not is merely inconceivable. Alone, even centillions times the distance from this object won't clear it out of view in the void of space as it shines so radiant, it burns brighter than anything else almost. The Ethereum Zenith can be destroyed indeed, but almost impossible to do so as if this place even is destroyed, all colors everywhere will be rid of, leaving not even a monotone gray and white.
Just black void.
But, destroying the Ethereum Zenith won't be possible either way due to it being made up so much light, even for example an omniverse scaled goddess of light cannot upscale the pure light that radiates from the multiversal sized chunks of Prismize. It would just blind them to pure death, maybe.
The uniqueness of the Ethereum Zenith though comes a part of what it can do mortals, and the worth of what makes it all up.

Mortal Properties
[
]
Normal beings, not just specifying mortal humans who enter the very domain of this realm are granted usually a curse or a gift. This is not by any choice, but instead by force. During the alignment of the Prismia Ketlar, every 600 Earth Years, for one minute specifically on a random day on that year, beings throughout the omniverse and below who are mortal, and don't have any powers like others can stare upon the Ethereum Zenith. This frame allows people to stare at where it is without being blinded.
(For reference, the Ethereum Zenith can be seen through other universes and such due to its pure radiance, making it always visible. Though, the closet known celestial object to it is around...
898818.881e+255992 lightyears away.
Visiting this is almost impossible, you have to ascend beyond omnipotent speed or even creators speed. Teleportation can't even reach the bounds of this place. Therefore, you have to actually visit there by pure foot (or omnipotent speed,) or ascend the laws of reality, like
Jerald
. Very unfair.)
When people view the universe for this moment, every being with a pure heart with no evil that looks into it gain a surge of powerful energy. The wishing light befalls upon them for one wish at their pure will. Anything... will come true as they please. Beings with evil in them however (depends how much,) shall be cursed to face the form of pure Prismize multiverses inside of here, burning their very essence to dust and ashes painfully, the dust and normal atoms even burning into nothingness.)

The Ethereum Zenith is too much for one mortal to even handle. Only omnipotent gods have a chance of even entering it, and one of the more powerful omnipotent gods had entered the Ethereum Zenith, something no god ever cocky to even try to venture. The side effects were later revealed after they trekked into the glowing mass of the universe's color.
It caused the powerful god to go mentally insane in minutes and unable to escape the realm with their state. The very concept of Prismize wasn't something for one to imagine, the colors being too much for any brain to handle. They lost pure control and Prismize concealed the god into the fabric of its reality, making it one of the many
[UNKNOWN]
victims to fall to the Ethereum Zenith. The Ethereum Zenith makes the person remember their haunting past of whatever they had done, and if they are pure, they are still affected by it mentally with thoughts of their people being decimated in the most graphic ways, and themselves being put into a stasis of horror to watch it. Once you reach past the minute mark, there is no return of your world. It will consume your very being into the consciousness of the planet. This world isn't a place anymore, it knows what it does to idiots. Hence why even the strongest of all can't manipulate the laws of this place, they will be able to escape it with more than finite or infinite time but never take control of it. This place
is sentient.
omething they had brought to express what they were going to say. Video of even Kardashev 7 couldn't enter nor work here. This wasn't a place for
Gods
to travel to ever.
"WHAT HAVE I DONE TO BECOME SUCH? THE COLORS OF THE REALM EMPOWER MY VERY SELF AS I CONSUME AND DEVOUR THE VERY SANITY OF MYSELF ONE BY ONE. THE REASON WHY AM I INSANE IS BECAUSE OF THIS WORLD, I SHOULDVE LISTEN TO THEM ALL. MY PAST HAUNTS ME OF ALL THE SINS I HAD CAUSED TO THE [EXPUNGED], I WANT TO GO BACK AND CHANGE MY PAST AND MAKE SURE IT NEVER ATTACKED ME AGAIN. THE COLORS ARE BECOMING BRIGHTER AND MORE LUMINOUS, THEY ALLURE ME TO FOLLOW THEM INTO THEIR GATE OF PEACE. MY GOD LIKE WORLD IS PERFECT, BUT WHAT THEY PRESENT CAN FREE ME OF WHAT I HAD DONE TO THOSE PEOPLE OF THE OMNIVERSES, I HAD [EXPUNGED]. I SHALL RID OF MYSELF, THE REASON WHY I HAVE BECAME CRUEL WAS THAT WORLD..."
- The first, and only log of ones experience of the Ethereum Zenith.
They had spoken in pure glitches and screeches of pain, a thing an omnipotent god would not be able to feel in infinity, and the audio file glitched out so heavily and seemingly semi-corrupted before it cut off at the end. The only reason why this was even retrieved is that the data could escape the Ethereum Zenith before it too was corrupted fully.
Prismize
[
]
The purest substance that makes up all color and light. Prismize is the most valuable thing across every conceivable dimension and universe, valued by all who can even withstand it. A pure gram of Prismize is 872 octillion, worth more than a solar system (such as ours) maybe, and even a gram of Prismize can create explosions to rupture a normal scaled universe at most.
An ample was during the experiments of Prismize in a universe, it had exploded so badly that it ruptured across thousands of universes with immense luminosity intensity for years, around a 77% increase to 9% in all universes. This as a result destroyed trillions of lifeforms emerging or existing unless they had an extreme Kardashev scale.
For a civilization to use Prismize as an energy source and weaponry source, they would have to exceed on the Kardashev scale of 6.255 to get close to even handling such a materiel.
Prismize Hierarchy
[
]
Prizmise has a powerful hierarchy of scales of the substance, each million times more powerful than the other. This hierarchy can only exist in the Ethereum Zenith.
Atomic Scaled Prismize
[
]
This is the lowest amount of Prismize that can be contained before creating a supernova level explosion if mishandled. All prismize are structured via this and no other substance can be made with this. Atomically creating this even with creation powers is impossible, only extractable from the Ethereum Zenith. Each Atomic Prismize has
[UNKNOWN]
, with restrictive unknown barriers hence being the reason of making these atoms impossible. The radiation of this Prismize is equal to a city fully powered at night. Seeing these atoms are impossible as the higher hierarchies are condensed so much, one can barely view one. One of these atoms can make a luminosity of 7% of Sol.
Prismize
[
]
The purest form of Prismize currently. It is made up of millions if not billions of Atomic Prismize, and is a gemstone made up of so many radiant colors, even some that shouldn't exist. Prismize is a diamond shard spilit in half but held together by strings of energy. Prismize at this point can blind solar systems at once, and melt moons, asteroids, and planets sometimes. Its raw power is around the brightness of a galaxy on average, whilst being able to destroy galactic clusters if left unstable. But this Prismize to Multiversal+ places is an extremely valuable source of art as mthe artists there extract it very safely of any color they need of almost infinite uses. Though, you will find it extremely rarely in places from multiversal to hyperversal for proper handling.
Ascended Prismize
[
]
Ascended Prismize is millions of times greater than normal Prismize, hence why it is called Ascended Prismize, being the luminosity and power of universes, but the size is unknown at this level, but making up Prismize stars and planets. This level of prismize can wipe out a universe or severely cause unstableness towards it. Ascended Prismize's appearance can actually kill gods, handling Prismize at this level still needing Kardashev 6.255 as the rest. One recorded civilization weaponized Ascended Prismize to destroy an entire universe at their own will once.
Iueka Prismize
[
]
In Ethereum Zenith, this form of Prismize is a type that is made up of well, millions of Ascended Prismize, and trillions of Prismize alone. The size of this is galaxies if not galaxy clusters and superclusters in Ethereum Zenith, Iueka Prismize holding together Ascended and such prismize together. It creates beauitful bright and colored space dust to withold Ascended Prismize star systems, though not containing life. Iueka Prismize is so powerful that it can now get close to eradicating multiverses at once into nothing but ashes, leaving nothing to reign. Type 6.78 civilizations can handle Iueka Prismize usually.
Opia Prismize
[
]
The second strongest point of Prismize. This is made up of millions of Iueka Prismize, creating the very essence of universe inside of the Ethereum Zenith. Each of of these Opia Prizmizes contain so many galaxies and such to shine brighter than anything else now and also destroy Metaverses and higher at this point. Type 7 Civilizations can only handle such a substance, and even so, they could fail and wipe out themselves without any recovery (unless they are spread out across several metaverses and not just one.)
Prismon
[
]
Prismon. The most powerful hierarchy of Prismize. It is equal to an
[UNKNOWN]
in size whilst having power and luminosity of that to destroy and outshine small omniverses now. Handling this is impossible unless you exceed a Kardashev scale on type 8 to 9, or Omniverse levels of power, but even omniverse beings may not be able to get near a chunk of Prismon without dying or becoming one with it. All of Ethereum Zenith is made up of Prismon. How much? Maybe quadrillions, septillions, or more. But one thing for sure is that nothing can exceed this level of Prismize as of now. Prismon is the most refined and condensed form of Prismize that can currently exist, and nothing about it can be modified by gods of light of even
The Creator
, though they can handle being in the presence of it.
Ethereum Zenith
[
]
Though not a part of the hierarchy of Prismize, it is technically the final stage actually. Just made up of Prismon. This place creates all light and colors everywhere except places that are fully black. Noir color schemes such as white, gray, and such do not count as voids and are still created by the Ethereum Zenith (by their color creation, not formation
.
)
Formation

The Ethereum Zenith has no classfied formation yet. This will be answered soon.
