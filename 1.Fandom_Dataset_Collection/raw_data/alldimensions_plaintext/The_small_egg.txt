Structure
[
]
50% of this egg is the eggshell, so no random objects are in here. However, there is a spinning light in the middle of The small egg that makes strobe lights. These are slowly taking away the shell of this egg.
Water
[
]
Instead of egg whites, this egg only contains water. 61% of the egg is filled up with water, so everything that you toss in floats.
Bubbles
[
]
Since there is water, sometimes the water creates bubbles. These bubbles are strange, since they can go right through the eggshell and create objects in
The medium sized egg
. This has led people to believe that the bubbles are "building blocks" for the random things in
The medium sized egg
.
