Time and Place of Creation
Approximately 14.2 billion years ago, and a couple billion light years away from the main
Universe
.
Overview
[
]
Alternate Universe A
is a simple name given to an alternate universe, which is practically identical to the main
Universe
, although it does exist longer, is slightly longer, and has a more prosperous variant of Humans. This universe also seems to repel itself from other universe, similar to magnets. It repels the call of gravity and prevents it from
colliding with other universes
. This also makes it the only universe in the
Multiverse
to move on its own, albeit very slowly.
Appearance
[
]
Alternate Universe A has similar formations to the main Universe, harboring similar blackholes. It does have a larger blackhole than Phoenix A*, though, Phoenix B* (original name, I know). It is about 314 billion solar masses larger than Phoenix A*, and it is perfectly in the center of Alternate Universe A, allowing for some odd spectacles if you manage to witness it. It also has large clusters of galaxies, and it has much more active matter than the main Universe, allowing for more extended star formation.
Civilizations
[
]
Alternate Universe A, as stated previously, is very similar to the main Universe. It also has an extended race of Humans, who have become a type 3.6 civilization on the Kardachev Scale, extending outwards into their much larger local group of galaxies. Oddly, no other civilizations have been found, and there are also no signs of any previous civilizations.
