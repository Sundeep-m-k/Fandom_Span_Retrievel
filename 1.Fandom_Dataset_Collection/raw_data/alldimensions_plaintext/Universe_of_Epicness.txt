Structure
[
]
A Universe of Epicness has the structure of a normal universe, with stars, planets, and galaxies. However, all of these structures are composed solely of Protoverses of Epicness.
Stars
[
]
The stars in the Universe of Epicness resemble a typical star in a regular universe, but a lot bigger. These stars somehow do not produce heat/energy from fusion, but instead from fission. Due to how fission is weaker than fusion, this makes the stars generate a lot less heat and energy, making them dimmer.
Planets
[
]
The planets in a Universe of Epicness are relatively small, tightly packed chunks of Protoverses of Epicness. These planets, due to having more mass than a star in a Universe of Epicness, have a much higher gravitational pull than the stars, somehow letting stars rotate around a planet.
Galaxies
[
]
The galaxies in a Universe of Epicness are huge collections of stars and planets all rotating around an object with a sufficient gravitational pull, usually a very dense planet. These galaxies usually form in groups, letting them merge into bigger galaxies. Currently, there are 3 major galaxies, 58 sizable galaxies, 57,974 small galaxies, and countless smaller ones.
