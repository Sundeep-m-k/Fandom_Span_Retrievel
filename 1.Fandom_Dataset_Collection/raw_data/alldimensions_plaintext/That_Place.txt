This is the place. It contains everything. At least until something else takes its place. It's a peaceful place. It's all pitch black.
This is where the R******* God walked a god that came into existence during Bongus' reign, and this is where Bongus sealed him. Mainly because he stole one of his bottles and said he was the creator of everything.
Some say a large tower with a large door moves across The Place. It leads to a random restaurant that serves any kind of food. Other than that, that's really it. It's just a black void where there's a cool restaurant. Eventually, something else will be bigger than That Place, and this will just be a pointless border.
We are not going to do anything like: "Oh, it's bigger than infinity and your mom", because in the end, it's pointless. You won't even bother to read it. The Closest thing we can get is 20 times smaller than the next "Biggest Verse". We also won't throw some bullcrap like: "IT CONTAINS EVERYTHING AND ITSELF AND NOTHING IS BIGGER". Eh.
This has went on for a bit longer than it has to. To sum it up: it's a border. And a pointless obstacle to the true end, which probably does not even exist because of what we create.
