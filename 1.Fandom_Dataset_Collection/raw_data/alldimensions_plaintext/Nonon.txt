Nonon
is an essential
particle
smaller than
Axions
and its subparticles. It is also the largest and most important thing in the Nonon chain. It is supercontained by a
Nothing Axion
, and supercontains
Metiums
.
It is also a "Nonat Particle" kind of which it contains absolutely no traits, excepts for it's abstractly existence. The fact that is "white," of which is technically a "color" according to their rules. However, despite being mostly empty, there is
FAR
more activity in a Nonon than outside, more than you might have thought.

Nullity
[
]
The nullity in this level, is far more than all kinds of
Axions
; in which goes below
null
and
Nothing Axion
. Despite of having a special null property, this level is incomprehensible from axioms and far more than you might expect that "it doesn't occupy a value and a dimension at all." Although, it is made of "null" and "signless" sub-truths which is unprovable in basic type theories; defying basic logic.
This level goes below low-level null hierarchy of Axion's containment definitions and alt-null assumptions; pointing that Nonon's property is undefined in any abstract mathematics. And by undefinedness, any
abstraction of nullity
cancels that out by concentration. Hence, it "holds" an abstract dimension of null-rank and null-existent, being immensely decomposed and isolated from other surreal dimensions extended by
Micro-Axions
.
Nullology mathematics
; being as the hierarchy of nullities, occupy this level. Although, there are more levels besides with it.
Nonium
[
]
Nonium is a element that only exists indirectly inside Nonons. Mostly, it makes up the shell to prevent interactions with null properties. It was formed by instability and immense glitches of Nothing Axion. But for some reason, it does not deform in any way, shape or form. Nonium occurs when Nothing Axion is in it's random element spewing-state.
Nonium has a special property, in which decomposes dimensions assigning into it; and abstraction that defines nullity. Then, it interacts with decomposed dimensions to increase the severity of nullness. It has no shape, but authors depicted it as a 3-oval unity particle.
When a Nonon is formed, it basically teleports into a Nothing Axion because of it's immense glitches. There's a pretty interesting property when it exceeds the glitch stability, the nullity decomposes into higher-level nullities and so Nonium. By then, Nonon swaps with another to prevent but will be "abstractly shrunked" by 1 abstract dimension. The remnants will become unstable Metium due to no interaction of nullity.
Inside the Nonon
[
]
As I said before, the Nonon is far more active than it seems. They are random "Pings" that actually create life than destroy life. The pings are like small yellow explosions that make Nonon entities. Here are some of the Entities below.
Nonoon-A Nonoon is the basic form of life in the Nonon. They make squeaking sounds for no reason and it happens randomly. It looks like a Lightly colored Circle of any light color.
The Oxyhex-The Oxyhex is the most densely populated area in the Entire Nonon. with approimately 100,000,000 Nonoons per Nonkilos (Which is the equivalent of a Kilometer if we were Nonoon-sized.
The Haptegerion-The Haptegerion is an extremely chaotic place where fights are the most frequent. It's density is exaactly 56,723,196 Nonoons per Nonkilos.
The Citites-The Citites are the cities inside the Nonon. Some citites are The Oxyhex, The Haptegerion, The Dormios, The Ujinipsion, The Halaxius, The 1pingos, The Heneperetasapasthegarategosius, and The Kulus-ko-Monos.
*NOTE-These are examples from a
RANDOM
Nonon, because they are simply too many of them.*
