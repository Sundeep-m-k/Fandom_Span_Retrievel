The
Hardcore Mathon
is the 2nd verse in the
hardcoreverses chain
. They are, in many ways, similar to a
Mathon
. However, they do not contain particles related to numbers and concepts, as these have long been surpassed.
The Hardcore Mathons are essentially semitangible superparticles that does not exist nor not exist, nor neither. They've ill defined inner distances, so the
Hardcore Axions
are at every chunk inside at all times, while also existing several times over inside, splitting and reforming over 100 times a
Voidsecond
[

]
, although residents of the Hardcore Axions can not measure this by any means.
The Hardcore Mathons do not have a concept of time or metatime, making it impossible to traverse. The only way that they can even be measured is by forcibly destroying a Hardcore Axion and hoping that the remnants are by chance recombined to another one before they leave their old one. This usually only happens with one or two Axions becoming Axions in new Hardcore Axions, but from this limited data, many properties of the Hardcore Mathons have been found.

Stages
[
]
From avaliable information, a list of stages has been compiled as to what occurs when an object that does not meet the classifcations of a Hardcore Axion is outside of one in a Hardcore Mathon.
Stage 1:
[
]
Particles in the object lose their ability to meaningfully interact with each other and contain unique data. Forces begin to fall apart.
Chaos Fabric
starts to lose configuration
Stage 2:
[
]
Large amounts of energy are used to break powerful bonds.
Chaos Fabric
begins to unwravel into
Primordium Particles
and that Primordium also begins to change into different particles by forced change of the configuration of their
Blueprint Particles
. The Primordium Particles completely become blueprint particles by the end of this stage.
Stage 3:
[
]
All of every blueprint particle's
Existence Rank
is stripped from them, and they become
·
.
Stage 4:
[
]
Through complex means, all of the ·s are converted into mathons representing the same concept as ·, but since it does not convey anything, the mathons convey an empty equation as their mathematical concept.
Stage 4.5:
[
]
The mathons react to applied force greater than the force they represent and dissapear into an imaginary concept that contains nothing, essentially deleting them.
Stage 5:
[
]
The collapsed mathons then are forced outwards by the pull of a reverse singularity, finally making them the Hardcore Mathon.
Why are they called Hardcore Mathons?
[
]
When objects enter them, they deteriorate into collapsed imaginary mathematical concepts. This singular concept is all that makes them up. In essence, the Hardcore Mathons are reverse black holes, with a singularity on the outside, stretching on forever, and its event horizon inside, surrounding the Hardcore Axions. The Hardcore Mathons are named as such because collapsed Mathons are what makes them up.
Why are they represented with a white circle?
[
]
They're represented like that because their real shape is unknown so they're usually represented as circles. Occasionally,
Blueprint Particles
and primordium particles from the deterioration process come back into the Hardcore Axions, creating radiation including light, which is spread out across many wavelengths, so the coloration of the Hardcore Mathon is white.
