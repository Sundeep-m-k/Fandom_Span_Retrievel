Tinyparticles
Up until 'recently', everyone thought that
Blueprint Particles
were the first things possible, as they were the elementary particles. They are so simple that they just make up absolutely everything in
Unireality
. However, those particles could be made by higher realities.
Protoparticles
make up the first possible
Protorealities
, causing it to be at a level that surpasses Blueprint Particles. They are thought to be the Blueprint Particle of things outside of
Alphasms
and
Physical Realms
, as Blueprint Particles can only go so far.

Formation
[
]
Protoparticles are formed when 2
·s
collide each other, each come with paradoxical forces, which swaps the effect of property and blank forces continuously. Without strong blank forces coming from
○s
, this causes a infinite-sized boom of infinite, random
⬤
s. Simultaneously, ○s overwrite the blank forces, and paradoxical forces randomize the property forces. Finally, they will eventually be transformed into random kinds of
Blueprint Particles
.
This also causes the formation of Protorealities inside near ·s.
Properties
[
]
Protoparticles have random properties instead of properties found in our Unireality, and thus, have different kinds of
Blueprint Particles
. Some make dimensionality properties that share with other realities. As you dive deeper through
Archrealities
, properties will be stabilized.
Discovery
[
]
Protoparticles are currently undiscovered yet. From ours, we couldn't visualize everything beyond our
Unireality
. The 2nd Realm creatures found a way to discover Subrealities during a unknown expedition, but they are finding a level below Subrealities yet.
Trivia
[
]
In May 14th, 2021,
Googleaarex
realized existence ranks can be broken down by Existence Blueprint Particles, declaring that Protoparticles are currently the lowest level of objects yet.
4 days later, this has been beaten by the appearance of
Subexistions
.
In 6/24/21, Subexistions have moved into a level between
⬤s
and
Blueprint Particles
, titling the Forcers as "the lowest-level objects yet."
