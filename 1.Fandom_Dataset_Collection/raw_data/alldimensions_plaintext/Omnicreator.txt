History
[
]
The Omnicreator was born in Aspeiros, which is similar to a "Universe" to him. The Omnicreator eventually had an idea: to create a small "verse" for a science project. Doing so would change the entirety of existence and would create something amazing.
Accidental Minden Creation
[
]
When the Omnicreator was tampering with a small "Omnid-glass" ball, he put some "Omni-chemicals" on it and some Ishynae(Large "animal") blood, the ball exploded, causing the Omnicreator to bleed a bit. The blood leaked onto the ball, which had cracked a bit, which caused the blood to leak into it. When the ball reacted with the blood being poured into it, it caused the ball to glow profoundly and cause the ball to become less of a "ball", and more of a verse. After this, the leftover blood caused Mindenspheres to form.
