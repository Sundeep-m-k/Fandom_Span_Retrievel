About
[
]
Primordial Planets
are
planets
(duh) which usually contain one or more
Primordial Continents
(our local one has a single continent), while being contained by
Primordial Galaxies
.
Types
[
]
Similar to the planets of an
Universe
, Primordial Planets can be both rocky and gaseous. Gaseous ones are usually smaller than rocky ones, though.
Structure
[
]
These mostly apply to rocky Primordial Planets.
Primordial Crust
[
]
The crust of the object is made out of Crustium. It supports a Primordial Planet. Without it,
Primordial Nations
and
cities
would not exist and the object would crumble to pieces the size of a Primordial City.
Primordial Stabilizers
[
]
These are structures that surround the core and can keep the planet from destroying. Without it, the Primordial Planet will be more prone to
Primordial Asteroids
and primordial solar flares. The stabilizers act as a magnetic field of the primordial planet.
Primordial Core
[
]
It is an indestructible core made out of Primordicorium, a non newtonian fluid. It is the source of energy of Primordial Cities. Without it, all cities and electronics would not work. The energy is sended to inside the Primordial Stabilizers.
Primordial Protective Layer
[
]
It is an atmosphere that is operated by Primordial Stabilizers. It protects, I guess.
