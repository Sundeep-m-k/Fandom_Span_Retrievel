The Pizza verse is like, a give away verse, except it gives away Pizza. This is where all

About
[
]
This verse gives away millions of types of pizzas, the most popular are, Fire Pizza, Antimatter Pizza, and The Famous, Omnium morborum curationes Pizza. Over a googol amount of pizza are sold each year, and yeah lots of people come here, and eat. You can get ordinary, normal sized pizzas for free, but buying more than 10 pizzas at once cost a 100$ fee, and exclusive pizzas, like the “Anti Matter Pizza” cost over 1,000,000,000$ to prevent people from arbitraging. Every
Gigaverse
has 2 Pizzaverses, the government thought making a Pizzaverse was a great idea to reduce world hunger, or should I say Universal Hunger.
