The
GLITCHverses
(also known as
Glitchverses
) are the smaller
glitchy
verses
in the
ERRORverses Chain
. Although they're extremly glitchy, some unique things can be found here.
They contain an indefinite number of
ERRORverses
and
extreme glitchonicites
. Their effects are enough that the colors of a GLITCHverse breaks down into RBGA colors. Their shape is not so stable either; if touched by another GLITCHverse, then everything in them would implode up to roughly the diameter of a
Aironaverse
. A lot of matter then could get lost and forced to go into other GLITCHverses.
Also, some other foreign matter is present everywhere. These are sometimes so strange that the glitchy properties can't normally happen due to them. All of these observations are what is known about what can these
elements
do to their local GLITCHverses. Not even
cosmic entities
like
2048 Tiles
can easily stabilize them.
Unique features
[
]
This tabber shows several unique things about the GLITCHverses.
Colors
Structure irregularity
Law defying
As previously stated, because of the extremeness of the glitchonicites within them, their caused amount of glitch causes the GLITCHverses to be in different colors. The colors the elements force them to produce break down to RBGA colors. Sometimes different and even unlikely colors can appear. This is always happening and there's no way to stop it, unless you get rid of the GLITCHverses.
Their structure is like broken pieces of matter. Occasionally, colors can break up into original, "new" ones, but only if those colors are a combination of two or more. The coolest thing is that fractals (see the next tabber) can somehow be formed in GLITCHverses, but are in a corrupted form.
Laws are defied so much by the GLITCHverses that they shouldn't even properly exist in them right away, but without them things could go far worse than normal (could end up screwing Fake Pageverses above, for example), so laws are
not
completely defied and this makes things better. Still, glitchonicites are too extreme and hard to maintain for things to fully work.
Also, all laws in GLTICHverses are very different from eachother. In fact, some are so defied that they state contradictory things, leading to paradoxes. Example: some laws could be stating that their GLITCHverse should never be lost, while others make them have a determined lifetime.
Effects to larger verses
[
]
GLITCHverses can suddenly lose a lot of matter due to what has been mentioned before, being able of corrupting their
CORRUPTverses
and sometimes almost totally destroys themselves or even their CORRUPTverse. GLITCHverses are also glitchy enough to cause some trouble on a
Fake Pageverse
scale. Categories may have wrong orders and/or having blank spaces in a letter which a page title starts with. That page is still in the category and it's not deleted (or it is), and sometimes failed to be in that category. Even so, some templates can have errors which are hard to fix, one of a
FANDOM
's errors. These verses (if glitchier) can sometimes even be a virus attacker to
Fake Googleverses
/
Windowsverses
.
How to destroy them
[
]
The way GLITCHverses are destroyed isn't done with ease nor obviousness. The first and "easiest" way is to simply destroy them completely out of existence. This will let their local ERRORverses to conjoin together, so this needs to be done at least 3 times because of that.
