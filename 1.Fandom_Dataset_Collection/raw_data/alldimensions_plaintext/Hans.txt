About
[
]
Hans
(also known as "The C√°ca Man")
is a
cosmic entity
that resides in Der Boxenverse. His main life goal is to open Der Boxen. He has a german accent for some reason even though he was never exposed to Germany. He also is very good at engineering.
Appearance
[
]
Hans looks like pyro from Team Fortress 2.
Der Boxenverse
[
]
Der Boxenverse
is a
verse
only permanently inhabited by Hans that has a diameter of only 10 light-years. It is filled with lots of boxes which are relatively easy to open, although there is a box that is impossible (through tested means) to open which is known as the
Der Boxen
. Der Boxenverse is contained by our
Omniverse
.
Box Contents
[
]
Normal boxes contain random objects inside, such as pencils, books, alien objects, food, pieces of machinery, materials and sometimes some anomalous things. Boxes that are harder to open have more uncommon and valuable objects. It is unknown what Der Boxen contains.
Box Creation
[
]
Der Boxenverse creates boxes from nowhere at random at random places. A box which is as hard to open as Der Boxen has yet to be created yet.
Creation
[
]
Hans was created in 102,511,952
BOYC
, when 129 billion gods discovered Der Boxenverse and wanted to open Der Boxen, so they used all of their power and life force to create Hans and died immediately after due to not having any life force or power anymore.
Here are some notable entities in the group:
Yargheriar - This guy here had significant time manipulation powers. Ruled over 1
Dokaverse
Nothsluin - She had verse creation and manipulation powers. Ruled over 23 Dokaverses
Haslayiid - Was an engineer like Hans, probably contributed to his intelligence
Hans, which was still very young and stupid, wandered the cosmos for 10 OYC until he found a
moon
called
Nirlis
. He fell in there and he got raised there by two eel people for 50,000 OYC.
In 102,463,429 BOYC, Hans figured out his life purposed and went back to Der Boxenverse. He then immediately started trying to open Der Boxen. However, there were a lot of entities that tried to take over Der Boxenverse.

Highest quality picture of Xisma we have
In 93,428,120 BOYC, a cosmic entity called Xisma was looking for verses for her to rule over, and she found Der Boxenverse. She thought that Hans was just a weak humanoid because he was only 2 meters in height (very small for a god) so she tried to kill him, but he was actually more powerful. Xisma tried to remove Hans's power, although he was very epically immune, and they were in a back and forth struggle to kill each other for 6 hours until Hans threw her into his Electric Blast Furnace and Xisma was burned alive. Hans then absorb Xisma's ashes to gain minor omniscience of his surroundings

Picture of Nakeros
In 89,104,953 BOYC, an entity called Nakeros tried to take over Der Boxenverse and make it into their very evil domain, but Hans was already prepared due to his minor omniscience. Nakeros tried to glitch Hans and turn him into a glitched zombie, but since Hans is an experienced engineer he was able to debug himself faster than the glitching was occuring, effectively being immune to Nakeros's power. Hans then decided to use some of the syntax errors still spewing out of him before he debugged them, and modified them with Tungstenglitchonicite so that they were 10,000x stronger. Then he used the modified errors on Nakeros, glitching THEM and killing them. Hans then used his vaccuum freezer to de-glitch Nakeros's dead body and absorbed it so he gained more power.
Attempt #3
[
]
In 87,953,104 BOYC,
Nick
tried to take over Der Boxenverse to add to his totally epic empire, but he actually was not that powerful on an omniversal scale, so Hans was able to defeat him in 30 minutes using his really cool guns. Nick survived the encounter, but some of his power was absorbed by Hans (not all of it).
Attempt #4
[
]
In 84,214,052 BOYC, a cosmic faction called The Fablidis (The Very Powerful in Hameryssian) which ruled over a hendaverse tried to kill Hans for his valuable technology. It is estimated that the Fablidis were composed of 17.4 trillion low-level gods. This invasion resulted in the Fablidian War, lasting for 1 entire OYC
(still less than
Reconquista
jajaja)
, ending in a decisive Hans victory. Hans was left very hurt and bruised and would take 31 OYC to recover, and 99.4% of the Fablidian gods died, with 0.6% fleeing.
Abilities
[
]
Hans is very talented and powerful due to having the power of 129 billion gods. Here is his list of abilities and skills:
Inventing and creating machines and tools
Being, like, really good at engineering
Being very smart (you could say he can..
think outside the box
*INSERT LAUGH TRACK*)
Low-level Reality Bending
Low-level Omniscience
More...
Hostility
[
]
Hans is normally very friendly and will welcome you to Der Boxenverse, however he will annihilate you if you are an evil entity or exclusively use the U.S. Customary System
(also known as the Imperial Systemü§Æ)
.
Hans's Structures
[
]
Since Hans has been in Der Boxenverse for 100,000 OYC, he has built some structures:
Der Lagerraum
Das Laboratory
Die Fabrik
Der Energieproduzent
Der Lagerraum
[
]
Der Lagerraum
(The Storageroom in german)
is a room similar to a shed that only has a 10 meter side length, however it has a pocket dimension that has a continuously increasing size
(19,000,000 km/s
2
)
. The pocket dimension is mostly used to store all of the items that the gods before Hans found inside all of the boxes.
Das Laboratory
[
]
Das Laboratory is an artificial planet the size of Mercury with millions of rooms. In these rooms, lots of AI worker robots are continuously working on new technologies that could open Der Boxen.
Die Fabrik
[
]
Die Fabrik is a giant artificial planet roughly the size of Mars that produces AI worker robots within its shell. A lot of the AI worker robots produced are used to expand the factory planet even more, which makes it expand exponentially.
Der Energieproduzent
[
]
Der Energieproduzent is a dyson sphere that houses a
Class ŒîM Star
. This structure completely encompasses the star, and it has 9 layers that are all made to capture the energy of the star.
