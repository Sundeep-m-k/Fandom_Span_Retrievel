The Yellownoseverse is a lot like the
Bignoseverse
and other noseverses, but it is yellow.
This noseverse is special because it contains a ton of lemons. There is not a spot in this verse where there are not lemons. Even the empty space is made out of air, which are evaporated lemons.
Anyone who tries to enter this verse without physical protection will be turned into a lemon instantly. That is why you need to get a Lemonsasa suit to get through this verse, as that prevents you from becoming a lemon.
If you have one though, you will have an endless supply of lemons here. Also, the crust is stable so the weight of the lemons will not break it.
