The
Mu Megastingers
are
cosmic organisms
that live in roughly 11% of
verses
in our local
Existence
. They should be watched out for, as they're capable of destroying verses with low barrier shield (symbol: bẞ). They can also withstand temperatures of -90,000°C to 17 nonillion°C.

They are technically
gods
, because they create verses from
versal energy
. Their colloquial category is a verse supporter. The
megastingers
are known as stingers if they're inside an universe, though.
They can extract energy from
stars
or
planets
. They reside in cosmic hives, created out of hardened versal energy.
History
[
]
They first appeared 296 trillion
OYC
ago. They started out as crab-sized creatures that attacked
cosmic crabs
. About 34 trillion OYC passed, and their average size was around car-sized, and started stinging their target planet's surface as soon as they found one.
They grew in size, survived in more extreme conditions, and finally concluding to the megastingers. About 1 day ago, the last stinger to break out from its home universe broke out.

The last photo taken of the  Jakaoakina cisnartix, a species that went extinct in 1871 due to excessive hunting. It was known for its ability to solve hard problems. The photo was taken in 1870, by the Aprochians. The photo was taken on a planet with a parent star out of a
universe

Well, a species named Homo Sapiens took over the planet.
HEY, WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO TAKE PICTURES OF ME?!
Aprochians… I have one final message to you.

Hey, is summer starting yet?
Wait a minute, I don't have a summer! We're just like bees in a hive!
The radio waves is how they communicate with each other, proven by Karakas Mesjema, an Aprochian scientist.
