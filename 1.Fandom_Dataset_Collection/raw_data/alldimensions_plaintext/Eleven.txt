Elevens
(
Grob'ba
in
The Pencil Language
or
Hend
in Future English) are weird verses parallel to
Ones
, the first verses of the
One Chain
. Elevens are also the start of a new number chain, the
Eleven Chain
. Eleven is significantly different from its regular counterpart.
Appearance
[
]
Elevens have an extremely weird appearance. This is due to their entrance, which is a physical hole of sorts. This hole make Elevens, when viewed from the outside, seem small, but when viewed from the inside, seem huge.
Structure
[
]
Elevens have a mostly empty interior, with occasional bright lights which can somehow never be reached, as they keep getting further away from you if you try to travel to them. The lights will move straight away from you, proving that the verse is infinite.
Planets
and
stars
have also been found inside Elevens, although they don't seem to have any mass.
