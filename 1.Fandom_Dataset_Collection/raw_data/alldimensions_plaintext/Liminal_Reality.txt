Structure
[
]
The structure of Liminal Reality is an obscured version of
Earth
â€˜s wherein certain locations are arranged in a strange manner. Several buildings are left completely obscure, appearing extremely familiar yet with strange details. Most buildings are left abandoned, but are always being found. The number of strangely familiar places found consecutively have caused insanity to its inhabitants.
