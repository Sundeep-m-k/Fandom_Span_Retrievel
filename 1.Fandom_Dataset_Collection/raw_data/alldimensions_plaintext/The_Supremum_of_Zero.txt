Supremum of zero
The
Supremum of Zero
is the largest and final antipode of the
Grasslands
.
"
On the day of the bright, a normal day, none other from the rest, him, Gaoburn, masterfuly executed his wicked plan upon the Grasslands. A plan crafted ever since his birth, a plan that was brought upon to him, passed down from generations and generations, as he, Gaoburn, was the chosen one, the one, to complete the final task. From the ashes of the dead divine and evil spirits, of plans and technology unconceived to the modern man, kept secret for years numbering uncountable, it was with those deathly things that he summoned the 5 forbidden souls from the
Alebo-Ashewan
. The souls, whom acted devilish to such lengths and heights, as to be damned by the Hchezics and void lords.
...
The fifth and last reincarnate, spared from a suffering greater than that of the dwelling anchorites of the
Apheghaza
, was the Supremum of Zero. The maximum of null, zero and nothingness. This archangel inherited the highest powers, and he found strength in other-Realmly lords, and their teachings were recieved by the Supremum of Zero. And in unison, the Supremum of Order, the Supremum of Chaos, the Supremum of Noise and the Supremum of Zero cried their terrible roars to the world, the universe, everywhere at once and to every being, and with their bringing to life, the plan had officially begun."

The Grassland Codex
"It is, however, a highly esoteric and mythical rendition of the happenings. It is unfortunately the most accurate testimony thought to exist today."
The dimensionality uses the
C
n
{\displaystyle \mathcal{C}_n}
function and the
Y
{\displaystyle \mathfrak{Y}}
constant.
C
n
{\displaystyle \mathcal{C}_n}
is the chaos function, described in the article of the
Supremum of Chaos
, and the
Y
{\displaystyle \mathfrak{Y}}
constant is described on the article for the
Supremum of Limits
.
The
Thubbunurrhypil
in the
Supremum of Zero
are distorted so far, to the point of reaching 0 and infinity simultaneously.
