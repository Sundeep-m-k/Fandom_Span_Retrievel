The Mirron is a extremely small particles, Contained by
Yarrons
. Mirrons are 50,000,000 (50 Million) times smaller than
Yarrons
. Mirrons are incredibly complex particles, That are insanely small, To be honest, This shouldn't be described as "A Thing". This instead should be called: Not even nothing, smaller than nothing, N/A. Mirrons last for 7 - 10 Years. There are also Antimirrons, These are 50x smaller than a normal Mirron, Mirrons spin clockwise, And antimirrons spin counterclockwise. Mirrons dont do anything, They just spin, and die, They don't interact with anything, Not even with itself.
However, Mirrons were much, MUCH BIGGER. 200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Years ago, They were about 500km big, However, that long ago, there were 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of them as now. We have proved that Mirrons and Antimirrons exist, but there could be a Up mirron and Down mirron.
