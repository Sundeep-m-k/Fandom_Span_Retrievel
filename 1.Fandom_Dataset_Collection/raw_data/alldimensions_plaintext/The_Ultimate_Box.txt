Formation of Ultimate Boxes
[
]
Ultimate boxes are mostly made by particles released by
Vs
which after a long time and a bunch of weird properties take the shape of a
Box
. The particles of the Vs then turn purple after this, making them look, well, purple. Dont ask why any of this happens.
Trivia
[
]
This type of Box would suddenly catch on fire and eventually disintegrate if there were no spaces bethween their structure on an atomic level, but the particles made space in them, so they dont collapse. Thus, altering the atomic structure of an Ultimate Box is the easiest way to destroy them.
Besides the verses they contain, Ultimate Boxes are nothing but
Quarks
and
Atoms
. Most Quarks are strange Quarks, but some charm ones exist too.
