A
Nultiverse
[

]
is a weak structure of parallel
Universes
contained entirely within three-dimensional space. It is formed via the random production of infinitesimal particles in an empty infinite space, and their evolution into Universes.
As with other similar clusters, Nultiverses can exist separately to the standard
Archverses
, if the diameter exceeds the available length in a
Multiverse
. Nultiverses are also less difficult to produce artificially within an advanced civilization.
Separation
[
]
The parallel universes within a Nultiverse are separated on all physical levels; a set of perfectly identical Universes would merge via gravitational force.
Examples of dividers:
Distance to counter gravity
Different
Uqraek fiber
to counter subatomic interaction
Temporal distance to counter standard physical interaction
