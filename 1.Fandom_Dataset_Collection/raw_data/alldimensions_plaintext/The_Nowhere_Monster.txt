The Nowhere Monster absorbs abstract concepts that are neither applicable, inapplicable nor beyond both nor their contracdition. Nothing is important or unimportant, because for the Monster they're same. It has no sense but it is not nonsense. Tenses example, past time, future time now, just liberated.
The Nowhere Monster spawns indefinite amounts of new categories of “is/isn’t”, hypostases and differences then annihilates them. The Nowhere Monster is not something can be transcended. The Nowhere Monster doesnt depend or not depend even independence is too depend. It is not describle/indescrible, not meaningful/meaningless, not truth/lie nor transcendent/untranscendent. The Nowhere Monster can use concepts that their potential never became even not imagined but unimagined.
