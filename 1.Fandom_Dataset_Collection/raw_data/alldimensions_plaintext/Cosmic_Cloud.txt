The
Cosmic Cloud
is a
Multiversal
natural object, caused by gases, or
gaslike materials leaking out of
Universes
into their parent Multiverse
. This is in the majority of cases
completely harmless to other universes and they are impervious to the gas, either due to having a strong impenetrable surface, or because the gas isn't compatible with the laws of the other universe.
Cosmic Clouds
don't have one single size, as
Cosmic Clouds
can be anywhere from a single quasi-gas or gas particle that escaped, to filling an
entire Multiverse
. In most cases, the
Cosmic Cloud
is a small chunk of the Multiverse, anywhere from
3% to 8% is the 99% of all cases of this phenomena.
However, most Multiverses simply don't have these
Cosmic Clouds
(like ours).
Simply getting particles themselves to escape a universe would be considered a miracle for the majority of Universes.
