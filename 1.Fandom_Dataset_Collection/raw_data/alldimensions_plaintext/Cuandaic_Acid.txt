O
{\displaystyle {\ce {Cn3S8N^{hE}6H2O}}}
, being composed of
cuanday
, sulphur,
hyperenergised
nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen. It is extremely potent, being able to dissolve diamond,
unobtanium
and even
toxicium
in its lower state.
Creation
[
]
Cuandaic acid has a very complicated creation process. First, ammonia (
NH
3
{\displaystyle \ce{NH3}}
) is hyperenergised in a T-Y7J hyperenergiser to create N-hyperenergised ammonia (

hE
H

{\displaystyle {\ce {N^{hE}H4}}}
). Then, it is reacted with water to form hE-nitroxyhydride (

O
{\displaystyle {\ce {N^{hE}6H2O}}}
) and nitrogen. Then, it is reacted with cuanday dust and sulphur to create Cuandaic Acid.
