Apples
[
]
Apples are froot dropped from the tree that are highly radioactive and explosive. If they drop from a height higher than 65% of the tree they can explode, destroying many verses.
Oranges
[
]
Oranges are the opposite of apples, they aren't radioactive or explosive.
Lemons
[
]
If lemons are in contact with dirt they can burst, covering many verses in lemon juice that can destroy stuff in them.
Pears
[
]
They are liquefied on contact with air so they are inside the froot tree.

They kill all living beings they touch.
