Ultrium, also known as the True Allsphere or the Ultimate Allsphere, refers to the main collection of realms, such as
Nihilum
,
Aperiofinity
And
The Allsphere
, and
The Allcubes
,
Irrepressiblecosm
, The
Eternalworld
and
The Unlimited Prism
, and an infinite amount of others that arenâ€™t worth mentioning. This is also the second-to-last verse.
Many theories exist in regards to Ultrium and what it is, but one of the most accurate is that Ultrium is not a place, but a realm itself. Ultrium is a realm outside reality entirely.
If we would to apply human understanding to it, it would be akin to a black fog that has the ability to stretch and contract depending on the actions of the beings that inhabit it. Ultrium is almost like a higher dimension as it sits above the main dimensions, but it could also be considered a dimension beyond that of the main realms, thus making it a dimension outside the main dimensions.  Time and space are meaningless, and the laws of reality do not apply within Ultrium. This is also where the
In-Betweener
resides.
