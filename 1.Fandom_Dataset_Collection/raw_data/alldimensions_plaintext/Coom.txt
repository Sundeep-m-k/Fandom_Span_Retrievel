A picture of Coom.
Coom
(derived from
Akalorian
cuoḿ
)
is a highly dangerous and infectious liquid that converts all matter near it into itself. It does this by spontaneously fusing or dividing
atoms
and
molecules
to create the molecular structure of Coom, which is kept confidential by the
LUA
. Interplanetary
voids
are dense enough for it to propagate, but interstellar voids are too sparse, which means that a single molecule of Coom made will convert an entire
star system
but usually not a
galaxy
.
If Coom is released in a verse denser than interstellar voids, then it will convert the entire thing.

Rates of Transmission
[
]
Probable structure of a Coom molecule
Coom converts materials at a rate of ~0.94 kg/s
(at a temperature of exactly 20ºC and a pressure of 1 atm)
, meaning that denser materials make it convert slower. Below is a chart of the volume rates of transmission of various substrates.
To calculate the rate for any material divide 0.94 by its density in kg/m

History

How Coom and other stuff is made
Coom was first discovered in the year 2263 by the Zyx

chemist Zxyzyx Xzyzx

. It rapidly overrun their star system and led them to extinction in just a few days.
Zyx Logs [TRANSLATED]

The Zyx language Xzyzx speaked isn't entirely known as it is now extinct. Sections marked with (?) are uncertain.
Day 1
I have synthesized a new material in my search for an organic superconductor (?), called Zxyxzyz, made with [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. However, it is not normal (?). A sample of merely 12 Xyzxz
[

]
rapidly turned into 15, then 20. It started converting the air, causing to drip to the my desk. (?) I quickly evacuated the lab to see it turn to liquid.
How to Destroy
[
]
There aren't a lot of ways to destroy Coom, but here are some
(Free to add more)
.
Heat it up to ~2,100 ºC, where it will separate into [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]
Insert it into a black hole
React it with
Glitchonicite
to create Coomathol, a gas that does not have Coom's infectious properties and can be used as a 99.9999999999% effecient fuel

A minor civilisation
(Type 2.6)
in
UNI-205
that went extinct due to this incident.

Holy shit look at this name. With names like that, maybe they deserved to go out.

A Zyx unit of measurement in this case equivalent to 104 grams.
