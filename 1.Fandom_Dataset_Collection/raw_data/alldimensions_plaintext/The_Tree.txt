Perhaps one of the most important reality stabilizers in all of the
First Realms
, the
Trees
not only have an existence-smoothing effect inside their many branches, but outside of them as well, with the chain of containment letting the Trees' energy permeate throughout their local First Realm.
The stabilization of physics, math, and other extremely fundamental forces or objects such as
Primordium Particles
stem from the roots of the Trees and go up the trunk into their branches, hence why lower ones are far more stable.
Speaking of stability, despite the Trees' effects on everything, the fact they at this point are the containees greatly weaken their power across the First realms, although still noticable compared to the frighteningly odd
Second Realms
. Of course, all beyond those are much more unstable and bizarre, but not as much as they could be.
Due to their importance, the Trees have gained nicknames such as "The Plants of our Ways," "The 0.5th
Everything Layers
", and other very positive titles.
The Trees have
verses
within them that are the same as those of the Branches, in greater quantity of course, and other Trees around them are all connected by roots, however the links are very thin and Trees are separated based on the thinnest part of their roots. No extremely sized
organisms
lay here, as the Trees don't bear
fruits
or has any nutritional value, as their insides fully consist of inedible
sap
