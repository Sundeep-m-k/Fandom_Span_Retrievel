The
Relative Spaces
are the areas where our
Extreme Wall
,
Megaloverse
and many others reside. The amount of different shapes is believed to cause the different Megaloverses in these spaces to become spheres.
Despite being far larger than the Extreme Walls, our Relative Space barely contains a few tens of Megaloverses outside of them.
Not much else is known about this type of space, as it and many other higher up spaces have only recently been discovered.
