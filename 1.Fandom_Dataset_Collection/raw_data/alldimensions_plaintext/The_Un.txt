The Un
is a type of verse which contains
Megaverses
and
Yottaverses
. Every time a
Teraverse
comes in contact with the Un, the
Teraverse
and the Un will both explode in an
Ultranova
, a very large supernova. This Ultranova releases approximately 10
122
joules of energy on average, and it obliterates everything in a approx. 9.6 x 10

light year radius. There are about 10
