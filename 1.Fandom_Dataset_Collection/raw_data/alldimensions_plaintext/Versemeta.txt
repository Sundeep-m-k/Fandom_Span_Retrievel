Versemetas
are a type of simulated "verses" found in some inhabited
Versemegas
, thus it can be thought of as the negative counterparts of a
Metaverse
. It was constructed by the colleagues of
Scalene
to test the new
Oakverse
transistors in the negative enviroment. They are populated with structures called
Versehypers
and
Versexenos
, so the other simulation verses are not related to
Archverses
, but eventually reconnect with them at the
Versegigas
which are half-simulated. When data gets lost from the
Xenoverses
, it ends up in
MOREs
followed by
Verseunis
followed by Versemetas.
Entrance
[
]
You can enter a Versemeta if you have the authorization by two Oakverses staffs, and one
weak entity
. They will give you the password which VR you to the start screen, which is basically a huge negative-sized valley full of
Glitchonicite
. So, good luck surviving that if you're a positive entity. You can also explore the procedural objects. To exit, you must go to the Exit Bar.
