A "
star
"
is large celestial body that is
spherical
(except in
universes
with different laws of physics and/or higher dimensions) under its own
gravity
(i.e., in hydrostatic equilibrium) and releases large amounts of heat and light energy through nuclear fusion. They are composed mainly of
hydrogen and helium
. They are usually found in the centres of
solar systems
, and can be orbited by several
planets
and occasionally smaller stars.

Classes
[
]
There are a variety of different stellar classes, each of which with their own unique properties. There are a lot of
star classes
that exist in
our universe
; here is a list:
Class O stars
[
]
A
Class O star
is the brightest and hottest type of star inside an universe, sitting on the line between main sequence and giant. Traditionally, they are coloured blue. They are also the rarest type of main-sequence star, making up only 0.00001% of luminous stars. A typical class O star has a mass of 50 solar masses, a radius of 10 solar radii, a luminosity of 100,000 solar luminosities, a surface temperature of 40000 K and a lifespan of 10 million years.
The habitable zone of a typical O-Class star is on the order of 500 AU. This, coupled with their short lifespans, makes them poor candidates for having solar systems, especially those that support life.
Class B stars
[
]
A "Class B star" is the second-brightest type of main sequence star. They are typically colored blue-white, slightly less blue than O-type stars. They are fairly rare, making up only 0.13% of main-sequence stars. A typical Class B star has a mass of 9 (2 to 16) solar masses, a radius of 4 (2 to 7) solar radii, a luminosity of 1,000 (25 to 30,000) solar luminosities, a surface
temperature
of 20,000 K (10,000 K to 30,000
K
), and a lifespan of 40 million years.
The habitable zone of a typical Class B star is on the order of 50
AU
. While they also possess short lifespans, making planets and life rare, there are a few examples of B-type star systems, including HIP 78530.
Class A stars
[
]
"Class A stars" are bright White-Blue main sequence stars that tend to have a short lifespan, and are the third warmest type of star. they have extremely high temperatures far greater than out sun, the reason for this is because of its massive hydrogen consumption. These stars usually have twice the mass and size of our sun examples are Sirius, Vega, Altair. It is rare for this stars to have rocky planets since these stars are really hot and rocky planets might be instantly molten or turned into gas or plasma.
Class F stars
[
]
A "Class F star" is the fourth-hottest type of main sequence star. They are typically colored white or yellow-white. They make up roughly 3% of main-sequence stars. A typical Class F star has a mass of 1.2 (1.04 to 1.4) solar masses, a radius of 1.3 (1.15 to 1.4) solar radii, a luminosity of 3 (1.5 to 5) solar luminosities, a surface temperature of 6,750 K (6,000 K to 7,500 K), and a lifespan of 5 billion years.
While these stars have lifespans a bit shorter than the Sun, they are likely candidates for planets and life with habitable zones around 1.5 AU away, though perhaps they might become too bright and hot later in their lives for intelligent life to develop.
Class G stars
[
]
A Class G star is the third-dimmest type of main sequence star besides brown dwarfs. They are typically colored yellow or yellow-white. They made up roughly 8% of all main-sequence stars. A typical Class G star has a mass of 0.9 (0.8 to 1.04) solar masses, a radius of 1.05 (0.96 to 1.15) solar radii, a luminosity of 1 (0.6 to 1.5) solar luminosity, a surface temperature of 5,600 K (5,200 K to 6,000 K), and a lifespan of 10 to 15 billion years.
Their habitable zones range from ~0.6 to 1 AU, and their long lifespans and relatively high brightness means they are very good candidates for life-bearing planets. Earth's sun is a class G star, actually, as are many stars with known extrasolar planets.
Class K stars
[
]
A Class K star is the second-dimmest type of main sequence star besides brown dwarfs. They are typically colored yellow-orange or orange. They make up roughly 12% of all main-sequence stars. A typical Class K star has a mass of 0.6 (0.45 to 0.8) solar masses, a radius of 0.8 (0.7 to 0.96) solar radii, a luminosity of 0.3 (0.08 to 0.6) solar luminosities, a surface temperature of 4,450 K (3,700 K to 5,200 K), and a lifespan of 50 to 100 billion years.
With their extremely long lifespans and acceptable brightness, it is very likely that many Class K stars have life-bearing planets, and many exoplanets have been discovered around stars of this class.
Class M stars
[
]
A Class M star is the dimmest type of main sequence star besides brown dwarfs. They are typically colored red or red-orange. They are by far the most common type of luminous star, making up roughly 76% of all main sequence stars. A typical Class M star has a mass of 0.20 (0.08 to 0.45) solar masses, a radius of 0.3 (≤0.7) solar radii, a luminosity of 0.01 (≤0.08) solar luminosities, a surface temperature of 3,000 K (2,400 K to 3,700 K), and a lifespan of 1 to 10 trillion years.
Although they have very long lifespans, red dwarfs' low mass and luminosity (and their habitable zones of about 0.1 AU) means that many planets will end up frozen or tidally locked to their parent star; these are generally not good conditions for intelligent life. It may be possible or even common for simple life to develop on these planets, however.
Classes for star-like objects
[
]
Class names for objects that are star-like, but not technically stars do exist, such as Class T and Class L for types of brown dwarfs, the class Y for sub-brown dwarfs, and class D for white dwarfs.
Other Classes
[
]
There are many other star classes not found in our universe, so these are listed in the table below.

Y (Not on

, not the same)
Class Y stars are brown and aren't really stars, they are cold stars, like
Jupiter
, but bigger.
Class Y Stars can exist in the
Mathverse
too. They are green stars, containing a lot of uranium, which means it's radioactive and any passing human will have cancer.
H
An H-Star is a star composed primarily out of an extremely hot glowing mercury-like substance.
H-Stars are very rare, verses which allow only mercury to be formed, can create these, and even then, there's a 1 in 18,000,000 chance of there being one.
So far, only 151,812 H-Stars exist in our
omniverse
Ș
A class-Ș star only exists in the
Lambdaverse
.
&
These stars are orbited by Rainbow Planets and have a huge goldilocks zone of 1 ly thanks to their unique rainbow light, which can warm a planet within a lightyear of its radius.

Gammaverse
.
Ã

.
Ö
The Ö-class stars are rich in Thetanium, the opposite of Titanium. Also, they only exist in
Thetaverse
.

Š-class stars are the result of the collision of a carbon star and an H-class star. There are an estimated 208 of those stars.
Ś
Ś-class stars are cylinder shaped, and have only been found outside our
Multiverse
.
Ṣ
Ṣ-class stars are the result of the collision of a carbon star and a Wolf-Rayet star.

Scale

Diameter
It varies, but most of the time largee than most
Universes
These kinds of "stars" are different than the conventional ones, since these are
kinda
bigger than universes (hence their name), while also having much higher temperatures (the average being over 10
100
°C, or a googol degrees celsius). They can also be classified as
variants of universes
due to how they're formed.
Even the origin of these celestial objects are not like your typical stars, because instead of forming from clusters of helium and hydrogen, they form from "Big-Bangs" that are either way hotter than the ones able to make an universe, the ones that go wrong by some unexpected event, or rarely extremly warm universes that collided into each other (which has a rough average chance of
0.0000000000000000008000000000000000069.009%
in a standard multiverse).
Instead of planets, Universe-sized Stars usually have other universes as the equivalent of those.
Classes
[

Just like ordinary stars, Universe-sized Stars also have lots of special classes too.

-sized Stars
[
]
These Stars are so large they're capable of dominating
Omniverses
,
Boxes
and even beyond that...
It's extremely rare to find even a single one, just like
multiversal
planets.
These have their own class system too, which is pretty much the same as the one the "normal" starys have, with the only real difference being their scale, and the fact the larger and hotter they are, the darker they are too.
