Introduction
[
]
The
Cities of eternal
is an place where the
C O E companies
exist. Also, there are a lot of "Eternal homes" (Read some paragraphs below for more info) on them. The amount of tecnology in these places is huge. Its confirmed that the creator(s) of the city was/were the same ones that founded the companies. In terms of temperature, this place, like the
computers of eternity
, have appropiate temperatures to contain life.
Wars
[
]
Some say that our local city went in war with another one, the proof being that in some of the images the houses look destroyed, and also the ground itself looks withered. The bad quality of the photos makes this hyphotesis unable to be properly confirmed yet, though. If in this place there WAS a war tho it looks like the winners where the ones of our local city since otherwise we wouldnt exist.

The
eternal homes
are the places were local entities of the city of eternal live. We dont have any clue to know how they look, act, socialize, etc. yet again because of the terrible quality of the pictures taken.
We can only know their name, because the cameraman told us that information.
