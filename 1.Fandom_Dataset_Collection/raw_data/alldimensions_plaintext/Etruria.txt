Etruria is a dead country that was conquered by
Terabithia
after the
Terabithian-Etrurian War
. The country used to be a big and diverse first world country, but the government experienced a major corruption event and invaded Terabithia in The
Etrurian war
, with the help of the
Micin
, who eventually turned on them when they realized the war wasn't going their way. Then the
Terabithians
invaded and destroyed the country because of the indecisiveness of
Darok II
. The country was then incorporated into the nation and it was rebuilt. Etruria is now a thriving metropolitan area thanks to
Terabithia
.
