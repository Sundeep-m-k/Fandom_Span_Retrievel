The True Omniverse is the Metaversal equivalent to the
Omniverse.
It contains every finite metanumber scale or smaller thing, and is also incredibly luminous. There is not much to say about True Omniverses, because they are basically just
Metaboxes,
or Omniverses (obviously) but way bigger. However, due to their extreme density and the amount of light the universes inside emanate, this verse is bright enough to blind everything that doesn't have specially made goggles on or the immunity to blindness in some other way. Basically, anything that can be blinded will
