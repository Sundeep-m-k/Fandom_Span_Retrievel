A
Building
is a big complex of
Rooms
stacked together, with hallways connecting them.
The hallways have a gallery of
bongus
at the end of them and if you travel through the gallery hall, you will get to a lift that will get you to the different floors by pressing a button.
Each Room contained within a Building is slightly different from the other ones. Some have different dimensions, others have different
creatures
and realities.
Only beings such as the
Primordial
,
THE CREATOR
and above have went into other Rooms or even outside their local Building. Also, no creatures survive on the outside of a Building since if you get outside them, you will get into the
Never
. A white tiny dot is the only way out of their local
Never
. The outside of our Building isn't that widely known, but the Primordial said that the color of it was white, and that the material was some
