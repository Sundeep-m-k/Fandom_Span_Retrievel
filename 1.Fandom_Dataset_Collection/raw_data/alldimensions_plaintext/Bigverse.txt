A
Bigverse
, as their name may imply, are very large and not to be underestimated. Bigverses tend to be very similar in physics and such to each-other, with a high resistance to corruption or glitching. A Bigverse's most attracting feature is its diversity of
planets
, as warm rocky spheres float around consistently, and these void planets, while lacking air, are still hubs for life. This airless life also tend to be very unique, not having eyes due to the darkness but having very sensitive whiskers most of the time.
Another, less defining trait would be its density. Where there aren't void planets, there are
Clusterverses
, and a Bigverse is usually almost entirely like so, although there is a small bit of void.
Finally, the ruling entity of our Bigverse is known as Unquak. He is an omnipotent entity, being a simple void worm with the aforementioned whiskers attached, and he's rather unsuspecting. But, as the image below shows, he can bend in marvelous ways and is more than just a normaal worm, as well as the rightful owner of our Bigverse.
Unquak being a showoff.
