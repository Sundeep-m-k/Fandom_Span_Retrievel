The Enormous
is very similar to
The Big
and
The Bigger
, except The Enormous is A LOT bigger. Also, there are very few creatures in The Enormous. Most of these creatures are either negative-sized or basic. Only 0.0(34)1 percent of these creatures have advanced technology capable of traveling across multiple
Nots
. These creatures are known as
The Explorers
.
Interesting Phenomenon
[
]
The dimensionality changes randomly. That has caused The Enormous to be a hard place to live. The reason for this is unknown.
Chunks of space rock have randomly appeared inside of The Enormous. When they disappear, they spawn in a powerful entity. The entity will stay forever, and the only way to destroy them is by another one of these entities. Most of these entities are nice, and they will help creatures that happen to be lost. Some of these entities, however, like to eat unsuspecting travelers. These entities call themselves 54 68 65 20 43 6f 6e 74 72 6f 6c 6c 65 72 73. It is also unknown why they refer to themselves using hexadecimal.
Portals like to show up near a few
Nots
. A few copies of
Never
have occasionally appeared through these portals.
