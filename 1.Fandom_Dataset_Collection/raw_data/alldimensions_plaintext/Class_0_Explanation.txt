This is a short summary/explanation of the objects currently in
Class 0
, as their properties (or lack thereof) can be hard to understand at first glance.
Diagram of Class 0 to show the relationships between objects.

Universe Sections
[
]
Universe Sections
are large regions found in 0.2% of Universe's portion within the section the laws of the Universe have a very slight and sudden change.
Atoms
[
]
Atoms
are the biggest kind of matter, which are decomposed into protons, neutrons, and electrons. There are currently 118 elements assigned to themselves, each giving a unique structure.
Quarks
[
]
There are 3 generations of quarks, with a total of 6 flavors. Also, quarks are always bind with a gluon by a strong force, and come with 3 colors.
String
[
]
String
is currently the smallest hypothetical object yet, in which they vibrate for most laws in physics dependent on frequency and altitude. Strings can be folded up into branes. There are also conjoined strings.
Substring
[
]
Uqraek Fiber
[
]
Uqraek Fiber
is a substring object, which consists of the mixture of Protospatial Particles,
Primordium Particles
, and
Blueprint Particles
to build up matter.
Protospatial Particles
[
]
While
Protospatial Particles
occupy spacetime with absolutely zero-sized, they also assign a portion with a specific
Existence Rank
. One example is infamous
Protoverse
, which is existence-1.
Negative-Sized
[
]
Negative-sized objects have negative sizes, and are physically impossible. They are only accessed by a positive / negative
omnipocket
.
