The
Box Of Everything
is a regular, omega-sized box that contains transfinite material
and has space for a bit more.
Its interior is illuminated by a yellow glow, its exterior is purely white.
The
Box Of Everything
opens once every 0.812
OYC
(4,092
OD
), even then, it opens very slowly and starts to close the second the arms reach a 135 degree angle.
Every single
Box Of Everything
opens at the same time.
When this happens, trilliions upon trillions of unsuspecting, and willing, verses escape this box. Often, willing verses travel across from one to another.
On rare occasions
, verses get stuck between the closing doors. Unless the verse in question is exceedingly large,
it will get completely decimated and all inferior verses will scatter around.
