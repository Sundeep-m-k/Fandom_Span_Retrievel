The
cosmicialverse
is the headquarters of the Cosmicians Army, where they are generated and the home of the all-powerful
cosmicialverse
gods (
Kyle Rosse
,
Aria Flower
and
Melinda Ice
). They are also the home of The
Arcanum
Tribe. They often move from place to place, and in such a way that's unpredictable (though in a way that it cannot bump towards verses.)
Not to be confused with the cosmoverse,  the name of the cosmos of the Ultimas Cosmology Wiki.

Description

Structure
[
]
Despite being called a verse, the
cosmicialverse
is more of a sphere building that's absurdly massive. It is made out of walls that are made out of extremely unbreakable walls that can only be broken by
Melinda Ice
(and more powerful gods, though this will never, ever happen). The more powerful the
Melinda Ice
is, the more unbreakable the wall becomes. There are some windows that are just as unbreakable as the main material. The outside is also made out of outside walls (made with the same material as the normal walls) that only has a few openings, automated by a top-of-the-line electricity system that gets much better every planck time.
The
cosmicialverse
consists of mostly long and huge hallways, but also consists of many main parts of the building, all of which are extremely easy for the
cosmicialverse
gods, the cosmicians army and the
arcanums
to navigate to, but extremely difficult for most of the other cosmic entities to navigate to.
The Cosmicialverse Gods' Rooms
The Arcanums' Room
The Lava Pit Room
The Ritual Room
The Prison
Cosmicians Room
Kitchen of Death Valley
The Primordium Delta Zero Room
Simulated Reality Room
Each individual
cosmicialverse
god has a room that allows them to do not only their job, but also the things they want to do and even the things that they do not want to do in case the
cosmicialverse
god has changed their mind.
This room is where the
arcanums
live. While not having as much free will as the
cosmicialverse
gods, they are able to invent literally all kinds of things, which is then reviewed by two or three of the
cosmicialverse
gods. If useful, this will be used for the
cosmicialverse
itself.
There are also a huge generator that manually generates any of the currently supported The
Arcanum
Tribe products and a museum of The
Arcanum
Tribe products that are no longer supported.
This is a room that's empty save for a huge circle that is called the lava pit. The lava pit here isn't a lava pit. It's more torturous than even the verses and cosmic entities that claimed to be the most torturous. This is basically the most brutal way for the three gods or the cosmicians to destroy dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities, and other dangerous, purely bad cosmic things.
How it destroys them is very similar to how fake
cosmicialverses
destroy them, except it's made to be a lot more torturous and destructive, and is made to extract power from the cosmic entity that was destroyed by the lava pit.
The Ritual Room is where
Kyle Rosse
,
Aria Flower
and
Melinda Ice
(and previously
Jerry Lassa
) do the ritual. It is the only room not to contain any lighting. It contains some decorations to make it look more like a typical ritual, and the metal pod with a glowing green wide cylinder in it, which is where
Kyle Rosse
,
Aria Flower
and
Melinda Ice
are supposed to do the ritual.
How it works
[
]
Now
Post-Prologue to Chapter 2
Prologue
In the ritual room,
Kyle Rosse
,
Aria Flower
and
Melinda Ice
may do a ritual. How they did it is unknown. When this happens,
Kyle Rosse
and
Aria Flower
combine into a huge entity that is ridiculously powerful. The creature is called KRAFMI-3. The combination lasts for 3650 human seconds - afterwards they have to wait for 365 human days in order to reactivate it for another 3650 human seconds.
(The overall power (save for intelligence) is visualized by ({(
Kyle Rosse
's overall power), (
Aria Flower
's overall power), (
Melinda Ice
's overall power), ‚àû, ‚àû} and the intelligence is visualized by ({(
Aria Flower
's intelligence), (
Kyle Rosse
's intelligence), (
Melinda Ice
's intelligence), ‚àû, ‚àû}.)
Before
Melinda Ice
joined, the ritual room only required
Kyle Rosse
and
Aria Flower
to do a ritual, which then causes the two gods to combine into a huge entity that has the overall power of
Kyle Rosse
circulated-circulatonated by the overall power of
Aria Flower
(with the exception of intelligence, which has the intelligence of
Aria Flower
circulated-circulatonated by the intelligence of
Kyle Rosse
). The creature was also previously called KRAF-2. The combination lasted for 300 human seconds - afterwards they had to wait for 30 human days before they could reactivate it for another 300 human seconds.
(If you didn't get the idea, the overall power (save for intelligence) is actually visualized by ({(
Kyle Rosse
's overall power), (
Aria Flower
's overall power), ‚àû, ‚àû} and the intelligence is visualized by ({(
Aria Flower
's intelligence), (
Kyle Rosse
's intelligence), ‚àû, ‚àû}.)
Before
Jerry Lassa
was demoted, the ritual room required
Kyle Rosse
,
Jerry Lassa
and
Aria Flower
to do a ritual, which then causes all of those gods to combine into a huge entity that has the overall power of
Kyle Rosse
myriatritated by the overall power of
Jerry Lassa
myriatritated by the overall power of
Aria Flower
(with the exception of intelligence, which has the intelligence of
Aria Flower
myriatritated by the intelligence of
Jerry Lassa
myriatritated by the intelligence of
Kyle Rosse
). The creature was also previously called KRJLAF-3. The combination lasted for 180 human seconds - afterwards they had to wait for 18 human days before they could reactivate it for another 180 human seconds.
(Again, the overall power (save for intelligence) is visualized by (
Kyle Rosse
's overall power)‚Üë

(
Kyle Rosse
's intelligence).
The prison is a place where cosmic entities who are too dangerous to be destroyed or cosmic entities whom the three gods are not ready to destroy. It has a special feature: It not only imprisons other cosmic entities and prevents them from getting out of the prison, but also has the ability to quickly extract power from the imprisoned cosmic entities, decomposing them of all power. Unfortunately, some cosmic entities are both too dangerous to be destroyed and have their power unable to be extracted, so they have to stay there for all eternity.
The prison has an unlimited number of cells. Each cell has a computer that allows the prisoner to wander around all the dimensions and play games (most of which created by
Jerry Lassa
which makes him not completely useless, but some of which created by
Aria Flower
) and only enough resources to keep the prisoner alive.
List of games prisoners can play
[
]
Jerry Lassa Simulator
(10,001 OYC): The first game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the first game overall, the intro consists of him pretending as if the best man in the cosmos was him. The rest of the game consists of stupid randomness combined with game-breaking and outright ugly glitches and some annoying game elements that will make the game harder and more boring.
Super Cheese Grater
(10,001 OYC): The second game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the second game overall, this game is divided into two versions:
Old Version: The story is that the queen is kidnapped by an evil man, and now the cheese grater has to save the queen. This game is notorious for using unfitting music and sound, intentionally horrible spelling and grammar and even confusing, glitchy and horrible game mechanics.
New Version: The story is that the evil force is planning to terrorize the whole world. The cheese grater must save the world by defeating the evil force. The grammar, music and sound is significantly better, but the game mechanics are even worse.
Both versions stop at level 3. In the old version, the third level's boss, the only boss in the game, is impossible, while in the new version, the story has a proper ending saying that the evil force is defeated and the cheese grater saved the world with no casualties.
One Night at Aria Flower's
(10,001 OYC): The third game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the third game overall, this game simply "jumpscares" the player using
Aria Flower
, no matter what the player does.
The Ideal Cases
(10,001 OYC): The first game made by
Aria Flower
and the fourth game overall, this features Johnny Case investigating numerous cases of all the cosmos. Johnny Case must use his trustworthy tablet in order to solve the case and save the world. This game at first has ten cases, all involving murders, but was updated to include a million cases and to include all kinds of crimes. It was constantly updated to have a storyline that seems to never end, until 10,027 OYC, when it finally has an ending.
Bob Simulator
(10,001 OYC): The fourth game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the fifth game overall, this game is outright glitchy and not functional like the previous
Jerry Lassa
game, and is much worse. The gameplay is supposed to be a simulation where as
Bob
, you have to create your own verse and control it. However, due to extreme glitches, this game made the operating system crash the second you create the verse.
Jerry Lassa Simulator 2
(10,001 OYC): The fifth game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the sixth game overall, this game is panned by many prisoners due to being extremely random, extremely glitchy and extremely horrible. It also sports obvious grammar and spelling mistakes.
Enter The Password!
(10,001 OYC): The sixth game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the seventh game overall, this game is supposedly about entering the password. However, typing anything will not work, as the game has no correct passwords. The game will tell you to right-click to auto-solve. When the player right-clicks, the password bar will glitch out and type random characters, leading to a game over.
Hatred and Horror
(10,001 OYC): The second game made by
Aria Flower
and the eighth game overall, this short game is about a serial killer killing the eight characters. The first seven characters have to die as intended, because they will inevitably die. The eighth and last character could either kill or be killed by the serial killer. If the eighth character was killed, the bad ending would happen. If the eighth character kills the serial killer, the good ending will happen.
Find The Criminal
(10,001 OYC): The seventh game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the ninth game overall, this game is supposedly about finding the criminal out of the two people. However, you get no clues, so luck is an important factor to finding the criminal. This is an impossible game - If you choose the innocent first, the criminal will escape the second you choose it. If you choose the criminal first, the criminal will die. Both of these will result in a game over.
Five Nights at Jerry Lassa's
(10,001 OYC): The eighth game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the tenth game overall, this game is a ripoff of
Five Nights at Freddy's
. There are three mechanically unique animatronics trying to jumpscare you, and all you need to do to prevent that is to close the doors the moment an animatronic is about to enter the office.
Unlike
Five Nights at Freddy's
, there are only
four
nights and
three
animatronics (
Jerry Lassa
,
Bob
and
Kyle Rosse
).
God Simulator
(10,001 OYC): The ninth game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the eleventh game overall, this game is notorious for being the a ridiculously horrible game. It had horrible grammar and writing, poor design choice, broken mechanics, unfair level design and poorly made music. Only one god (
Aria Flower
) works -
Kyle Rosse
will experience a blackout, a screen blank and then an error screen.
Jerry Lassa
only shows a seemingly random cutscene.
Sleeping Simulator
(10,001 OYC): The third game made by
Aria Flower
and the twelfth game overall, this game has the premise of you constantly pressing the correct keys to keep sleeping. The farther you get in the game, the more buttons you have to press. If you don't press the correct buttons or fail to press them, the player character will suddenly wake up and jumpscare the player, then causing a game over.
Jerry Lassa Simulator 3: A Job at the Primordialverse
(10,001 OYC): The tenth game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the thirteenth game overall, this game consists of an intro, a 15-second black screen, a job to "clean" the car (or more accurately, soil it),
Jerry Lassa
and the player taking a ride with
Jerry Lassa
annoying the player and finally a glitchy outro.
Jerry Lassa's Restaurant Tycoon
(10,001 OYC): The eleventh game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the fourteenth game overall, this game is impossible - after the introduction, you buy the building, which costs all the money you have. You try to borrow money from the bank, only to be met with a message saying you can't borrow money. You then try to switch the camera, only to be met with Aria Flower jumpscaring you, causing a game over. The game then crashes.
One Night at Jerry Lassa's
(10,001 OYC): The twelfth game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the fifteenth game overall, this game is another impossible game - the one night begins with a call from
Jerry Lassa
, which is not connected to the game at all. The game won't proceed until you open the camera, which causes a glitch that leads to
Jerry Lassa
angrily telling the player that they just crashed the game and that he is very disappointed of them. The game then crashes.
Rhythmic Cosmicians
(10,001 OYC): The fourth game made by
Aria Flower
and the sixteenth game overall, this game is a game where as a
cosmician
, you fight against hundreds of enemy cosmic entities, which are all defeated by pressing the right keys at the right time. The better the player's timings and skills are, the higher score they get. If the player presses a lot of wrong keys at the wrong time, the player will get a low score and fail. If the opposite happens, however, the player will get a very high score and succeed.
Speceship Star
(10,001 OYC): The thirteenth game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the seventeenth game overall, this game starts in a room in the spaceship with lots of rooms, becomes idle for 5 seconds, puts one random character in one seat per second, and the game ends in a game over.
Car Simulator
(10,001 OYC): The fourteenth game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the eighteenth game overall, this game starts in a grassfield. After the player presses enter, the player has to hold W to move forward. The car is so slow, and early on in the second screen, the car becomes haywire and crashes into the moon, leading to a game over with the crashed car.
Jerry Lassa Simulator: At the Office
: The game actually opens up "Leafy Simulator". The fifteenth game made by
Jerry Lassa
and the nineteenth game overall, this is the least poorly-received game. However, it was criticized for being misleading, out-of-context, glitchy and nonsensical. The game is actually a long one:
The first part prompts you to choose between three backgrounds:
The Progressbar XB original background, which is copyrighted. Clicking it will make Leafy say "Copyright Alerte!" and leads to the system restarting.
A poorly drawn hill, which Leafy hates. Clicking it will make Leafy say "RFUGWHGYLLKZWWUV" and leads to a game over, which is basically a blank, white screen accompanied by
Jerry Lassa
saying "Game over, you idiot!". The game over always forces the player to start all over again from the first part.
A picture of Firey, which is the correct choice. Firey will say "Hey it's me Firey!". Leafy would then say "Yes, that idn't chaunt!", which would then trigger the next level.
The second part prompts you to choose a thing Leafy mentions, which is muted. The player will have to lip-sync her.
Clicking the wrong thing would make
Jerry Lassa
appear, stretch, and say "Congratumapumtumlations" and trigger the same game over screen that clicking the poorly drawn hill in the previous part leads you to.
Clicking the right thing would make Leafy say "Yes, canfera! Cengreksik! And gratulations!"
The third part consists of a random girl saying "Please help me, player!" The game then freezes as if it was about to crash.
Jerry Lassa
then says "We are sorry about that the game is experiencing some errors please replay again about one hour later it will be resolved." The game then crashes.
Playing less than one hour after
Jerry Lassa
's "We are sorry for the inconvenience" speech will actually restart the game.
Playing one houre or more after said speech will let the game continue to the fourth part.
List of prisoners in The Cosmicialverse Prison
[
]
Cephalopod of Nightmares: It was imprisoned so that this dangerous enemy will not be able to wreck havoc in the
Crustacianverse
. Its power couldn't be extracted, so it's forced to stay there forever, if not for a long time.
The Cosmicians Room has a generator section that generates an excessively high amount of cosmicians that are very powerful. The generator would then send them to an infinitely large section full of cosmicians. It has a closed door that, when a mission is active, would be open.
The kitchen of Death Valley is not necessarily a kitchen that was first built in Death Valley and was stolen by the three gods. Instead, the kitchen of Death Valley is named after Death Valley, the hottest place on earth. It instantly generates food that the customer needs, with no reachable limit. However, it also recognizes the limit of the customer, and warns them not to eat the food that surpasses their limit.
The Primordium Delta Zero Room is a huge room where all the primordium delta zero are generated. Once they are generated, they are sent to the core power increase the power of the
cosmicialverse
, without changing the reading of its power.
The Simulated Reality Room is a room with a machine that the user uses to set up the character that they're going to control (including how it looks and what its power is), which by default is an ordinary human being. They may also choose the location and the mission. Once the user finishes setting up the simulated reality, they go into the pod to start the simulated reality. The system then loads the simulated reality in another realm (which is this verse's fifth dimension) and teleports the player to that simulated reality, which has a starting point.
Locations
[
]
It has only two locations to choose from.
Cosmicialverse Zero
Thegatus Thirteen
Cosmicialverse Zero is the first location of the Simulated Reality Room. It looks very exact to the cosmicialverse (and the cosmicians army) if the first version of them were to exist (refer to the special feature below the regular trivia). Unlike the the actual
cosmicialverse
which is absurdly large, this one is only larger than an omniverse and smaller than The Box. It only has three dimensions, unlike the real one which has œâ
œâ
dimensions. And also, at the start, it only looks as if it was created 21 days, 23 hours and 9 minutes ago.
The cosmicialverse here has walls that are much weaker than the actual one's walls, and the electricity system here is much weaker than the actual
cosmicialverse
's one. It is also empty unlike the original one, consisting only of a generator which generates the cosmicians. This verse and its contents don't have a backstory at all, which means that it was created out of thin air.
NPCs
[
]
Enemy NPCs
Other NPCs
Cosmicians Army: The cosmicians working on the inside are Enemy NPCs. They are much stronger than the ones on the outside.
The Three Gods: They are fought in the Fight Kyle, Lassa and Flower mission.
The Three Gods: Unlike the real cosmicialverse gods, the cosmicialverse gods here only have the first two traits of the real ones. They also don't have the ability to have the cosmicians' abilities, and their strength doesn't have the ability to make the dead cosmicians count. They only have one goal as opposed to the real ones' two: To destroy dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities.
Kyle Rosse: The scientist of the three gods that's the kindest of the three, he is ten times as intelligent as Jerry Lassa and Aria Flower combined, knowing where to find materials and which material is the best one.
Jerry Lassa: The least popular and the defender of the three gods, he is the most useless of the three, only defending the cosmicialverse.
Aria Flower: The most popular and the powerhouse of the three gods, she is ten times as powerful as Kyle Rosse or Jerry Lassa (they're both equally powerful). She is active and aggresive despite being very appealing.
Cosmicians Army: Depending on the layer number, it could be so weak that nigh boundless gods can defeat them, or so powerful that even the most powerful cosmic entity, such as
Robert
, would be annihilated fighting them in seconds. Its basic purpose is to destroy dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities.
Layer 1 is the weakest cosmic entity classified as a cosmician. It is so weak, that nigh boundless gods can defeat them. However, it's still powerful enough to defeat some powerful cosmic entities, such as
Bean Man
. According to Kyle Rosse, it took a planck time to create these entities and send them to reality.
All of the abilities are common to every cosmician:
Transportation: Cosmicians can fly like a rocket without the need of an actual rocket and at layer 32 and beyond, they can even teleport.
Size change: Cosmicians can change from -(10^-100) meters to 10^-100 meters, though this will be 10 times wider every increasing layer.
Cosmician Ability Copy: This is perhaps one of the most iconic abilities of the cosmicians. They are able to copy the abilities of what cosmicians killed before they were killed, though the abilities' power may vary over cosmicians (they can be stronger or weaker).
Each cosmician (except layer 1 cosmicians) are ‚àû
(‚àû^^^^^‚àû)
&‚àû times bigger than the previous-layer cosmicians. They also have more powerful copied abilities and take 10 times longer than one of the previous-generation layer cosmicians to create. They also have an ability to summon (or more specifically, create) ‚àû
(‚àû^^^^^‚àû)
&‚àû previous-generation layer cosmicians that are ‚àû
(‚àû^^^^^‚àû)
&‚àû times faster than the cosmician who summoned them. They do the summoning in no time.
Missions
[
]
Raid the Cosmicialverse
Fight Rosse, Lassa and Flower
Raid the Cosmicialverse is probably the easiest mission. All you have to do is to beat up some cosmicians, steal some loot, destroy the cosmicialverse's core and escape. To compensate, a short time limit after destroying the cosmicialverse's core is induced.
This is the hardest mission, as these gods are absurdly powerful, if not nearly impenetrable.
Thegatus Thirteen is the second location of the simulated reality room. It looks exactly like
Thegatus
if the fourteenth (or the first finished) version were to be true.

Gameplay
[

In the simulated reality, you would act like the cosmic entity you are trying to do the mission you choose in the location you choose. The simulated reality ends when succeed in your mission or when you give up. When the game ends, you will be given points based on how well you did, how powerful is the character and how many times you took damage or even died. Unlike in actual reality, you can auto-revive 5 seconds after you die regardless of your character.

The Beginning
The Strong Cult
Glitchy Cosmos
Nix, The God of Chaos
Powerful, Destructive Gang
Cosmoses of Doom
Jerry Lassa's Revenge
After
Aria Flower
and
Jerry Lassa
's departure from their old job, the three gods decided to explore the cosmos and were lucky to find a container that contains 720
Primordium Deltas
. Each of them only ate 240 Primordium Deltas, but this gave them enough power to create the
Cosmicialverse
, and eventually the whole Cosmicians Army generator.
Aria Flower
did most of the work to build all this, while
Kyle Rosse
did all the planning and instructing.
Jerry Lassa
did very little to help
Aria Flower
. It took 4 OYC to finish all this. Once all this is done, the heroic age of the three gods begin.
The cosmicians army were initially less powerful, with the first layer cosmicians being so weak that most, if not all of the second everything layer entities can defeat these cosmicians with ease. However, even with this kind of strength and with little to no effort at all,
Aria Flower
,
Kyle Rosse
and the cosmicians army took down the chaos caused by dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities. They actually
overestimated
the dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities, which was why they were (and are) extremely powerful compared to even
Bob
and
Robert
. Two of the three gods were considered heroes -
Aria Flower
being the more loved hero.
However, there was one god who didn't do any work at all -
Jerry Lassa
. This causes him to be extremely hated, because there were so much chaos that were there for so much time.
Aria Flower
and
Kyle Rosse
decided to downgrade
Jerry Lassa
from having a mix of
Kyle Rosse
and
Aria Flower
's respective powers into being the weakest of the three gods (only having the base power), and modified everything so that he could not and did not need to do anything for the three gods.
Aria Flower
also stopped being friends with
Jerry Lassa
and despised him till this very day, when
Aria Flower
still despises
Jerry Lassa
for everything he did.
In 10,002 OYC,
Aria Flower
,
Kyle Rosse
and the cosmicians found a new enemy group called the Survival of The Fittest Cult. They were notorious for outright destroying trillions of weak cosmic entities, many of which were innocent. Their members had a variety of abilities, including creating black hole bombs and being able to make themselves invincible and invisible to every cosmic entity who doesn't have this power activated, many of which are what the two gods and the cosmicians didn't even know about. As a result, they had to defeat multiple powerful cosmic entities, such as Trara, an angelic male cosmic entity with the ability to create black hole bombs and Jade, a human-like female cosmic entity with the ability to make herself invincible and invisible.
These cosmic entities often take a lot of OYC to defeat, and are often extremely powerful. Luckily, the two gods are much more powerful, but this still took so long the Survival of The Fittest Cult had already killed quadrillions of weak cosmic entities. On 10,103 OYC,
Aria Flower
and
Kyle Rosse
are powerful enough to face the dangerous cult, so they finally went to one of the
multiverses
and stopped the Survival of The Fittest Cult.
However, the cult was much stronger than they anticipated. They defeated even the strongest layer cosmicians with no effort. As a result, they have to go back to the
cosmicialverse
to go to the ritual room, combining themselves into KRAF-2, an extremely strong cosmic entity that towers over all. With little and eventually no effort, they destroyed the Survival of The Fittest Cult, one member by one, until the last, which was the leader. The leader gave all his power to stop KRAF-2 to destroy him and the entire cult itself, but to no avail. Eventually, the cult was gone, and everyone, including the strong, was happy about it. KRAF-2 went to the cosmicialverse to finally split and deactivate the combination.
The story of the defeat of this extremely evil cult has made a lot of differences in the power and the capability of the cosmicians and the three gods. The first-layer cosmicians are now a lot stronger, even stronger than some of the second-layer everything gods. This, in turn, significantly strengthens the higher-layer cosmicians and the three gods. Many of the cosmicians have new abilities not available to them before, specifically the ones they've got from defeating the Survival of The Fittest Cult members. After that time, many evil cosmic entities have been afraid of the cosmicians and the three gods, and are turning good for the sake of these cosmic entities. Now, the three gods can relax, peacefully knowing that the chaos is now over. At least for now.
In 10,245 OYC,
Aria Flower
,
Kyle Rosse
and the cosmicians found a failed experiment floating around the cosmos. This was a failed experiment from Locke King, who wanted to create a cosmic entity who saves the world with no other tasks for it. The cosmic entity's name was Eugenie. The glitch was stronger than even the then-entire cosmicians army combined, and is capable of destroying everything it touches using its glitch disintegration, and even worse, converting them into a significantly stronger evil versions of them. Luckily,
Kyle Rosse
found one solution for
Aria Flower
to defeat Eugenie, which is to unglitch the glitched cosmic entities first. There is one question: "How long will it take?"
Aria Flower
went to the exact
hyperverse
the glitch was in. She did not fight the glitch itself, however instead tried to unglitch the glitched cosmic entities. She fought them to get the aliens' normal selves back. The problem with this solution, however, was that
Flower
would be more and more bored of unglitching the glitched, as this power gets less and less effective the more she uses it. Eventually,
Flower
began to be glitched by Eugenie, and all of this was not a good sign for the cosmos.
At first, she easily overcame the glitch, but a few minutes later,
Aria Flower
discovered she can no longer use her powers. Her power to do anything before, her power to unglitch the glitched. All gone. After another few minutes, the glitch became even worse, as she began losing control of her body. She can no longer control what she does and how she acts. Eventually,
Flower
knows that she's watching the end of her life, and the end of the cosmos. Losing her consciousness, she says goodbye to the world, thinking that she's fading away due to the glitch.
Kyle Rosse
, who was assisting
Flower
and whom
Flower
was communicating with the entire time, loses it.
Rosse
began to break down after the apparent death of his beloved fighter and cried so hard that he could be considered a crybaby (although he shouldn't).
All Eugenie does is making itself stronger and stronger, giving herself and her glitch army more and more power. The glitch army was getting bigger by army duplication, hyperverse infection, and eventually, the infection of the entire omniverse. This seemed like the end of the cosmicians army, the gods and the entire cosmos.
Kyle Rosse
knew that Eugenie would infect the entire cosmos, and he knew that he was currently watching the end of history.
However,
Melinda Ice
, who just saw it happen, came to the exact omniverse that was infected. She was traveling like she was teleporting, except that the objects were largely affected by her speed (thus she travels with care and dodges all of the objects to ensure no damage). With all her almighty power, she restored
the entire box
to its uninfected state, turning all the glitched into the unglitched, and obliterating Eugenie from all layers of existence and the entire cosmos.
Aria Flower
wakes up, wondering what just happened, then suddenly seeing
Melinda Ice
, the unoverpowerable defeater of the glitch. After getting along with her,
Ice
takes
Flower
to the
cosmicialverse
so that
Flower
could introduce her to
Kyle Rosse
. After hearing all the introduction to the unoverpowerable
Melinda Ice
,
Rosse
was extremely ecstatic to find someone who has the potential to be the fourth
cosmicialverse
god.
All the events of this chapter influence most of the future chapters.
Melinda Ice
joins the cosmicialverse gods group, becoming more powerful than any entity she could ever imagine. The two gods modified everything so that
Melinda Ice
could do anything for the three gods.
Jerry Lassa
is kicked out of the
cosmicialverse
due to his incompetency and laziness, being stripped of all the godly powers he had when he was in the
cosmicialverse
.
Aria Flower
now has a new job: To defend the
cosmicialverse
. Lastly,
Kyle Rosse
is now the upgrader of the
cosmicialverse
and its gods. Now, the two gods and the new god can relax, peacefully knowing that this horrible, horrible chaos is now over.
In 10,502 OYC,
Melinda Ice
,
Aria Flower
,
Kyle Rosse
and the cosmicians found a new enemy cosmic entity named Nix. So, this enemy cosmic entity is a dramatic one. Like the previous two enemy cosmic entities, this is a challenge cosmic entity for the
cosmicialverse
gods and the cosmicians. Just like the previous two enemy cosmic entities, the enemy cosmic entity has a chaotic evil intention and a well-thought out plan. However, unlike the previous two enemy cosmic entities, this one is very powerful, and it never stops getting more powerful. Though negative-sized, it has been shown to be more powerful than both the
cosmicialverse
and the
crustacianverse
combined-centonated.
To do this,
Melinda Ice
enlists the help of the
arcanums
. They are a group of little-known entities that are friends of
Melinda Ice
. The
arcanums
have a solution: a primordium delta zero.
Melinda Ice
, after saying thanks to the
arcanums
, uses trillions of primordium delta zeroes to empower the entire
cosmicialverse
, making the
cosmicians
and the
cosmicialverse
gods more powerful than
Big Cactus
, while their power reading suggests that the first-layer cosmicians are still weaker than
Harry
.
While
Melinda Ice
was fighting Nix, the
arcanums
and the
cosmicialverse
gods teamed up to create a primordium delta zero-based generator room that generates one billion primordium delta zeroes to empower the
cosmicialverse
. They also created a room where the
arcanums
could invent all kinds of things. It seemed like an instant to the humans. After just over one and a half human minutes of fighting Nix,
Melinda Ice
finally defeated Nix and returned to the
cosmicialverse
. The
cosmicialverse
gods and the
arcanums
were going to say something,
Melinda Ice
already knew what they did: Creating two useful rooms in the
cosmicialverse
.
All the events of this chapter has three impacts to the events after this chapter. The
cosmicialverse
was rehauled, the
cosmicialverse
team becomes stronger than ever and the
arcanums
have joined the
cosmicialverse
to help the cosmic entities.
A dossier of The Infinitum Gang Members is provided in "The Infinitus Gang Members" section for reference.
Story
The Infinitus Gang Members
The Introduction
[
]
In 11,780 OYC,
Melinda Ice
, along with her fellow groupmates,
Aria Flower
,
Kyle Rosse
, the cosmicians, and the
arcanums
, heard about a new threat to the cosmos whose job was to destroy the cosmos itself. Unlike the previous enemies, these people discovered these enemies late, as they already destroyed 0.1% of the cosmos. The threat was The Infinitus Gang, an omnipotent flock of destructive entities who are undefeatable. Each infinitum's power was over infinity times larger than the
cosmicialverse
, the
crustacianverse
, all the two verse's enemies and threats and all classified end-all-be-alls before this chapter combined-circulated-circulatonated-circulodariated. The leader was even stronger, having an enhanced power of all the members of the infinitums combined-circulated-circulatonated-circulodariated.
The Infinitus Gang had been notorious for many other horrifying incidents in the past, such as the infamous robbing of numerous cosmic entities, the attempted murder of numerous praised gods and even the use of
The Ripoff
to create identical copies of verses that, when entered, cause an explosion. Many cosmic entities and gods tried to defeat The Infinitus Gang but couldn't for common reasons: Either The Infinitus Gang were too powerful and strategic and the cosmic entity dies, or the cosmic entity or god was lazy and incompetent.
Luckily for the
cosmicialverse
itself, The
Arcanum
Tribe had recently finished upgrading the primordium delta zero machine, and they were introducing a more powerful product: The ultra primordium delta zero machine, which generates an ultra primordium delta zero, which is even more powerful than the primordium delta zero (see below). The machine also generates much, much faster than the original one, which is already absurdly fast. Even earlier, they introduced a completely different product called the Inglorium Killer, a product used to power the ultra primordium delta zero (see below). After building these,
Ice
was headed for the infinitomverse, the headquarters of the Infinitus Gang that were used for numerous purposes aforementioned.
A Long Battle
[
]
After arriving at the infinitomverse and temp-supergluing herself to its walls,
Melinda Ice
saw Damyel Grandia, Cliff Krystilla, Millie Kayblo, Hanzer Skarashima, Christopher Plutopha, Vita Jackson, James Hollywood, Nick Powstar, Aiden Anderson and Johnny Arc waiting for an intruder of the infinitomverse. After a few moments of thinking her strategy, she got in the entrance, alarming the eleven infinita in the entrance.
Melinda Ice
first barrier-blocks Damyel Grandia's yell (and Cliff Krystilla's depower attack) and sidecuts him. Then,
Ice
barrier-blocks Cliff Krystilla's depower attack and sidecuts, uppercuts and kicks him. Following that,
Ice
mirror-reflects Millie Kayblo's up, down and left lasers and penetrates her with two of the reflected lasers. Hanzer Skarashima, with no warning, puts a ball to shrink itself and crush
Ice
. However,
Ice
shatters the ball using reality warping and punches, kicks and slams Skarashima. Clark Andy uses his signature magic spell, which then gets blocked by
Ice
's quickly-made, but unbreakable blocking ball.
Ice
quickly crushes Andy's head with
Ice
's leg. Christopher Plutopha punches
Ice
three times before he pins her to the wall, ready to obliterate her with the magic of both fists. However,
Ice
blocks this by summoning a spikeball in his body and enlargening it. Vita Jackson revives the 6 members, but
Ice
uses an even deadlier version of Andy's signature magic spell to kill Jackson and her gangmates. After being tele-stomped by James Hollywood multiple times in quick succession,
Ice
attacks Hollywood using Plutopha's double fist trick. Nick Powstar then beats up
Ice
with a handful of brutal techniques. However, when he's about to use his final, most brutal technique,
Ice
kills him with his heart exploding. Aiden Anderson manipulates gravity to pull
Ice
, but this results in
Ice
punching him and then literally splitting his body in half. Finally, Johnny Arc fights
Ice
with all his might and power, even hurting
Ice
more than all previous attackers combined. However, he still fails -
Ice
eventually grabs him, splits his body into two separate legs, a torso split in half, two separate hands and a head split in half, and gets rid of all the parts from the infinitomverse.
While taking a breath,
Melinda Ice
was said to be thinking about how many ex-good people are members of the Infinitus Gang, knowing who they are in the past. She wondered who's behind all this. At first, she thought about
Jerry Lassa
, but she denied it as there was no way he would do that, considering that he's already demoted. Then, she thought about the leader of The Infinitus Gang. After that, she stopped thinking about that and got close to the door. She saw Henry Sterling, Claire Branford, Louis La Lasagna, Alex Lightnorth, George Black and Will Hohanna waiting for an intruder, and three doors leading to a different room. The door to the left leads to a gathering place for infinita to eat food, and includes Keith Von Haschberg, Reggie Le Omega, Mesh Kardeshev, Haltrem Lake, Allison Markins, Jefferson Crablight, Almond Flash, James Day Hellison, Clevitz Darksun, Armitza Remuzaelus, Joranca Liberiton, Ottoman Rodriguez, Adriel Anjanscio, Delark Sterrinson, Ron Deuvelis, Airy Eandelis and Macho Luniscense. The door to the right was a treasure and asset room locked with a very strong password. Finally, another door, which was the farthest from
Melinda Ice
, led to the huge main room that was complete with a huge stair that connected the huge room to the hallway. After thinking of a strategy,
Ice
opened the door and entered the hallway, leading to another battle.
Melinda Ice
first barrier-blocked Henry Sterling's drain attack and uppercuts him to the point of decapitating him. Claire Branford tries to subtract
Ice
's revive count, resulting in
Ice
killing Branford to get her revives back.
Melinda Ice
quickly drains Louis La Lasagna's power. La Lasagna laughs, only to realize that she is already immune to that kind of power a second later.
Melinda Ice
kicks him in the neck, decapitating him. Alex Lightnorth summons the eight gods that he enslaved. First, Fotia traps
Melinda Ice
with a "ball" made out of swords of fire, all of which are pointing in the center and makes the "ball" shrink.
Ice
quickly barrier-blocks all of them with a ball barrier. Next, Pagos traps
Ice
in a cold environment, complete with wind and lots of sharp glaciers.
Ice
is quick enough to block all of them with another ball barrier. After that,
Ice
is met by Astrapi, who summons an unbreakable wall surrounding her. He then summons barrages of lightning, expecting it to kill her. Unfortunately,
Ice
is already immune to it. Following that, Gi then traps
Ice
in an environment with a height limit and puts a deadly obstacle that should've killed her.
Ice
quickly destroys that obstacle by summoning a strange force that annihilates these kinds of obstacles.
Ice
then escapes from the obstacle until it no longer chases her, then summons a strange beam to destroy the rest of the obstacle. Anemos tries to blow
Ice
away with wind with some obstacles to help the wind, but
Ice
easily stands against all of the obstacles. Varytita turns the gravity up to eleven so that
Ice
will not be able to move and the giant metal ball will quickly crush her fatally. However,
Ice
is able to split the giant metal ball in half with her magic. Afterwards,
Ice
is met with Nero, who tries drown her by trapping her in a nigh-unbreakable container full of water. However, she manages to break out of the container and stun Nero. Finally, Ola Iscyhra summons a giant sword that in theory should be impossible to block, impossible to avoid, and has a massive amount of damage capable of stopping even the most powerful cosmic entities. However,
Ice
managed to teleport out of the sword's way.
Melinda Ice
then kicked Lightnorth in the middle of his torso, splitting his torso in half. Following the long attack, George Black tried to go to
Ice
's body, but
Ice
made him explode before he could get into the body. Finally, Will Hohanna tries to damage
Ice
, but
Ice
kills him with a deadly spell that's even more powerful than Clark Andy and Alex Lightnorth's spells combined.
This warned the seventeen infinita (see above) who were eating at the gathering place. First, Keith Von Haschberg tries to trap
Ice
by putting a spike trap, then makes the heavy falling object with spikes below it fall underneath
Ice
. Unfortunately for him, the trap wasn't effective and
Ice
kills him with a weaponless decapitation. Reggie Le Omega tries to kill her in a virtual infinitomverse, destroying large parts of the area. However,
Ice
dodges all his attacks and manages to kill him with ease, teleporting
Ice
herself back into the real world. Mesh Kardeshev tried to make
Ice
more powerless and himself more powerful, but the power backfired, thus doing it the other way. Haltrem Lake tried to stop
Ice
, but wait -
Ice
stopped him first! This allowed
Ice
to punch him in the head, making his head explode into pieces.
Ice
shot a disintegration beam at Allison Markins, but she created a portal to backfire this.
Ice
, however, moved the portal to backfire the backfiring of her attack, killing Markins instantly. Jefferson Crablight tried to kill
Ice
by saying "Win", but
Ice
punched Crablight through the heart before he could even finish the word. Almond Flash tried to kill
Ice
by clapping his hands, but
Ice
stopped him from clapping and killed him by crushing his head with both of her hands.
Ice
then killed James Day Hellison before he could get a chance to convert her. Clevitz Darksun tried to punch
Ice
, but
Ice
dodged and smashed her with a quickly-generated hammer. Armitza Remuzaelus smacked his sword, however
Ice
survived both the explosion and the implosion.
Ice
uppercut Remizaelus hard enough to decapitate him. Joranca Liberiton surrounded
Ice
with a large number of skulls, all facing her. However, she prepared a barrier to nullify the large beam these skulls shoot.
Ice
threw Liberton into the wall to the back, causing his body to break. Ottoman Rodriguez tried to kill
Melinda Ice
by staring, but to no avail as
Ice
brutally pinned him to the ground in a matter of seconds.
Ice
killed Adriel Anjanscio with the ground smasher. Delark Sterrinson tried to glitch
Ice
, but
Ice
kicked him in the head first. Ron Deuvelis managed to cause a bizzare environment change, but
Ice
threw him in the sky with magic before he could kill her with his sword and jumped into another position.
Ice
killed Airy Eandelis before she could even choose her powers. Macho Luniscense then beat up
Ice
so brutally that
Ice
almost died. Despite this,
Ice
managed to win by saying "Win" to Luniscense, killing him.
The Infinitus Gang's End
[
]
With all of the thirty-four infinita killed,
Melinda Ice
closed off the all the gaps to make sure it doesn't look scary, and rested in Macho Luniscense's body, healing herself. While resting, she was said to be thinking about how every single cosmic entity here were more powerful than the cosmic entities they've faced before, and remembered that the Eugenie incident was not a threat at all. Apparently, these guys were so powerful that they've took all her energy to fight. Then, she thought about
Aria Flower
,
Kyle Rosse
, The
Arcanum
Tribe members, and the cosmicians. Are they okay? What if they're not? Is the
cosmicialverse
safe? Only fate knows if it's safe. After eleven minutes of thinking,
Joey Klindel
, the leader of The
Arcanum
Tribe, called via the RedIO-‚àû74 to ask
Ice
if she was okay.
Ice
said she was okay, and asks him if the
cosmicialverse
was okay. He said they're okay. He then informed her that he already hired a mysterious guy named Aaron Kulanda to give all these things in the portable pocket (that The
Arcanum
Tribe had built) to their owners. If the owner didn't want it back or was dead,
Melinda Ice
could keep them in her RedIO-‚àû74.
Ice
then proceeded to empty the rooms, delete the dead bodies and blood, and loot everything else. She then went to the treasure and asset room and loot all the assets and treasures. Afterwards, she morphed into Macho Luniscense and go to the door that leads to the huge main room.
Shortly after descending huge steps of stairs, "Macho Luniscense" (AKA
Melinda Ice
) turned left to go to the Electricity Room, only to be greeted by The Infinitus Gang's co-leader, Jarvis Elevan Lustre. When the co-leader said "How was your meal?", "he" said that it's great, even though "he" had to fight against an intruder that "he" doesn't really know. "He" also told the co-leader that "he" would be working on electrical. The co-leader says "talk to you later" to "him" and went away. "Luniscense" then went to the Electricity Room to work on electrical (Yep, "he" actually worked on it.). "He" did an excellent job at doing it. While not surprised, Joliscia Ealina once again praised "Luniscense" for doing an excellent job. After getting praised, "he" went to the lounge and waited for a few minutes. "He" thought about how these people are actually nice. Despite this, "he" still needs to destroy The Infinitus Gang. After about four minutes of thinking, "He" teleported "himself" into the Core Power Room, where the Trevor Calcium Jorriden controlled everything and where the power core was kept. While Jorriden was working to make sure everyone and everything were okay, "Macho Luniscense" said "hello" to Jorriden, who then asked "Luniscense" about how "he" got here. "Luniscense" then revealed that "he" wasn't Macho Luniscence. As "his" body and "his" clothes slowly morphed into that of
Melinda Ice
's, "he" revealed "his" true identity to Jorriden:
Melinda Ice
. Jorriden realized that she was the one who breached into the infinitomverse. Just when he was about to call security,
Melinda Ice
locked the door and strengthened the walls, the floor and the ceiling of the room. Realizing that he couldn't call his members, Jorriden got furious and started fighting her with all he got.
Unfortunately for him, Jorriden's powerful attacks now don't even affect
Melinda Ice
.
Ice
delivers a mighty punch, launching Jorriden into a wall to the point that he suffered an injury. While Jorriden was recovering,
Ice
destroyed the power core with the most powerful light beam, effectively rendering all the infinita worthless. After making other infinita unconscious and looting everything in the infinitaverse (which took 10 seconds),
Ice
set up a bunch of disintegration beams, destroying the infinitomverse and all the infinita who hadn't been killed inside.
Ice
went back to the
cosmicialverse
and delivered all the loot to Aaron Kulanda, who later gave it to everyone. Fortunately for
Ice
, most of them were not from anyone who were alive, allowing her to keep most of the loot in her RedIO-‚àû74. With another chapter being completed, the
cosmicialverse
team becomes unstoppable and no new cosmos threats and
cosmicialverse
stoppers are available due to the cosmic entities' fear. The cosmos was restored, though not with a huge trace of destruction from The Infinitus Gang, who is remembered as the most powerful threat yet. The
cosmicialverse
gods will forever be known as the greatest heroes of history.
Damyel Grandia: An infinitus that was capable of killing
Aria Flower
with just his regular yell and is immune to extremely loud sounds. In his early days, he heard a few earrapes while watching videos on TV. After watching a few earrapes, Grandia became interested in earrape, leading him to watch earrape videos. He bought a tablet, opened up MyVideo and watches hundreds of earrape videos. Eventually, he himself mastered a yell that's louder than a Krakatoa volcanic eruption and becomes immune to extremely loud sounds.
Cliff Krystilla: An infinitus that was capable of depowering all entities, including
Gerald
and
Melinda Ice
. Back then, when he just wants to be an extraordinary man, many cosmic entities kept depowering him because he is power-greedy. However, Krystilla overcame this by coming up with an extreme solution to be immune from depowering, and eventually depower literally every other cosmic entity, including
Gerald
. Eventually, he got revenge on those cosmic entities by depowering them and killing them.
Millie Kabylo: An infinitus that was capable of completely altering reality. In her teenage years, she repeatedly said that reality sucked. So, she sets out a journey to find a very rare particle that will let her change reality. Lucky for her, Kayblo finds that particle after a few years and she was finally able to shape reality to what she wants. She is able to make reality perfect for her and can do horrible things to whoever made reality bad for her. Eventually, Kayblo was able to be happy in life and was now able to live a fully controlled life.
Hanzer Skarashima: An infinitus that was capable of destroying even the biggest verses and the most powerful cosmic entities with just a size-varying ball that instantly shrinks. Before joining The Infinitus Gang, he was a writer. In all of his stories about the cosmos, he always dreams of someone who can destroy everything with a ball that instantly shrinks. He accidentally made his imagination into reality by mere chance. Now, he can destroy verses with a lot of his all his enemies at will, and he can now destroy enemies that get in their way.
Clark Andy: An infinitus that was capable of torture-killing cosmic entities whose power is unfathomable to most people. In his youth, he was always getting very hurt, and is somehow not dead. He finally got fed up and decided to abandon his school. Sometime after this, he eventually found a blue, strange ball with a white glow. It ended up being integrated to his body, never to be seen again. When the same "old friends" were attacking him again, the attacks fail and he used his signature magic spell for the very first time. He was never seen casting that magic spell until when he joins The Infinitus Gang.
Cristopher Plutopha: An infinitus that was capable of slowing time down by not moving at his fastest, along with making people shatter by pointing both his fists at them. In his youth, he used to play a lot of video games. One day, he bought his first (and only) VR game,
Hypercold VR
. During his experience, he noted that the game is very interesting and the VR game was well-made. After the ending, the TV, the VR and the lighting system stops working. He wonders why. He tested physics with the VR and it slowed down until he catched it. To other people, he was always seen moving at his fastest.
Vita Jackson: An infinitus that was capable of reviving a lot of friends with magic, and with power that's much more powerful than her. Earlier in her life, she never met any proper people other than what would later become her best friend, John Lumanda. However, she found out why: her best friend killed everyone in the world and decided to take the bodies to where she would never see them. She was hurt by that and she built a rocket to never let this happen again. (Her now-former best friend was then killed by
Gerald
because of his destructiveness and his abuse of power given by
Gerald
.)
James Hollywood: An infinitus that was capable of stopping time until he touches something else. Before joining The Infinitus Gang, he is an actor of the (now-finished)
Colossal Columbian
series, which featured Colossal Columbian, the main character of the series capable of using a similar power. Long after the
Colossal Columbian
series was finished, he got into a fight which was similar to an action move fight. At some point, he gets a power that's similar to Colossal Columbian's. He eventually began took advantage of that power shortly before joining The Infinitus Gang.
Nick Powstar: An infinitus that was capable of dealing fatal blows to
Big Cactus
with just his body. From his youth, he is a fan of
Cosmic Combat
, a fighting game that is famous for including excessive gore, an extremely dark story and most importantly, a pack of brutal finishing moves called "Fatalities". He sometimes wished he could be one of them. Sometime in his adulthood before joining The Infinitus Gang, he got his wish: He is capable of dealing fatal blows to nigh boundless gods just with his body. He has a curse of not knowing how to use a single weapon.
Aiden Anderson: An infinitus that was capable of increasing gravity to kill a human. In his youth, many objects dropped in his head (though few of which are actually fatal). Eventually, he decided to learn gravity, experiment with it and eventually manipulate gravity. Eventually, it became his main tool for solving problems. He was known as a gravity-based hero in a planet without a name. He stopped The Infinitus Gang a lot of times before joining himself, battling against the leader himself. After proving his worth, he decides that he is worthy of joining The Infinitus Gang.
Johnny Arc: An infinitus that was capable of using an extremely powerful version of the dead infinita's powers, making him the strongest of all the infinita in the entrance. Back in his youth, he had a habit of avenging someone's death by brutally murdering their killer. This causes him to be jailed so many times, of varying years. At 35 years old, he joined The Infinitus Gang to not only use an extremely powerful version of the dead infinita's powers, but to also stop himself from getting imprisoned. He was considered a superior infinitum compared to all of the infinita guarding the entrance in this chapter.
Henry Sterling: One of the two infinita guarding the left door (the other one being Louis La Lasgna), blessed with the power of Johnny Arc circulatodariated by infinity just in case Arc ever dies. Other than this power, Sterling is also bestowed with the power of draining power of even the most powerful cosmic entities. In early life, gods kept torturing him for no reason, because he is deemed a threat. As a result, he got revenge by disguising as one of the trusted humans to fool his primary god into giving him the power to drain other cosmic entities' powers. However, he later betrays the primary god, because he made all this happen. Afterwards, he finally exacted revenge on the gods for torturing him for no reason.
Claire Branford: One of the two infinita guarding the right door (the other being George Black), blessed with the power of Johnny Arc circulatodariated by infinity just in case Arc ever dies. Other than this power, Branford is also bestowed with the power to add or subtract to select cosmic entities' revives, including her own. In early life, she wondered how gods could revive themselves and humans couldn't. After a long time of wondering, she devised her current power to add or substract cosmic entities' lives to help humans.
Louis La Lasagna: One of the two infinita guarding the left door (the other one being Henry Sterling), blessed with the power of Johnny Arc circulatodariated by infinity just in case Arc ever dies. Other than this power, La Lasagna is also bestowed with the power to absorb and learn power every time anyone attacks him. In early life, every time he heard about a fight to the death competition, he joined them. He won none of them, due to him parring with stronger, more powerful cosmic entities. Due to this, he decided to research about power. Eventually he came across this ability, which allows for the user to absorb and learn power every time anyone attacks him. From then on, he won every fighting competition, up until he retired to join The Infinitus Gang.
Alex Lightnorth: One of the two infinita guarding the farthest door (the other being Will Hohanna), blessed with the power of Johnny Arc circulatodariated by infinity just in case Arc ever dies. Other than this power, Lightnorth is also bestowed with two powers: The power to enslave a god and the power to call his slave gods to brutally torture the intruder until he dies. In early life, he got bullied and beaten up at school. He was hating his life due to the horrible children at school. This is, until he gets across a news about the mysterious powerful ball. He eventually grabs the ball - this causes him to have two powers, both of which are extremely powerful. He enslaved Fotia, Pagos, Astrapi, Gi, Anemos, Varytita, Nero, and Ola Ischyra, and use the powerful gods to his advantage every time he gets beaten up or bullied.
George Black: One of the two infinita guarding the right door (the other being Claire Branford), blessed with the power of Johnny Arc circulatodariated by infinity just in case Arc ever dies. Other than this power, Black is also bestowed with the power to kill people from the inside. Before joining The Infinitus Gang, he was a hero who watched several series of films about a hero being able to kill people from the inside. Seeing these movies, he wished he could have that power, saying that it would've been a killer ability for his job. Later in his life, he found a villain which was so unstoppable, no hero could've beaten him. He decided to stop the villain by using the suddenly-given power to kill people from the inside. He uses it to kill the villain. The hero was deemed the best hero (until he joined The Infinitus Gang).
Will Hohanna: One of the two infinita guarding the farthest door (the other being Alex Lightnorth), capable of using an circulatodariatially powerful version of the dead infinita's powers, making him the strongest of all the infinita in the hallway. Like Johnny Arc, Hohanna had a habit of avenging people in a deadly way. Unlike Arc, however, Hohanna manages to evade arrest, due to the power being already in his hands, allowing him to avenge even more people in a manner that's very deadly. At 42 years old, he joined The Infinitus Gang.
Keith Von Haschberg: An infinitus who was last known to be in the gathering place, he was busy trying to finish his fried rice there. He was blessed with the powers of Johnny Arc and Will Hohanna combined-circulatodariated circulatodariated by infinity just in case Arc ever dies, along with the power to put unexpected traps in the intruder's way. In early life, he likes to prank people by putting in unexpected pranks. He researched more unexpecting and fear-inducing pranks that are harmless and eventually comes across a magic trick that'll make a prank not obvious. After joining The Infinitus Gang, he puts his power into more serious situations.
Reggie Le Omega: An infinitus who was last known to be in the gathering place, he was busy trying to finish his roasted turkey there. He was blessed with the powers of Johnny Arc and Will Hohanna combined-circulatodariated circulatodariated by infinity just in case Arc ever dies, along with the power to initiate a virtual reality version of the infinitomverse and fight the intruder in it, destroying the virtual environment while killing the intruder.

,
R.Y.A.N. 2: r.y.a.n. returns
,
R.Y.A.N. 3: world of hatred
, and the unreleased
R.Y.A.N. 4: don't mess with the clock

He was blessed with the powers of Johnny Arc and Will Hohanna combined-circulatodariated circulatodariated by infinity just in case Arc ever dies, along with the power to clap really hard to make the intruder explode with the intruder he wants to explode in mind. In his childhood, he was always been a fan of explosions and was always using grenades and bombs to kill people. Due to this,
Alphasm

Because of this, she was granted by the wrestler leader the Wrestler's Reward, a ball that, once used, will grant the user regular punch and kick attacks that are as powerful as a missile. Consequently, she was retired from being a wrestler and had the decision to join The Infinitus Gang.
Armitza Remuzaelus: An infinitus who was last known to be in the gathering place, he was busy trying to finish his weird french fries there.

Since his childhood, he was a fan of Cosmos Fantasy, a role-playing game with various fantasies to tell. One of his favorite features are the Limit Breaks, which are the playable characters' most powerful attacks. Later, he got the power to smack his sword hard, which causes an explosion, followed by an implosion.
Joranca Liberiton: An infinitus who was last known to be in the gathering place, he was busy trying to finish his fried noodles there.

Adriel Anjanscio: An infinitus who was last known to be in the gathering place, he was busy trying to finish his sausage and eggs there. He was blessed with the powers of Johnny Arc and Will Hohanna combined-circulatodariated circulatodariated by infinity just in case Arc ever dies, along with the power to instantly kill any omnipotent cosmic entity when their body touches him. During his time in The Infinitus Gang, he wondered why some end-all-be-alls have to exist and what are their purposes. However, this question was abandoned with the acquisition of the power to instantly kill any omnipotent cosmic entity when their body touches him, making himself very powerful.
Delark Sterrinson: An infinitus who was last known to be in the gathering place, he was busy trying to finish his cake there. He was blessed with the powers of Johnny Arc and Will Hohanna combined-circulatodariated circulatodariated by infinity just in case Arc ever dies, along with the power to glitch intruders he wants to glitch in mind. Before joining The Infinitus Gang, he was known for being the most trusted video game glitch finder, having found a total of 11,000 glitches. Later, the
alphasm
gives him the power to glitch the person he wants to glitch in mind. Sterrinson's ability was joked as "unstable".
Ron Deuvelis: An infinitus who was last known to be in the gathering place, he was busy trying to finish his warm potato wedges there. He was blessed with the powers of Johnny Arc and Will Hohanna combined-circulatodariated circulatodariated by infinity just in case Arc ever dies, along with the power to create a bizarre structure just to stab an intruder. Unfortunately, this power wasn't connected to any part of his childhood. However, he was a master of giant swords, wielding them as if they are a normal sword. He was said to have fought like this in his entire fighting career.
Airy Eandelis: An infinitus who was last known to be in the gathering place, she was busy trying to finish her miso soup there. She was blessed with the powers of Johnny Arc and Will Hohanna combined-circulatodariated circulatodariated by infinity just in case Arc ever dies, along with the power to combine two powers of cosmic entities that are found inferior to The Infinitus Gang's members. Before joining The Infinitus Gang, she was a hero who can choose two powers of cosmic entities she has already defeated. She was one of her verse's greatest heroes until she joined The Infinitus Gang.
Macho Luniscense: An infinitus who was last known to be in the gathering place, he was busy trying to finish his chilli there. He was blessed with the powers of all the dead infinita's powers, making him the strongest of all the infinita in the gathering place. Like Johnny Arc and Will Hohanna, Luniscense had a habit of avenging people in a deadly way, and like Johnny Arc, he ended up getting arrested a lot of times, each with varying years. Eventually, he decided to join The Infinitus Gang to stop this from happening for good.
Jarvis Elevan Lustre: The co-leader of The Infinitus Gang, he is nice to his teammates. Unfortunately, due to The Infinitus Gang's action, he was a self-proclaimed bad guy who is inhumane, unforgiving, brutal, and chaotic. Despite this, he is kind at heart to members of The Infinitus Gang and truly cares for them. In early life, he and Trevor Calcium Jorriden found The Infinitus Gang at 10,420 OYC, along with 17 different members, 14 of them dead or left before this chapter. The Infinitus Gang was a very successful gang, because they managed to be unstoppable when destroying the cosmos. At least until now.
Joliscia Ealina: The boss of The Infinitus Gang's members who worked on the electrical (including Macho Luniscense). She was one of the 17 different members who founded The Infinitus Gang. She was one of The Infinitus Gang's most trusted boss. She has a strong bond with Macho Luniscense because he did the best job out of all The Infinitus Gang's members who worked on the electrical.
Trevor Calcium Jorriden: The leader of The Infinitus Gang, he is serious, confident, pure inhumane, unforgiving, brutal, chaotic, hatred-driven, annoying, and power-greedy - Yes, everything a typical Big Bad is. Unlike most other The Infinitus Gang members, he was evil from his birth. He was so evil that no one wanted to be friends with him. At one point, he slept for half an hour in his job, probably because he underslept some time ago. As the leader, he's supposed to monitor, lead, command, and help everyone - and he did them well.
In 11,015 OYC, The Arcanum Tribe has just finished the third version of the Primordium Delta Zero line: the Super Primordium Delta Zero.
Melinda Ice
and her friends are extremely bored, because there are no people to save and all they can do is to live "happily ever after" without anything to do.
Kyle Rosse
suggests exploring unknown verses in the second realm. They did that, and... they were still bored.
Aria Flower
suggests getting interesting things scattered across the cosmos. They did that, and... nope. While they got a good amount of artifacts, they were still bored.
Joey Klindel
suggested saving the cosmoses outside this cosmos. Unfortunately, his plan was far too ridiculous to execute, due to the barrier this cosmos has.
Ice
asks
Klindel
about how they're going to do it.
Klindel
says that it's simple - they will seek approval from
EpicAlexisMaxwell
. When the
cosmicialverse
gods ask
EpicAlexisMaxwell
for access to other cosmoses,
EpicAlexisMaxwell
says no. They tried multiple times, even giving a reason, until
EpicAlexisMaxwell
finally said that he will accept the challenge if
Melinda Ice
beats a clone of her made by him that is a bit stronger than Ice in purpose. Thus, the battle between
Melinda Ice
and the clone begins...
This clone first put a meteor that
Melinda Ice
shouldn't avoid, which
Melinda Ice
blocked.
Melinda Ice
then kicked the clone in the stomach. Then, the clone puts a powerful force to blow
Melinda Ice
away, catched her, then prepared an attack to defeat
Melinda Ice
. However,
Melinda Ice
then weakened it and using an even more powerful force to blow him once and for all. Then, once the clone hits the wall,
Melinda Ice
mightily punched it 100 times, each hand doing 50 of them (kind of specific ngl), before finishing him off with the same meteor that the clone first used.
EpicAlexisMaxwell
finally accepted
Melinda Ice
's request after seeing her do something so impressive, asking permission from four active administrator-bureaucrats to let them to their respective wikis' cosmoses.
The next day, EpicAlexisMaxwell informed them that, out of the four cosmoses, the Verse and Dimensions cosmos rejected the
cosmicialverse
. However, the Beyond Universe cosmos, the Fuzzo's Cosmology cosmos, and the Ultimas Cosmology cosmos was available to the
cosmicialverse
. EpicAlexisMaxwell then ordered them to go and have a nice visit. The
cosmicialverse
then traveled at an extremely fast speed. After 1 minute of non-stop traveling, they finally went outside the All Dimensions cosmos for the first time ever.
The Ultimas Cosmology cosmos
[
]
The first cosmos that was visited by the
cosmicialverse
was the Ultimas Cosmology cosmos. This big cosmos seems to be an empty yet very interesting cosmos. While only containing a few things, all of these things seem to have an interesting structure and an interesting backstory. Even the nature of the cosmos itself is interesting. However, there was one cosmic entity that has recently been a threat to the Ultimas Cosmology cosmos: The AX-390-5572R. It is a robot monster with hundreds of sharp teeth, along with a metallic body. It also has a circular saw attached to its right hand, along with a dragon face attached to its left hand. It also has sharp things hidden in both of its legs. It has two eyes to tell if it was doing something or feeling someething. This cosmic entity is also able to repair itself, which seems to be the only ability associated with magic.
Melinda Ice
fires a bunch of laser beams, which damaged the AX-390-5572R. The AX-390-5572R uses the dragon face on its left hand to surround
Ice
, then uses its right hand to cut her in half. However,
Ice
successfully dodges the attack.
Ice
then uses Fotia, Pagos, Astrapi, Gi, Anemos, Varytita, Nero, and Ola Ischyra to put a finishing blow on it, but the AX-390-5572R defended against all of them. The AX-390-5572R then summons hundreds of hyper-dangerous missiles to shoot her, and it does an extreme amount of damage to
Ice
.
Ice
was eventually forced to summon a massive laser beam to damage the AX-390-5572R even more. However, the AX-390-5572R counterattacked by summoning his minions, damaging
Ice
more. Thus,
Ice
and AX-390-5572R attacked with their most powerful attack on each other. AX-390-5572R used a huge missile that's even more damaging than before. However, it was already too weak for
Ice
.
Ice
finished the AX-390-5572R with a green bomb, causing a huge explosion, killing AX-390-5572R.
Joey Klindel
said that the situation is clear, which then prompted
Ice
to return to the
cosmicialverse
, waiting for what comes next. The
cosmicialverse
then left this cosmos.
The Fuzzo's Cosmology cosmos
[
]
The next cosmos that was visited by the
cosmicialverse
was the Fuzzo's Cosmology cosmos. This small cosmos has a little bit more things. The nature of the cosmos itself is positively weird and creative, with some positively strange things that are nothing like the other wikis. Hmm... Anyway, there was one threat to the Fuzzo's Cosmology cosmos, and this threat was much bigger than the one in the Ultimas Cosmology cosmos. This threat was The F82 Group. They're a large group of 124 aliens, each even stronger than the AX-390-5572R in the Ultimas Cosmology cosmos. Unlike The Infinitus Gang, all of the abilities are distributed to all aliens, making them even stronger than any of the threats the
cosmicialverse
has ever faced. Like The Infinitus Gang, they are entities created to destroy the cosmos, and they've already destroyed 10% of them.
Melinda Ice
,
Aria Flower
, and
Kyle Rosse
knew that they had to go to the Ritual Room and do the ritual in order to destroy The F82 Group. As a result, they were combined into KRAFMI-3, the most powerful being capable of destroying the most powerful cosmic entities with even its punch. As a result, the 124 aliens were powerless to KRAFMI-3. They tried to work together to defeat the KRAFMI-3, but to no avail. The KRAFMI-3 easily defeats the 124 aliens by trapping them and killing them with a very powerful bomb with the 124 aliens not being able to do anything. They then split back and try to escape the cosmos fast. Eventually, the 124 aliens were completely destroyed by the bomb, with no part of the cosmos being destroyed.
The Beyond Universe cosmos
[
]
The last cosmos that was visited by the
cosmicialverse
was the Beyond Universe cosmos. Unlike the other two, this one was a big cosmos with lots of unique stuff. It was similar to the All Dimensions cosmos, allowing them to adapt to this cosmos much quicker. As usual, there was one threat to this cosmos, and this threat was even stronger than the two previous threats, making it one of the biggest threats the
cosmicialverse
had ever faced. This threat was The Rhymodium, and it had already destroyed 5% of the cosmos. To explain its strength, The Rhymodium was stronger than all end-all-be-alls and all omnipotent cosmic entities combined. So, the
cosmicialverse
gods went to the ritual room to combine to the KRAFMI-3 once more.
The KRAFMI-3 and The Rhymodium fought each other, each attacking with an attack that's more powerful than the last opponent's attack. The KRAFMI-3 attacked with a huge sword, causing The Rhymodium to be injured. The Rhymodium then attacked with two dual electric saws, causing KRAFMI-3 to be even more injured. The KRAFMI-3 countered with an infinitely powerful magic, causing The Rhymodium to be even more injured. The Rhymodium then countered with infinite-sized meteors, each dealing massive damage, causing the KRAFMI-3 to be even more injured. The KRAFMI-3 then fought back by surrounding The Rhymodium with an all-powerful explosion meteor, causing The Rhymodium to have a severe injury. The Rhymodium then fought back with a deadly grenade, which starts off weak but quickly becomes so massive it might as well destroy 90% of the cosmos. It caused KRAFMI-3 to have a serious injury. Eventually, the KRAFMI-3 couldn't take it anymore, and attacked with the most powerful attack the cosmoses have ever seen. It is a blade that explodes when it stabs a cosmic entity.
The Rhymodium died, and the KRAFMI-3 then splitted back to the
cosmicialverse
gods, who would then go to the
cosmicialverse
and return back to the All Dimensions cosmos, their home cosmos. While this fifth chapter didn't change a lot of things, this chapter gives it access to all other cosmoses, giving it more advantage than most end-all-be-alls and most
Randomuser66
entities.
Taking place in 11,363 OYC, Jerry Lassa, a former cosmicialverse god, is getting his own revenge on the cosmicialverse gods for exiling him. As a smart human being who consumed a lot of primordium deltas, he knows all about the cosmicialverse's enemies. He decided to revive them to destroy the cosmos, and later the cosmosplex, once and for all. Together, they form a flock of destructive entities that are unstoppable to the cosmos by itself, and can easily wipe out an omniverse by itself in an instant.
Luckily, the cosmicialverse has just reached quadrillions of cosmoses away from the cosmos. However, they are no match to the powerful group made by Jerry Lassa, especially Jerry Lassa himself. They have to face the horrible nostalgia that the cosmicialverse faces while taking on Jerry Lassa, the former disloyal cosmicialverse god whom they exiled 1,100 OYC ago. It's all or nothing, everyone!
Inhabitants
[
]
Cosmicians Army
[
]
The cosmicians are armies of really powerful entities. They are really, really powerful. Heck, so powerful that even beyond boundless gods won't be able to annihilate them. They are generated at a special generator at the Cosmicialverse. They are created by the three original gods, though
Jerry Lassa
did next to nothing to create it.
How do they work?
[
]
Depending on the layer number, it could be so weak that even some of the second everything layer gods can defeat them, or so powerful that even many of the so-called end-all-be-all entities would be annihilated fighting them in seconds. Their basic purposes are to destroy dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities, and to make life better for good cosmic entities, whether weak or strong.
Layer 1
Common Abilities
Higher-layer cosmicians
Layer 1 is the weakest cosmic entity classified as a cosmician. It is so weak, that some of the second everything layer gods can defeat them. However, it's still powerful enough to defeat all of the second everything layer cosmic entities (though not all at once), such as
Bean Man
. According to Kyle Rosse, it took a planck time to create these entities and send them to reality.
All of the abilities are common to every cosmician:
Transportation: Cosmicians can fly like a rocket without the need of an actual rocket and at layer 32 and beyond, they can even teleport.
Size change: Cosmicians can change from -(10^-100) meters to 10^-100 meters, though this capability will be 10 times wider every increasing layer.
Cosmician Ability Copy: This is perhaps one of the most iconic abilities of the cosmicians. They are able to copy the abilities of what cosmicians killed before they were killed, though the abilities' power may vary between cosmicians (they can be stronger or weaker, depending on the cosmician's strength).
Each cosmician (except layer 1 cosmicians) are ‚àû
(‚àû^^^^^‚àû)
&‚àû times bigger than the previous-layer cosmicians. They also have more powerful copied abilities and take 10 times longer than one of the previous-generation layer cosmicians to create. They also have an ability to summon (or more specifically, create) ‚àû
(‚àû^^^^^‚àû)
&‚àû previous-generation layer cosmicians that are ‚àû
(‚àû^^^^^‚àû)
&‚àû times faster than the cosmician who summoned them. They do the summoning in no time.
Layer 25 cosmicians can create anything in a planck time. The time created will be divided by 10 for each layer. For each 50 layers, cosmicians have an additional self-revive. They, however, have to auto-revive in the last place they died. They will be invincible for 5 seconds after the first auto-revive, and the number of seconds will be exponentiated by 5 every subsequent time they die.
Cosmicialverse Gods
[
]
Properties
[
]
All of them have the same properties:
They are gods, but they look and act like human beings. They look like humans who are the size and the voice of an adult and the look of a preteen. They are, however, very mature (with the exception of Jerry Lassa) when it comes to destroying dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities.
They are all considered the most powerful cosmic entities. Each of them have the combined-exponentiated powers of all the cosmicians generated (that is in such a way that they are more powerful), including dead ones. Unlike the cosmicians, they are constantly getting more and more powerful and having more and more abilities.
Each of them has an extremely powerful tablet running an extremely powerful operating system, protected with a password so secure, no cosmic entity or even the other two gods could guess or even pass through it.
Unlike the cosmicians, which have a limited amount of self-revives, all of the three gods start with ‚àû
(‚àû^^^^^‚àû)
&‚àû self-revives. The number of self-revives is always being exponentiated by ‚àû
(‚àû^^^^^‚àû)
&‚àû in just 10^(10^100)th of a planck time, and the speed of self-revives is always being exponentiated by ‚àû
(‚àû^^^^^‚àû)
&‚àû every time the one of the three gods die. Also, unlike the cosmicians, which are forced to auto-revive in the place they died in, all of the three gods can choose where do they want to revive in. This system is fixed and can only be changed by the three gods themselves. This fact can't be changed by every cosmic entity.
They can create anything, including verses, generators and other cosmic entities in basically no time.
They have the abilities of the cosmicians, except they're much, much stronger.
After chapter 4, they absorb the power of everything they can do.
They have two goals: To destroy dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities, and to make life better for good cosmic entities, whether weak or strong.
RedIO-‚àû74, their main tool
[
]
RedIO-‚àû74, colloquially known as
cosmicialverse
tablets, are the main tools that the
cosmicialverse
gods use for a variety of tasks that they will not be doing with their own powers.
Tablet Specifications
Cosmos Enemy Finder
Game Maker
All-Powerful Storage
Because of their absurdly impossible technology, the
cosmicialverse
gods are able to create impossibly stable tablets that can do much, much more than even the most versatile mainframe computers. Each of them has a flash memory and RAM that are both absurdly big, impossibly fast and eternally durable. Each of them has an impossibly perfect camera and an ideal yet unpixelated display. These CPUs, GPUs and sound cards are impossibly perfect. They are also impossible to destroy and is made out of the same material that they used to build the
cosmicialverse
.
Each of the tablets run an operating system called Lumedi-X OS, with the base operating system made by
Kyle Rosse
and the rest of the operating system made by the
cosmicialverse
's core power. It is extremely enjoyable, impressively polished and absurdly immortal. It is the most versatile operating system ever made, due to a lot of extreme features and a majority of known programs being able to run on the OS.
With the
cosmicialverse
's core power, these specifications get circulatially better and better every planck time.
Brief History: While deciding for what computer should they be using, the
cosmicialverse
gods had three options: A laptop, a tablet and a smartphone. However, a laptop seemed a little too heavy, while a phone seemed too small and featureless. So, they decided to go with the tablet and made it to become one of the most powerful tablets in the cosmos.
Cosmos Enemy Finder is an automatic program that, when found, is a finder that finds any cosmos enemy and tries to analyze it as accurately as possible.
Threat Level
[
]
The Cosmos Enemy Finder uses a measure called threat levels. It determines how strong an enemy is.
Level
Description
minimum
An extremely trivial threat level, Threat Level "minimum" indicates that the threat's nothing compared to the layer-1 to layer-42 cosmicians. The
cosmicialverse
, of course, sends layer-1 to layer-42 cosmicians.
trivial
A very trivial threat level, Threat Level "trivial" indicates that the threat's quite weak compared to the layer-42 cosmicians. The
cosmicialverse
still sends layer-1 to layer-42 cosmicians.
Mild
A trivial threat level, Threat Level "Mild" indicates that the threat's getting serious. It indicates that
Aria Flower
needs to be sent to destroy the threat.
Moderate
A relatively trivial threat level, Threat Level "Moderate" indicates that the threat's serious. It still indicates that
Aria Flower
needs to be sent to destroy the threat, however it also indicates that the threat must be taken seriously by
Aria Flower
.
Severe
A typical threat level, Threat Level "Severe" indicates that the threat's really serious. It now indicates that
Melinda Ice
must be sent to destroy the threat.
SERIOUS
A relatively serious threat level, Threat Level "SERIOUS" indicates that the threat's super serious. Not only that it indicates that
Melinda Ice
must be sent to destroy the threat, but the threat has to be taken very seriously and must be focused on.
DAMAGING
A serious threat level, Threat Level "DAMAGING" indicates that the threat's extremely serious. It requires help from The
Arcanum
Tribe to find a solution, and
Melinda Ice
now has to seriously focus on the threat.
INSANE!
A very serious threat level, Threat Level "INSANE!" indicates that the threat's destructive and barely penetrable. Not only that it requires help from The
Arcanum
Tribe and
Melinda Ice
, but the seriousness of the threat means that it needs another competent faction to join the
cosmicialverse
.
EXTREME!!
An extremely serious threat level, Threat Level "EXTREME!!" indicates that the threat's nigh unstoppable. It now requires a new competent faction to join the
cosmicialverse
and one new
cosmicialverse
god. Such recruits have to stop the threat as soon as they can with maximum seriousness.
MAXIMUM!!!
The most serious threat level of all, Threat Level "MAXIMUM!!!" indicates that the threat's unstoppable or even beyond unstoppable. There can only be one question: "Will they defeat the threat?"
A game maker used to produce games that are at the prison. This game maker is relatively easy to use, yet is able to make advanced games.
A storage used to literally put things to the tablets, which is a functionality that has been proved useful for replacing backpacks, as they do not require immense weight to carry a lot.
Who are the cosmicialverse gods?
[
]
Kyle Rosse
Aria Flower
Melinda Ice
Jerry Lassa (KICKED OUT)
Kyle Rosse
is the scientist of the three gods. He is ({‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
&{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!})
{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
&{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!} times as intelligent as Jerry Lassa or Aria Flower (both are equally intelligent), knowing where to find materials and which material is the best one. He even created a lot of the materials that the three gods regularly use by himself. However, he does not like being active outside of his room. He is also the kindest of the three.
History
[
]
Early Life
[
]
Kyle Rosse
is the oldest of the three, as he was born 5,142 human days before Jerry Lassa was born (in 9,982 OYC). Like the others, he was born looking like a normal human, but unlike the others, he was not born a regular human and not in a normally habitable place. He had the ability to live without any supplies and to navigate through space, which for the others would have to be obtained much later. He is born in a safe place in the cosmos.
Kyle Rosse
, after 3 human years, quickly learned many things, such as how the cosmos works and what he can do in the cosmos. He, however, decided to stay in the cosmos library to find out more. All of the library books took years to read and to undersrand, but he decided to read most of them. At 9 human years, he became packed with knowledge and he later decided to begin as a verse creator at 13 human years (which by that time is already 9,983 OYC).
His life as a verse creator
[
]
During his 7-year job of creating verses,
Rosse
was known for creating the first of the following types of verses:
Vshtbsuuonsuyusbuimauinsybgdvhsbusjusyggsvgsjsuhsuhsyx (9,984 OYC)
In 9,990 OYC,
Rosse
stopped creating verses, and had asked for the end of his job as a verse creator and was switched to become the teacher of cosmos. The reason why is because he was running out of ideas and he decided to teach about cosmos, because it's easier, more interesting and less controversy-making.
His life as a cosmos teacher, and the end of the beginning
[
]
Rosse
taught several young cosmos learners, along with cosmic entities that are yet to be more powerful at this time. He is extremely efficient, teaching the kids very well without looking at the book, and even testing their knowledge marvelously. He has been awarded numerous awards, including one that are given to him for his exceedingly efficient teaching.
Rosse
quit his job in teaching in 9,997 OYC. He stopped because he has something important to do, which is actually saving the world with
Flower
and
Lassa
. That OYC,
Rosse
insisted that
Flower
and
Lassa
team up with him to protect the cosmos. The cosmos was chaotic with unending peace at that time. Bad cosmic entities were ruining other cosmic entities' lives, and the cosmos was near the end. When he watched
Flower
and
Lassa
's conversation,
Rosse
realized that him telling
Flower
to tell
Lassa
wasn't enough.
Rosse
showed up and told
Lassa
the exact same thing
Flower
said.
This ended up with
Flower
and
Lassa
quitting their old job without permission, with them getting a new job as two of the three gods, who have the intention of stopping dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities and to make life better for good cosmic entities, whether weak or strong.
Aria Flower
is a game developer who is also the defender of the cosmicialverse, and was the most popular and the powerhouse of the three gods until
Miranda Ice
came. She is ({‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
&{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!})
{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
&{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!} times as powerful as
Kyle Rosse
or
Jerry Lassa
(they're both equally powerful). She is active and aggresive despite being very appealing, and is considered a hero for many. She was one of the most loved and the most praised of the three gods and was even praised and considered a leader by
Kyle Rosse
.
History
[
]
Early Life
[
]
Aria Flower
was created by two gods, Jordan Flower and Melissa O'Reille, in 9,983
OYC
as a normal human. When she was 11 human years old, she wanted to become a cosmic explorer, but the gods rejected her, because "they want her to live a normal, risk-free life". When
Aria Flower
was 15 human years old, she escaped from the
heaverse
using a rocket that her (now-dead) first friend, named Janus Sierra, built. It had the ability to generate everything a human being needs to survive. Despite high difficulties and risks, she managed to escaped from the
heaverse
with extra stuff in case something goes wrong for her.
After her escape from the
heaverse
, the first logical thing to do for
Aria Flower
is to do what she always wanted to do, exploring everything that was in the cosmos. Her first friend after escaping the cosmos was
Jerry Lassa
, who quickly became best friends with her until he was found out not worthy of being one of the three gods. The duo then explored the cosmos together until they found their early job as guardians of the
Straverse
.
Job as a guardian of the Straverse
[
]
Both
Flower
and
Lassa
applied for, and were granted the job as guardians of the
Straverse
. As one of the guardians of
Straverse
,
Aria Flower
was tasked to guard a large planet called Altes, a very interesting planet where people could build anything technological (as long as it's family friendly and not questionable), whether it's something useful, interesting or funny. She was regarded the seventh best guardian of the
Straverse
before she left the job for her "special job" as the hero of the cosmos.
Ten human days after her first day of guarding Altes,
Aria Flower
found the first army of invaders, with the leader named AMSR-003. Unfortunately for the invaders, they underestimated the power of the guardian of Altes. The guardian herself took care of the army with no problem.
Aria Flower
had also defended Altes from a total of 1,622,471 armies of invaders. The most powerless army was a group of four evil cosmic entities with the leader MIDS-661, while the most powerful army was with countless powerful cosmic entities with the leader IRCX-9427. She failed defending seven times.
In 9,997 OYC,
Aria Flower
found another friend called
Kyle Rosse
, who insisted that she and
Lassa
team up with him to protect the cosmos. The outside cosmos had been bad at that time. Powerful cosmic monsters were invading the cosmos. After hearing the terrible, unignorable news,
Aria Flower
later ran to
Jerry Lassa
and told him the story. Unfortunately,
Lassa
didn't believe
Flower
until
Rosse
showed up and said the exact same thing
Flower
told
Lassa
. This ended up with
Flower
and
Lassa
quitting their old job without permission, with them getting a new job as two of the three gods, who have the intention of stopping dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities and to make life better for good cosmic entities, whether weak or strong.
Melinda Ice
is the most popular and the powerhouse of the
cosmicialverse
gods. She has the combined-exponentiated overall attributes of all the cosmicians army plus all of the other
cosmicialverse
gods such that a layer-({‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
&{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!})
{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
&{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!} cosmician is generated every planck time, that every cosmician takes 1+10
-{‚àû, ‚àû, ‚àû, ‚àû}
times longer than the previous cosmician to generate and that the abilities of the cosmicians are the same. This makes her one of the most powerful cosmic entities in the cosmos, even beating
Big Cactus
of the
crustacianverse
. Much like
Aria Flower
, she is active and aggressive. Unlike
Flower
,
Ice
is a tomboyish girl.
History
[
]
Life on the Pocket Dimension
[
]
Melinda Ice
was created by Locke King (yes, the same person who accidentally released Eugenie) in 10,138 OYC. Unlike many of the cosmic entities, she lived in her pocket dimension for 135 human years with limited power to test her reliability. Because he's afraid that '
Melinda Ice
would destroy the world instead of saving it, Locke King trapped her in her home dimension (which is identical to a regular omniverse). The pocket dimension looks very similar to an omniverse, with the only difference being the fact that all cosmic things living in the pocket dimension are non-existent to outside of the world.
The pocket dimension simulates all of the cosmic entities, including many of the cosmic entities that are living outside of the world. In fact - this pocket dimension is simulating an entire omniverse. All
Ice
needs to do is to save the pocket dimension by defeating bad cosmic entities and saving the good ones in the pocket dimension, which are generated by the pocket dimension itself. She has unlimited powers that cannot be used outside of the pocket dimension until her first death.
Ice
did not do well at first, but she puts many of the things she wanted to do into practice. 135 human years after she was created, she died due to the creator's will.
Early Life
[
]
The first death of
Ice
caused the pocket dimension to destroy itself. After her first death,
Melinda Ice
was revived by Locke King, who was impressed by her attitude during her time in the pocket dimension. King tells
Ice
to put her attitude in the pocket dimension into practice in the real world. He then tells her to not to worry, because her life in the cosmos will be more fun than her life in the pocket dimension.
Before joining the
cosmicialverse
gods,
Melinda Ice
helped countless people cosmoswide and showed her heroism and power to help all those people. In other words, she put what she learned in her pocket dimension into practice. She worked as an independent hero until 10,245 OYC, when she removed all of Eugenie's corruption in the
cosmicialverse
and joined the
cosmicialverse
gods as a new main hero.
Jerry Lassa
was the least popular and the defender of the three gods. He was the most useless of the three, only defending the
cosmicialverse
. Lazy and doing minimal work, he was the most hated of the three gods, being criticized because he only wanted to take the job to protect himself. He was even hated by the two other gods and, for a very long time, is subject to being banned from the group and being demoted to a normal cosmic entity. Eventually, he got kicked out of the
cosmicialverse
, being stripped of all the powers he had during his job as a cosmicialverse god.
History
[
]
Early Life
[
]
Jerry Lassa
was born (360 human days before Aria Flower was born) in a very large spaceship as a normal human, in 9,983 OYC. When he was 13 human years old, he wanted to explore the cosmos for himself, so he decided to break into the information room and try to find out what the cosmos was and the true meaning of life. Unfortunately, the people in the spaceship were not very nice, as he wouldn't want kids or even young teenagers to find out about the cosmos, claiming that it is "confidential information" (when actually it is general info). At 16 human years,
Lassa
was kicked out for "looking at confidential information" (or more specifically, learning the cosmos) and was thrown out of the spaceship.
After
Jerry Lassa
became kicked out, he was lucky to be found by
Aria Flower
with a rocket that had the ability to generate everything a human being needs to survive, and they both explored the cosmos together. Both of them became best friends (until
Flower
found out
Lassa
was not worthy of being one of the three gods). They were exploring the cosmos until they found their job as guardians of the
Straverse
.
Job as a guardian of the
Straverse
[
]
Both
Flower
and
Lassa
applied for, and were granted the job as guardians of the Straverse. As one of the guardians of
Straverse
,
Lassa
was tasked to guard a large planet called Unitolo, a powerful planet that teaches the power of unlimited magic and how to use it properly. He was regarded as the third (second until the second chapter) best guardian of the
Straverse
before he left the job for her "special job" as the hero of the cosmos.
Two human days after his first day of guarding Unitolo,
Jerry Lassa
found the first army of invaders, with a strong leader named JSD-821. This army of invaders has countless soldiers and is filled to the brim with very strong soldiers, and none of the soldiers are weak. Luckily,
Jerry Lassa
fended them off despite being the beginner and had won the battle. Because of this, Jerry Lassa had been considered a very good hero of Unitolo.
Jerry Lassa
had also defended Unitolo from a total of 1,220,472 armies of invaders. The most powerless army was a group of millions of somewhat powerful cosmic entities with the leader IRMA-772, while the most powerful army was with countless monstrously powerful cosmic entities with the leader ILX-217. He failed defending twice.
In 9,997 OYC,
Aria Flower
, who had been insisted by
Kyle Rosse
to team up
Lassa
and
Rosse
to protect the cosmos, told him what
Rosse
insisted. Unfortunately,
Lassa
didn't believe
Flower
until
Rosse
showed up and said the exact same thing
Flower
told
Lassa
. This ended up with
Flower
and
Lassa
quitting their old job without permission, with them getting a new job as two of the three gods, who have the intention of stopping dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities and to make life better for good cosmic entities, whether weak or strong.
The Arcanum Tribe
[
]
The
Arcanum
Tribe is a group of powerful cosmic entities that are extremely skilled at creating extremely useful stuff. They are a group of inventors who builds half of everything for the
cosmicialverse
gods, as well as half of everything for people in the cosmos. It was founded in early 1975 OYC, making it one of the oldest things that are a major part of this verse.
As an individual entity, the
arcanums
are overwhelmingly powerful, even more powerful than
BEAN MAN BUT AWESOME
. As a part of
cosmicialverse
, however, they're even more powerful, surpassing even the base gods' overall power. They are one of the richest men in the cosmos, with an average
arcanum
having a revenue of $48.10 quintillion dollars in their first year.

Our first product is a food generator. You know, the one that generates foods. But anyway, this is a product that all making companies can make. The basic rule is: If your company cannot make a food generator, then your company will not be successful. We chose a cheeseburger because we love burgers. The product is a great success, so I guess our tribe is qualified.
‚Äù
‚Äî Joey Klindel, explaining the Food Generator
The first product and the only test product of The
Arcanum
Tribe, the food generator is a generator that makes cheeseburgers, because the
arcanums
love burgers. It can be turned on and off at the user's will. The product was a great critical and commercial success.
The first serious product of The
Arcanum
Tribe, the Versegone is a deleter that deletes verses with no barrier or barriers that are weaker than a nigh boundless cosmic entity. To do this, all you have to do is to get inside the verse, push the button in this product, and give yourself three seconds to escape the verse. Once you activate it, the verse will delete itself and its contents by shrinking itself and disintegrating all its contents when they touch the edge of the verse.
It was a great critical and commercial success, and countless copies of it are sold. As it had no expiration date, many cosmic entities still use it today to delete glitchy verses.
The second serious product of The
Arcanum
Tribe, the Versevive is a reviver that revives verses deleted by the Versegone. To do this, all you have to do is to find the center location of the verse that was deleted, push the button in the product, and move away as the verse revives itself. Once you activate it, it does the reverse of how the Versegone deletes the verse: The verse will revive itself and its contents by expanding itself and reintegrating all its contents when the verse reaches the location where they are reintegrated.
Like the Versegone, it was a great critical and commercial success. However, the Versevive sold much more copies than the Versegone. As it had no expiration date like the Versegone, many cosmic entities still use it today to revive verses that they think had been wrongfully deleted.
Not to be confused with
Game Center
, a service by Apple that allows users to play and challenge friends when playing online multiplayer social gaming network games.
The third serious product of The
Arcanum
Tribe, the Game Centre is a game console that has the power to play every game. It comes with a bundle of gaming controllers used to play all the games, as well as all of the games themselves, which are available for download. The Game Centre holds up to 2020 yottabytes of data, or approximately 101 quadrillion modern games. It also has 284 zebibytes of RAM. It also has a safety feature that will not let many nigh boundless cosmic entities harm you while playing the game.
Unlike the Versevive and the Versegone, it was less critically acclaimed and has less copies sold. However, it still sold countless copies and was still critically acclaimed. It was still used to this day to play millions of critically acclaimed and best-selling games, along with reviewing games that reviewers are not able to review due to the game being outdated.
The fourth serious product of The
Arcanum
Tribe, the Arcanumverse is the
arcanums
' first take of making verses. The arcanumverses are a series of shellverses that lets you live in it like a home. To set it up, you simply need to open the box, put out a Arcanumverse Product Core and push the button in the core. Once you push the button, the core will disintegrate itself and the verse will create itself and will quickly grow bigger in size. Unlike Wondows, you cannot control what this verse is like.
It is more critically acclaimed than all of The
Arcanum
Tribe's previous products, though it sold less copies than the Versevive and the Versegone. It was discontinued with the introduction of Wondows.
Wondows is a long-lasting group of several absolutely verse families, all of which are developed by The
Arcanum
Tribe without collaboration. It is a verse that basically lets you create, modify, build and live in it in a simple way. To set it up, you simply need to open the box, put out a Wondows Product Core and push the button in the core. Once you push the button, the core will disintegrate itself and the verse will create itself and will quickly grow bigger in size.
As of its latest version, Wondows has been the most critically acclaimed and best-selling product in the history of The
Arcanum
Tribe, and possibly one of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling products of all existence ranks, of all the cosmos, of all time and of all everything.
Wondows has lots of versions. All of them have an end-of-life date.

MyVideo is a video sharing service made by The
Arcanum
Tribe in 1,992 OYC, which was first released on tablet operating systems, and then ported to personal computer operating systems and mobile operating systems 1 OYC later after protest from PC and mobile users. It is a video sharing service that lets you upload videos and share them to the internet. However, hate videos are not allowed. Tablet operating systems are the main platforms - PC users and mobile users are the secondary platforms.
MyVideo was a critical success, though users complained that it was too tablet-oriented. Unlike most The
Arcanum
Tribe products, they made no profit from this service.
The primordium delta zero is a long-lasting group of
cosmicialverse
-exclusive
primordium deltas
created by The
Arcanum
Tribe. Not only are they more powerful than
primordium delta
, they have some exclusive abilities that the original
primordium delta
. They have several versions, from weakest to most powerful:
Primordium Delta Zero: The primordium delta zero is the first version of the primordium delta zero. It allows the user to significantly centonatially increase the power of something without actually increasing the "general meaning" of that something's power, with other advantages of the original
primordium delta
. It's actually even more powerful than the original
primordium delta
, because you can easily make something much more powerful while not changing the "general meaning" of the power. Even better, it's not a glitchy particle at all, unlike the original
primordium delta
. This has its own machine, which makes countless copies of these particles at a speed that's much faster than an instant. This is exclusive to the
cosmicialverse
, and the machine and the particle itself is impossible to breach without
Miranda Ice
.
Ultra Primordium Delta Zero: The ultra primordium delta zero is the second version of the primordium delta zero. It is even more powerful than the primordium delta zero, significantly circulodariatially increasing the power of something while providing the benefits of the original primordium delta zero. The ultra primordium delta zero now has the ability to give a random extremely powerful ability to the user that will not add to the "general meaning". Additionally, it has its own machine, which makes the ultra primordium delta zero ({‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
&{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!})
{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
&{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!} times as much as the primordium delta zero machine making a primordium delta zero, at a speed that's ({‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
&{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!})
{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!}
&{‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!, ‚àû!} times faster than the primordium delta zero machine making a primordium delta zero. Like the primordium delta zero machine, this is exclusive to the
cosmicialverse
, and the machine and the particle itself is impossible to breach without
Miranda Ice
.
Super Primordium Delta Zero: The super primordium delta zero is the third version of the primordium delta zero. It is even more powerful than the ultra primordium delta zero, infinitely ((‚àû&‚àû)&(thing's power)) increasing the power of something while providing the benefits of the previous primordium delta zeroes. It is the first (and currently the only) one whose effects infinitely increase each planck time it was used. It has its own machine, which makes the super primordium delta zero ((‚àû!&‚àû!)
(‚àû!&‚àû!)
&(‚àû!&‚àû!))
((‚àû!&‚àû!)&(‚àû!&‚àû!))
&((‚àû!&‚àû!)
(‚àû!&‚àû!)
&(‚àû!&‚àû!)) times as much as the ultra primordium delta zero machine making a ultra primordium delta zero, at a speed that's ((‚àû!&‚àû!)
(‚àû!&‚àû!)
&(‚àû!&‚àû!))
((‚àû!&‚àû!)&(‚àû!&‚àû!))
&((‚àû!&‚àû!)
(‚àû!&‚àû!)
&(‚àû!&‚àû!)) times faster than the ultra primordium delta zero machine making a ultra primordium delta zero.
This particle is a whole new product. The more blueprint particles destroyed, the powerful all the
cosmicialverse
becomes. Even an entity destroying a blueprint particle will make the
cosmicialverse
members much stronger than before. This particle is used to power up the new ultra primordium delta zero, and later the even newer super primordium delta zero.
Cosmicialverse Ripoffs
[
]
There is actually only one
cosmicialverse
(It's obvious because it is a headquarters, not a verse intended to be habitable to other cosmic entities). All of the other
cosmicialverses
are
blatant ripoffs
and are either inferior, or just leading to a void which basically tries to destroy everything that it contains. (Ripoffs of other things that are in here will also be listed here)
Ripoffs of the verse itself
[
]
Base Trap
Cosmosverse
Cosmicalverse
Cosmiciseverse
Cosmicianverse
Cosmosiverse
Base traps are copies of
cosmicialverses
created by the
Aria Flower
and
Kyle Rosse
to trap invaders, because both gods were concerned about the invaders. They are either much easier to break, much less secure or both, although this comes with a cost: Once there's an opening, whether it's a hole or a gentle entrance, it will summon a powerful black hole that only one of the cosmicialverse gods at that time (and something faster if possible) could escape from.
The cosmosverse was a (now-defunct)
horrendously blatant ripoff
of the
cosmicialverse
created by a somewhat powerful entity called
Ze
. It had exactly the same structure, with the two only differences being that the materials used in this verse are much weaker (though still monstrously strong), and that Ze and the ones whom they are on good terms with can inhabit this verse. This verse was quickly destroyed by
Aria Flower
and
Kyle Rosse
after less than a human day of noticing the blatant ripoff, and
Ze
was sent to the prison of the
cosmicialverse
for 6 human years.
The cosmicalverse was a (now-defunct)
blatant ripoff
of the
cosmicialverse
created by The Triscium Group, a group that was created for this project. To describe it, it is basically a nearly perfect copy
cosmicialverse
that are made with weaker materials. The cosmicalverse's main purpose is to make a habitable version of the
cosmicialverse
in multiples. All of the cosmicalverses were quickly destroyed by
Aria Flower
and
Kyle Rosse
after more than 12 human hours of noticing the blatant ripoff, and members of The Triscium Tribe were sent to the prison of the
cosmicialverse
for 12 human years.
The cosmiciseverse was a (now-defunct)
low-quality ripoff
of the
cosmicialverse
created by a group of unknown entities. Unlike the
cosmicialverse
, the cosmiciseverse had nothing inside it, had only one doors which can be opened and is made out if a weak material that is similar to the one that the real
cosmicialverse
is made of. This verse was easily destroyed by
Aria Flower
and
Kyle Rosse
in seconds after less than 6 human hours of noticing the insulting ripoff, and the two gods were so insulted, the group of the unknown entities who made this was sent to the prison of the
cosmicialverse
for 438 human years.
The cosmicianverse was a (now-defunct)
horribly blatant ripoff
of the
cosmicialverse
created by Trinsco Stripes, a group that is known for making habitable copies of homes of other cosmic entities. It is a second failed attempt at reviving the habitable
cosmicialverse
project by The Triscium Tribe, this time with materials that are close to the one used in the real
cosmicialverse
. This verse was destroyed by
Aria Flower
and
Kyle Rosse
in 20 minutes after less than 3 human hours of noticing the blatant ripoff, and members of The Triscium Tribe were sent to the prison of the
cosmicialverse
for 48 human years.
The cosmosiverse was a (now-defunct)
ripoff
of the
cosmicialverse
created by Anonymous Superstar. This time, it looked even more similar to the
cosmosiverse
, having materials similar to the ones used in building the real
cosmicialverse
. This verse was destroyed by
Aria Flower
and
Kyle Rosse
in 20 minutes after less than 1.5 human hours of noticing the blatant ripoff, and Anonymous Superstar was sent to the prison of the
cosmicialverse
for 96 human years.
Ripoffs of The Arcanum Tribe
[
]
The Parodia Company
The Arcade Tribe
Since The Parodia Company was supposed to be a parody of The
Arcanum
Tribe, this shouldn't be considered a ripoff. This company is the creator of Dowswin, which is supposed to be a parody of Wondows. However, they took it to the next level by making a Wondows 5 product using
The Ripoff
, with the only thing different from the original Wondows is the end-of-life date and the name. After Dowswin 0, The Arcanum Tribe put an end to The Parodia Company for making ripoffs of Wondows.
The Arcade Tribe was a ripoff of The Arcanum Tribe. This company was basically a reenactment of the history of The Arcanum Tribe with ripoff products, including the test product, using
The Ripoff
. The only difference was the original name and a few other variables. After making lots of products, The Arcanum Tribe finally put an end to The Arcade Tribe for making a lot of ripoff products.

Cosmicians Army was the first article EpicAlexisMaxwell created. However, it is now dead, due to lack of information.
He also jokingly stated that another reason would be as respect to the three gods, as they don't get their own page while the Cosmicians Army did.
The only contributor of the article, apart from EpicAlexisMaxwell himself, was ICantEdit.
This article was the second article EpicAlexisMaxwell created, is the oldest EpicAlexisMaxwell article that survived and is the only remaining main article.
Ironically, EpicAlexisMaxwell, the one who created the most loved of the
cosmicialverse
gods, all of which are female, is actually a male.
After contribution 22, the article is long enough to be seen in Special:long pages without the need to scroll down on an 11-inch (third-generation) iPad Pro in a landscape view.
After contribution 40, the article is longer than
Bob
. EpicAlexisMaxwell celebrated this by creating the first version of the article and the merged page.
There were only five contributions before its demise: The first one creating the article, the second one adding "__NOEDITSECTION__", "__NOINDEX__" and "__NONEWSECTIONLINK__". the third adding the words marked in bold: "So, do not edit the article unless it's to fix the introuction part
, to make some changes to the article's settings, to move the article
or to add an article that is merged into Cosmicialverse.", the fourth (by Leftunknown) adding the "Verse" category and the fifth removing it.
Ironically, EpicAlexisMaxwell said
not
to remove it until the article is no longer bigger than the tenth non-EpicAlexisMaxwell article", but this was done by EpicAlexisMaxwell way before that happened.
After contribution 100, the article is ten times longer than it was at the time it was created. For reference, the article was 3,442 bytes long at the time it was created.
After contribution 141, the article surpasses
Class 14
, the second longest article.
After contribution 161, the article becomes the first article on All Dimensions Wiki to surpass 69,420 bytes.
After contribution 187, the article becomes the first article on All Dimensions Wiki to surpass 100,000 bytes. However, this is only because of the merge of this article and the "first version" article.
After contribution 203, the article becomes twice the size of
Class 14
, the second longest article.

Wondows is a direct parody of Microsoft Windows. Codenames or names are often parodied to have their vowels changed to the letter "o".
Wondows Oxpo is derived from Windows Expi (which has the same pronounciation as Windows XP).
Coincidentally, 1986 and Vosto have the same codename as their Windows counterparts (2000 and Vista, respectively), NT 5.0 and Longhorn (respectively). This is because there are no opposites of 5 if there's no zero for the former and no non-o vowels for the latter.
All the characters are sometimes referred to by last name.
The seventh paragraph in the fourth chapter (Powerful, Destructive Gang) in the cosmicialverse arc is the longest paragraph in this page. Previously, the fifth paragraph in the same chapter in the cosmicialverse arc held the award for being the longest paragraph.
A scrapped chapter named Expedition of Plutoraverse was originally going to be the fifth chapter:
Taking place in 11,015 OYC, the fifth chapter will include something completely new. Rather than destroying cosmic entities, Melinda Ice, now having the ability to control two bodies, has decided to start an expedition in the plutoraverse, a strange verse in the cosmos that has extremely rare materials and absurdly powerful cosmic entities. However, while Ice was gone, Aria Flower had to defend against powerful threats to the cosmicialverse, who appeared after Melinda Ice's death.
Realizing that her friends are in danger, Melinda Ice had to use her power to unleash one of her abilities that generated from the cosmicialverse: The ability to create and control multiple bodies that look like her own. Ice realizes that she has two missions at the same time: Completing the expedition in the plutoraverse and defending the cosmicialverse to make sure her friends are not dead. Can she complete these very difficult missions at the same time?

SPECIAL FEATURE: First version of this page and its iterations
[
]
The original page is moved to this section of this page due to the invention of double-tabbing. If you want to read the introduction, look at Article Trivia. The original page was used as an honor to the page itself and the mergers. However, that page was useless as a result of the invention of double-tabbing, and thus was replaced by this section, which also honors that page by showing the first version of it. Feel free to file a complaint if you don't like it, but I'm not going to undo the change.
In other words, this special feature is used to honor the first version of the pages that were merged, the Cosmicialverse pages from other wikis and the versions of the Cosmicialverse page. The last three pages are just copies of the fourth-to-last one, but bear with me - they're still important for honor!

The cosmicians are armies of really powerful entities. They are really, really powerful. Heck, so powerful that even beyond boundless gods won't be able to annihilate them. They are generated at a special generator at a really large verse that's yet to be known. They are created by three, powerful gods called Kyle Rosse, Jerry Lassa and Aria Flower. (They are yet to have their own pages. Please be patient...)
How do they work?
[

Depending on the layer number, it could be so weak that nigh boundless gods can defeat them, or so powerful that even the most powerful cosmic entity, such as
Robert
, would be annihilated fighting them in seconds. Its basic purpose is to destroy dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities.
Layer 1
Common Abilities
Higher-layer cosmicians
Layer 1 is the weakest cosmic entity classified as a cosmician. It is so weak, that nigh boundless gods can defeat them. However, it's still powerful enough to defeat some powerful cosmic entities, such as
Bean Man
. According to Kyle Rosse, it took a planck time to create these entities and send them to reality.
All of the abilities are common to every cosmician:
Transportation: Cosmicians can fly like a rocket without the need of an actual rocket and at layer 32 and beyond, they can even teleport.
Size change: Cosmicians can change from -(10^-100) meters to 10^-100 meters, though this will be 10 times wider every increasing layer.
Cosmician Ability Copy: This is perhaps one of the most iconic abilities of the cosmicians. They are able to copy the abilities of what cosmicians killed before they were killed, though the abilities' power may vary over cosmicians (they can be stronger or weaker).
Each cosmician (except layer 1 cosmicians) are ‚àû
(‚àû^^^^^‚àû)
&‚àû times bigger than the previous-layer cosmicians. They also have more powerful copied abilities and take 10 times longer than one of the previous-generation layer cosmicians to create. They also have an ability to summon (or more specifically, create) ‚àû

&‚àû previous-generation layer cosmicians that are ‚àû

The

is the headquarters of the
Cosmicians Army
, where they are generated and the home of the three powerful gods called
Kyle Rosse
,
Jerry Lassa
and
Aria Flower
. It's not known where they are created, as they keep moving from place to place, and in such a way that's unpredictable (though in a way that it cannot bump towards verses.) Its size is larger than an
omniverse
, but still smaller than
The Box

Description
[

General Structure
Despite being called a verse, it is more of a building that's larger than an omniverse. It is made out of walls that are made out of extremely unbreakable walls that only the aforementioned three gods (and more powerful gods, though this will never, ever happen) are able to break. The more powerful the three gods are, the more unbreakable the wall becomes. There are some windows that are just as unbreakable as the main material. The outside is also made out of outside walls that only has a few openings, automated by a highly-advanced electricity system.
Three Gods

Properties

All of them have the same properties:
They are gods, but they look and act like human beings. They look like humans who are the size and the voice of an adult and the look of a preteen. They are, however, very mature (with the exception of Jerry Lassa) when it comes to destroying dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities.
They are all considered the most powerful cosmic entities. Each of them have the combined-exponentiated powers of all the cosmicians generated.
They have one goal: To destroy dangerous and purely bad cosmic entities.

Jerry Lassa
is the least popular and the defender of the three gods. He is the most useless of the three, only defending the cosmicialverse. Lazy and doing minimal work, he was the most hated of the three gods, being criticized because he only wanted to take the job to protect himself. He's even hated by the two other gods and, for a very long time, is subject to being banned from the group and being demoted to a normal cosmic entity.
|-|Aria Flower =
Aria Flower
is the most popular and the powerhouse of the three gods. She is ten times as powerful as Kyle Rosse or Jerry Lassa (they're both equally powerful). She is active and aggresive despite being very appealing, and is considered a hero for many. She is one of the most loved and the most praised of the three gods and is even praised and considered a leader by Kyle Rosse.

gods, and The

Tribe. They often move from place to place, and in such a way that's unpredictable (though in a way that it cannot bump towards verses.) The
cosmicialverse
is more of a sphere building that's absurdly massive. It is made out of walls that are made out of extremely unbreakable walls and in many parts glass that can only be broken by
Melinda Ice
. The outside is also made out of outside walls (made with the same material as the normal walls) that only has a few openings, automated by a top-of-the-line electricity system that gets much better every planck time. The
cosmicialverse
consists of mostly long and huge hallways, but also consists of many main parts of the building, all of which are extremely easy for the
cosmicialverse
gods, the cosmicians army and the
arcanums
to navigate to, but extremely difficult for most of the other cosmic entities to navigate to.
There is actually only one
cosmicialverse
(It's obvious because it is a headquarters, not a verse intended to be habitable to other cosmic entities). All of the other
cosmicialverses
are blatant ripoffs and are either inferior, or just leading to a void which basically tries to destroy everything that it contains. So far, there are six ripoffs of the cosmicialverse itself and two ripoffs of The Arcanum Tribe.
There are some inhabitants in the

The cosmicians: The cosmicians are armies of entities that are so powerful that even beyond boundless gods won't be able to annihilate them. They are generated at a special generator at the Cosmicialverse. Depending on the layer number, the cosmician could be so weak that even some of the second everything layer gods can defeat them, or so powerful that even many of the so-called end-all-be-all entities would be annihilated fighting them in seconds.
This verse also has three
cosmicialverse
gods,
Melinda Ice
,
Aria Flower
and
Kyle Rosse
. All of them are omnipotent and are using the tablet RedIO-‚àû74, a powerful tablet capable of doing something a server computer can't do.
Finally, there is The
Arcanum
Tribe, which is a group of powerful inventors that are extremely skilled at creating extremely useful stuff, and are building half of everything for the
cosmicialverse
gods, as well as half of everything for people in the
All Dimensions Wiki

The
cosmicialverse
is the home of the Cosmicians Army, three all-powerful
cosmicialverse
gods, and The
Arcanum
Tribe. They often move from place to place, and in such a way that's unpredictable (though in a way that it cannot bump towards verses.) The
cosmicialverse
is more of a sphere building that's absurdly massive. It is made out of walls that are made out of extremely unbreakable walls and in many parts glass that can only be broken by
Melinda Ice
. The outside is also made out of outside walls (made with the same material as the normal walls) that only has a few openings, automated by a top-of-the-line electricity system that gets much better every planck time. The
cosmicialverse
consists of mostly long and huge hallways, but also consists of many main parts of the building, all of which are extremely easy for the
cosmicialverse
gods, the cosmicians army and the
arcanums
to navigate to, but extremely difficult for most of the other cosmic entities to navigate to.
There is actually only one
cosmicialverse
(It's obvious because it is a headquarters, not a verse intended to be habitable to other cosmic entities). All of the other
cosmicialverses
are blatant ripoffs and are either inferior, or just leading to a void which basically tries to destroy everything that it contains. So far, there are six ripoffs of the cosmicialverse itself and two ripoffs of The Arcanum Tribe.
There are some inhabitants in the
cosmicialverse
:
The cosmicians: The cosmicians are armies of entities that are so powerful that even beyond boundless gods won't be able to annihilate them. They are generated at a special generator at the Cosmicialverse. Depending on the layer number, the cosmician could be so weak that even some of the second everything layer gods can defeat them, or so powerful that even many of the so-called end-all-be-all entities would be annihilated fighting them in seconds.
This verse also has three
cosmicialverse
gods,
Melinda Ice
,
Aria Flower
and
Kyle Rosse
. All of them are omnipotent and are using the tablet RedIO-‚àû74, a powerful tablet capable of doing something a server computer can't do.
Finally, there is The
Arcanum
Tribe, which is a group of powerful inventors that are extremely skilled at creating extremely useful stuff, and are building half of everything for the
cosmicialverse
gods, as well as half of everything for people in the
All Dimensions Wiki
cosmos. They are even more powerful, surpassing even the base gods' overall power, and are one of the richest men in the cosmos, with an average
arcanum
having a revenue of $48.10 quintillion dollars in their first year.
