Negative One
(-1 or
Alpholk Ba
in the
Pencil Language
) is a negative
planet
verse inside an another planet,
Zero
. It has it's moon, -1A. It has lost of voids (97%, give or take away an infinitesimal value) but somehow life exists here. They don't dominate -1 very much so the planet looks really natural.  It's colder than absolute zero and it's always getting colder and colder as time passes by. It also has so many losses of life (6.8×10
123
of them in total during its lifetime) that life will never ever exist long after. It has persisted for 2.3×10
38
years and had several mass impacts on it. They would had killed a large percentage of species living there. This is mainly because the planet isn't that resilient while the life forms' advancents take place. Most of these impacts are just earthquakes of this planet. It has just too many cracks and faults that nonillions of them break out every year. Even the moon -1 has is the same, with only less worse situations. Some others are casued by misaligned places.
Somehow, it contains -1
Negative Twos
, but this doesn't mean it neither exists nor within -1, it'll only make -2s into
negaexistence
. Those 2 planets is negaexistent to -1, however it actually exists. All of its properties won't change, though. Also, there is none of this kind of planet in a
Zero
but this is even weirder. The planet itself is a noenxistent object wandering across the planet zero but to its perspective, it exists. So, this makes that every negative Numberverse in the Number Chain is something like this, which makes that Zero bridges the gap between the positive and negative worlds.
This planet isn't really a planet but a
netplan
(which would be considered a planet normally).
