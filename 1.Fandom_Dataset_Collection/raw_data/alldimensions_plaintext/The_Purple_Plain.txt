About
[
]
A
Purple Plain
is the seventh type of
verse
in the
Color Plain
chain
, and the second largest of it.
Properties
[
]
Instead of containing a lot of plants and/or water like all of the other Plain types, Purple Plains contain tons of lava. Weirdly, said
substance
is purple in them, and is a lot hotter than any lava on
Earth
.
This is why this type of Plain is by far both the most dangerous and warmest one in its
Le Jorino areas
. Their temperature is even higher than the one of
Red Plains
. Obviously, they thus don't contain life with these conditions with frequence, besides the
lifeforms
found within the much safer and protected
Blue Plains
.
