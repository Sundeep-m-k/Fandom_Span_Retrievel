The
Tranverse
is a verse that contains many different types of machines and transportation technologies. It also contains a bunch of H letters, which alter the machines and transportation. The machines are all powered by the Tran. There are a lot of civilizations in the Tranverse, but most of them make machines as their way of life and some of them remain relatively isolated.

History of the Tranversean Civilization
Tran
[
]
The Tran.
The Tran was the first section of this verse to be formed. It is around 1428 km in diameter. It was formed due to millions of element-clusters being near one another at the same time. These particles have a threshold that causes them to vibrate unstably, so if there are too many other particles around them, they vibrate. When millions of them happened to be near each other, they all vibrated and this caused them to touch each other, because of the vibrations making them slightly move. They all merged together, over the process of a few weeks, and they turned into the Tran.
Eventually, after the Tran was fully created, the Tran created its own force, which pulls everything towards it. However, it pulls everything at a constant velocity with no acceleration, meaning it is not gravity. This represents only the first derivative of position.
The Tran is now stored in the middle of the Tranverse, and it acts as a power source for all of the machines in the Tranverse. This is because the Tranverse is always stored in the Brown Soup.
The Brown Soup
[
]
The Brown Soup is a collection of liquids and solids that resides in the Tran's area. The materials in The Brown Soup, when colliding with the particles in the Tran, create waves that conveniently reach 1,666,667 ly in every direction. If a machine is in range of this (and this includes everything in the Tranverse), the waves can send signals to specific objects and convert them into motion. This powers most of the machines in the Tranverse. However, every time this happens, some of the Brown Soup disappears, so new soup has to be added periodically. This is added via the Brown Soup Dumper.
Brown Soup Dumper
[
]
The Brown Soup Dumper is a system of tubes that lead from some places in the six sections to the middle of the core, where the Tran is. There are 18 tubes, or 3 in each section. Any time, Brown Soup can be placed into one of the tubes and sent to the core where the rest of the Brown Soup is. The tubes are each 1,666,504ly long, but Brown Soup, when in motion, accelerates fast and never stops accelerating, so it only takes a couple of months for the Brown Soup to get down to the core.
The tubes were built by a couple of Tranverse residents in the committee, who noticed that the Brown Soup was slowly disappearing, and they spent some resources to create the tubes. Luckily the tubes are very thin, and the material in between the sections and the core is decently soft, so it was not difficult to create the eighteen tubes required for the Brown Soup Dumper to work.
Momentum property
[
]
The Tran's force, since it isn't gravity, has a special property. If an object is being affected by the Tran's force, it has no limit to horizontal momentum. This means there is effectively no speed limit in the Tranverse, making transportation technologies extremely efficient.
Structure
[
]
The Tranverse is made out of six sections, which are all different colours. The verse resembles the Gear Ball, a puzzle invented by Oskar van Deventer and sold by Meffert's.
Out Liner
[
]
The six sections are surrounded by a black outline called the Out Liner, which is solid. It is made of some particles that got shoved together after a force was created in the Tran. The Out Liner is not used for much, but it acts as a separator between the different sections. Inside the Out Liner is a type of black stone that cannot be broken without special tools, so many of the sections remain isolated from one another. There are several pathways that connect them, but they are usually not used by the beings inside of the Tranverse.
Core
[
]
The Core is in the middle of the Tranverse (shocking!) and it contains the Tran and the Brown Soup. The majority of the core is filled with the Brown Soup, and the other sections have absolutely nothing. The main point of the core's existence is to hold the Tran, which allows all the machines to be powered.
The core was created as a result of the fact that, despite the Tran's inward pull, anything other than Brown Soup that is too close to the Tran is deleted. Therefore, the material that makes up most of the Tranverse is not inside the core, since it would be deleted otherwise. This is also why nobody goes to the core, since they would get deleted by the particles in the Tran.
The stuff between the core and the sections
[
]
This is a layer between the core and the outer sections that is mostly just solid stone, but it is quite soft, so it was easy to create the Brown Soup Dumper tubes. Other than those tubes, most of this layer is just rock, but there are occasionally some yellow stones in the middle of the grey ones, which are softer. This material is often very difficult to get the material out of the layer, but it is possible. There have been several designed machines and mechanisms of methods to get the yellow stones.
Etymology
[
]
The name of this layer is disputed. Some prefer to call it "Hongular Space" in honour of Jron Hongular, but other people really hate Jron Hongular because he made a controversial decision one time. Therefore, it is also sometimes called the "Nezn√°my". A third name was brought up by somebody, and it gained a large following, but it has never been the official listing on encyclopedias and academic papers.
Outside
[
]
Since the Tranverse's radius is only 1,666,666.5 ly and the Tran can pull from up to 1,666,667 ly, there is a 0.5 ly region around the Tranverse that is not part of the Tranverse, but is still subject to the Tran's pulling force. This section has absolutely nothing in it, because they all fall down to the sections or the Out Liner.
The outside is often used as a testing ground for transportation devices by air, because it is still subject to the Tran's force but it does not have any potential obstructions from other things the civilians use, since there are only ever a few things in the Outside at any time.
Sections
[
]
There are six sections in the Tranverse. They are the purple, yellow, blue, green, red and orange sections. Each one has a bunch of people that create machines powered by the Tran in the core, but the sections remain mostly isolated from each other. Also, many of them are sparsely populated due to their large size.
Purple section
[
]
The purple section contains many civilizations that mostly focus on building mechanical machines that only use geometry to work, rather than electricity or power. Therefore, it is the section that uses the Tran's waves the least, out of any of the sections. Its civilizations are more homogeneous than most of the other sections.
It was originally inhabited by worms, which were unintelligent, until some beings from the neighbouring red section came over via a hole through the Out Liner and started some civilizations there. There are still some worms in this section, but they are less common.
There were a couple waves of influxes from the red section and one from the blue section, but after that, this section has remained relatively isolated from most of the other sections. Since they are isolated, they do not gain inspiration and mostly create simpler, mechanical machines. However, many of the machines are still good and innovative.
Currently, the purple section is working on machines for simple quality-of-life purposes, but it is expected for them to attempt to reach other sections in the near future to reduce isolation.
The purple section is divided into regions which all have short and simple names.
Yellow section
[
]
The yellow section contains a different set of civilizations that originally started in Endypuz, and it remained there until major advancements in transportation technologies that were able to reach other uninhabited regions more reliably.
This section primarily focuses on the creation of transportation devices of all kinds, such as trains and human carriers. However, the section also creates other things, such as storage services and tax managers. Most of these machines are only used within their region, but they occasionally get sent to other regions and sometimes even other sections.
This section's civilization originated as a result of too many particles being together, and the civilization eventually went out of control. One person, called Ivka Meister, decided to keep the section in better control by forming a leadership that regulates the civilians. This has continued, and it still remains the only section that has an official leadership government that regulates the machines and bans certain aspects.
There have been many attempts to overthrow and abolish this government because the civilians want more freedom of choice in their machinery. A recent conducted survey showed that 87.8% of beings in the yellow section do not support the leadership and would prefer to be free.
The yellow section is divided into regions which are usually named after their largest civilization.
Blue section
[
]
The blue section is the least populous section, but it is the most diverse. In the blue section, machines of all types are being created, and creativity and trying new things is always encouraged. Therefore, most civilians create a bunch of different fields of machines.
Due to this diversity, however, it is uncommon for somebody in the blue section to excel at any one field, because all of the effort is spread across many different diverse practices and mediums. This may mean the machines could be less innovative than some of the other sections, but the communities in the blue section would prefer diversity over innovation.
The blue section used to have a government just like the yellow section, but the government was overthrown by the communities with help from the orange section because the government decided to start discouraging diversity. Now, it remains a place with a large range of machinery and transportation technologies with more being made all of the time.
The blue section is divided into the regions which were the highest voted region borders out of several options in a poll.
Green section
[
]
The green section is the section with the largest population and it was the first inhabited section in the Tranverse. There is a huge amount of civilizations in this section, and they create a large amount of machines. Due to the huge population, the green section creates the most machines out of any section, but it does not have the highest rate of machines made per civilian.
The green section's residents create machines of all kinds and all purposes, but there is less of an emphasis on diversity than the blue section, so some civilizations remain homogeneous. However, innovations in transportation, Tranverse physics and quality-of-life improvements happen here very frequently. Most of the measured indexes in machine development rank near the Tranversal median in the green section.
It was where Jron Hongular first lived, and Jron Hongular was a very influential, but controversial figure in the Tranverse's history. Many of the decisions that Hongular made were well-received by some civilians and disliked by others, such as attempting communication to the other sections and changing machine policies. This is the origin of the naming dispute behind the area in between the sections and the core.
The green section is divided into a very large amount of regions because the regions have similar populations to regions in other sections and the green section is very populated, so the regions need to be small.
Red section
[
]
The red section is currently the section in the messiest state. There is a high rate of violence and machines are stolen a lot of the time. It is the only section with a high rate of violence. However, there is a large amount of innovation in the machines because there is an encouragement to choose a single field of expertise and practice it.
Some of the machines created include aircraft, methods to explore trans-Tranversean objects, and other methods that are meant to be progressive to society. This is a result of civilians wanting to excel in only a single field, so one that progresses society and technology is a common choice, since it is very useful.
The section is messed up because one time, a person called Rayac Jimwicud tried to divide the section into different groups and gave different privileges to each one. This was supported by the largest and most privileged groups, but not the other people. However, due to greed, there was a majority vote for it to happen, so it happened, and now the section is divided.
This has continued despite a lot of domestic travel, so the groups are all evenly spread out through the section, but the violence has remained in the section. Some people like Rayac Jimwicud and some people do not. Most civilians outside of the Red Section have strongly opposed the behaviour in the red section, and the red section is very notorious for being a bad place to live.
Since violence and discrimination rate is high, the region divisions are messily arranged, with many different trapped areas and strange-sized areas.
Orange section
[
]
The orange section has a set of civilizations that are more social than the other sections and they often like to collaborate on machines more than the other sections. This means many of the machines in the orange section are large ones that take a long time, with many functions. This is a result of collaboration.
Many of the machines created here are large and elaborate, which creates a larger influx of innovation but also decreases the frequency and quantity of gadgets. Also, transportation technological development is uncommon here because it is rare for a transportation method to be created in the orange section.
Once in a while, an organization forms to try to have a large amount of people in the orange section to come together and work on a single factory. Factories are very rare in the other sections, so the orange section excels the most in the factory field. These factories have machines in them so they can make a lot of products real fast.
The orange section was the final section to be inhabited. It was first inhabited by visitors from the green section. A few passages were made through the Out Liner and some civilians from the green section came in. The visiting was originally done as an experiment, but around 55% of the civilians involved with the experiment liked the orange section and stayed there. Its population has been growing the fastest out of any of the sections because it has the lowest rate of violence out of any of them.
This section is divided into six regions which were decided randomly. Some of the borders split communities in half, but the civilization usually does not mind.
Divisions
[
]
Every section in the Tranverse was officially divided into multiple regions, each with their own name. These divisions were decided by a committee in the blue section. The divisions were meant to keep the relative populations, creative works and taxes constant throughout all of the sections, and all of the regions contained a similar amount of machines. The committee thought this was going to make the sections more manageable since the sections on their own are 3,333,333 square light years and these regions are smaller, but in reality, it did not change much, since the regions are still extremely huge. However, the regions are still official due to the machines in each section being in a decently similar category, and due to a desire to categorize things into arbitrary subdivisions.
The divisions of the red section are a complete mess of arrangements. This is because the intentions of many of the civilians were different in other areas, and some areas were much more densely populated than other areas. The region of Truncu ended up being completely surrounded when the regions were decided, which has been inconvenient for the Truncu residents for many decades.
Languages
[
]
The green, blue, red and yellow sections each have their own language, while the purple section uses the red and blue section languages and the orange section uses the green section language. They are all fairly simple to learn and they have recently all collectively agreed to adapt to the same written script, since they were all easily adaptable.
Around 16% of Tranverse civilizations are monolingual. 50% of them are bilingual (usually speaking their own language and the green section language), 26% of them are trilingual, while 8% of them can understand and speak all four of the Tranverse's languages.

The Mechanical Base Converter
The Mechanical Base Converter is a machine that can convert any number in any base to any other. It does this by using falling balls and axels on the back of it, which need to be reset every use. It was a very difficult machine to make because of its intricacy, but the newest version can currently convert the base of any number from 0 to 1048576 (in base 10, or 2^20). Several different versions of this machine have been created that can convert numbers into other methods of representing them.

Walking machine
This is a machine that creates a movement that looks like walking if a knob is turned. It is possible to put legs in this machine and use it to walk, because the movements have very high torque. Similarly to many other machines in the purple section, this device is purely mechanical and does not use any power.

Unnamed transportation device
The unnamed transportation device was the first transportation device to be created in the Jirosop region. It moves quickly by ejecting mass out the other side and absorbing it again. It has mass ejectors in any direction so it can move in any direction quite feasably. This design was inspired by the movement of the H letters that float around the Tranverse, and the creator of this machine studied them and was able to use similar concepts and mechanisms to create this machine.

Device-36WNA2
This object was designed to be a simpler method to transport objects smaller than a breadbox. It is a set of two wireless objects. One of the boxes can locate the other one, and then find a path that allows an object to get from one to the other very quickly. It needs to find a path that it can launch the object while also not hitting anything in the process. This machine required a lot of tweaking and testing to make sure it was reliable, and the current version is considered reliable.

Device-71PXL9
This service is a method of air transport designed to transport civilians from one section to another whenever it is required. There is an equidistant two-dimensional projection of the Tranverse and the traveller must choose the desired destination. Then, a compartment is chucked into the air, to bring the civilians to the desired destination. Since there is usually nothing in the way and the destination does not need to be perfectly accurate, this device did not require as much testing as Device-36WNA2. The compartment can be used three times before it runs out of power.

The machine machine
The machine machine is a machine that can convert many inputs from other machines into one output. It can be configured very extensively down to many different settings, so any logic system can be created from it. It is not very useful on its own, but it is a very popular element in other machines, even outside the blue section, being listed in supply shops. For example, it has been used in Device-71PXL9 and in Argso Nav's original machine.

Civilian door detector
This machine is placed on a door or safe and it can be used to lock a door or safe, but it opens if the owner puts a body part on it, and then it opens. It only detects the owner's body because it stores their exact particle placement and remembers it. It can also only be configured when opened, so other civilians don't configure it while it is closed. This is used to make it simple for civilians to open doors and safes while retaining privacy.

Drill that can be used to get yellow stones from Hongular Space
This tool is a very old tool and it is a detector that can be used on the surface and it displays where the nearest yellow stone is. After the civilian using the tool moves to the location shown, they can turn on the drill and it will move very fast down to the yellow stone. Then, another machine can be used to bring it up. This the most widely used machine tool to get yellow stones, but there are many others that have been made and are considered reliable.

Torch that can be used to remove some matter
This torch can be turned on or off and it uses a substance that can vastly decrease the boiling point of things that it collides with, causing it to become a gas. This allows the civilian to essentially remove matter, but it doesn't work on other civilians, which is good, because that would be dangerous. The substance is highly compressed, so it can remove material quite fast, but the product is considered very dangerous and it usually not sent out to the public.

Plane that can be used slow descent to the ground
This machine is a plane object that can be used for all forms of transportation downwards. It has a method of taking particles from the air and pushing them downward, propelling the plane up and causing it to stay in the air due to it cancelling out the Tran's force. It can then be adjusted more or less, or pushed in a specific direction, to move the plane around. This could be a transportation device in all directions, but it would not be very useful for transportation due to slowness, so it is almost exclusively used as a method to go downwards.

Gear that can be used to change the gearing ratios of a gear chain
This is a tool that can be used in gear chains. A number only needs to be inputted in it, and then two gears can be attached to it, one on each end. The number inputted will be the gearing ratio for these two gears (so, for example, inputting 100 will make it so that turning the first gear 100 times will make the second gear turn one time). This is power programatically, so it is not mechanical and it can take any positive number as an input, including irrational numbers.

Recording machine
The recording machine is a machine that contains a very high-resolution recording device and a very stable setup, so it can be used to observe very small objects such as fundamental particles. It can also be slightly adjusted, moved, rotated, and zoomed, to give a full view of the position, but it moves in very small steps which are not visible to the naked eye. It is also possible to attach it to a controller, to create a way to observe the particles and move around like in a video game. The creator of this machine only excelled in this field so this was the only machine they ever made.

Since the creator of this machine only studied in the field of neural networks, and studied it extensively, they were able to create a neural network that learns from other neural networks and makes its own neural networks, which are usually very good. This design has been adapted to more general and useful tasks, but this one is considered a definite benchmark in neural network design.

The Cylindrical-Shaped Factory
This factory was meant to be a factory that uses a neural network to analyze any design and turn it into a manufactureable product, followed by manufacturing it. The design was based off a different design in the green section made by Argso Nav, which was a neural network that could create a three-dimensional render out of a few two-dimensional designs, and the Cylindrical-Shaped Factory was an extension of this design to work for any designs, including moving parts and power.

H letters
[
]
The Tranverse contains a lot of H letters that float around the sections. These H's are mostly made of translucent gas, and if they touch a machine, the machines get slightly altered.
A diagram of the formation of H's.
Origin
[
]
Every time the Tran touches the Brown Soup and the soup disappears, the Brown Soup gets converted into a gas substance that eventually moves away from the Tran and gets to the sections. Over time, this has happened many times and a lot of gas has gone into the sections. However, usually this gas is difficult to see. This is because the gas needs to be arranged into an H formation for the gas to be visible and alter machines.
Usually, it takes a lot of time for an H to form, because seven gas particles need to combine. However, it is very likely for H's to form, because gas particles stick together, and they typically get automatically pulled into an H pattern because it is the most natural one.
The H pattern
[
]
The particles tend to form into an H pattern because having two particles with 3 neighbours is the most stable configuration. When this happens, the H becomes more visible.
Particles with three neighbours (Middle particles)
[
]
The middle particles are used for stability, as the H is very unstable otherwise. The two particles with three neighbours are crucial, and the one in the middle acts like a "bridge" to connect the two and ensure that they still have three neighbours.
Particles with two neighbours (Bridge)
[
]
The particle in the middle acts as a bridge to ensure that the middle particles have three neighbours each but the edges have one each. Otherwise, the bridge does not serve a functional purpose as particles with two neighbours do not have any special properties.
Particles with one neighbour (Edges)
[
]
These particles are responsible for the movement of the H letter. They are typically quite random, but it is likely for only one of them to be active at any one time. They create a force that pushes the other particles in a direction; a force which is present only in particles with one neighbour. This is done by ejecting mass out the other direction and absorbing it afterwards, almost instantaneously.
Usage
[
]
Every time an H letter touches one of the machines in the Tranverse, the faces are pushed slightly back, such as holes becoming slightly bigger. This allows more tolerance, and makes many of the machines more reliable and optimized. Also, the parts are each given a slight repulsion, causing things to slide more easily. The H letters are mostly there to create optimization for the machines. However, if the designer of a machine does not want influence from the H's, they can place it into a room made of metal and it will not be vulnerable to H letters.
Flaws
[
]
Occasionally, the H might make an adjustment that is unwanted to the creator of the machine. This is unlikely, as the adjustments are very small, but if it ever happens, it might be difficult for them to fix. However, in most cases, this usually happens when a part is required to have high friction with another part and not slide easily, so if this situation happens, it is a good idea to add a method to increase the friction by using a different machine made by somebody else. This means it is a good idea to use other machines to make a machine, since they might be helpful in the process. Therefore, it is common for civilians to create machines that are designed to make other machines easier to create.
History of the Tranversean Civilization
[
]
The original civilization of the Tranverse was in the green section, which was a result of the natural process of particles forming together. The civilization started in what is now Genimed, and remained only in there for many decades, until an unnamed Tranversean wondered about what would be outside of the place they were in. Then, they realized the importance of creating a method of transportation to get there, so they created one. This is widely believed to be the first machine created in the Tranverse.
It was a great success, and the person was able to explore many different other places within the green section. Eventually, the person who made the machine communicated with the other Tranverseans and let them know about the findings and the importance of creating machines, so machines were eventually widespread throughout the civilizations of the green section. Many different other machines were created during this time and most of the green section had been explored due to fast methods of transportation and a lot of time.
Around this time, the process of particles forming together created the civilizations in the blue and red sections, which were originally very small and rudimentary in terms of technological advancements. They remained very isolated and rudimentary for many decades, and it would be a very long time before the civilians from the green section came over and showed them the importance of creating machines. This communication was done without words, since at this time, the green, blue, and red sections each had their own spoken language and could not communicate with one another.
A few years later, the yellow section had another civilization form, but the particle formations that happened were much more chaotic and for a long time, the yellow section's civilization was out of control. Ivka Meister, one of the civilians, decided to attempt to form a leadership government with the acceptance of a few civilians in their area, to regulate the civilians' actions. This was well-received at first, but as time progressed and technology advanced, the civilians of the yellow section started to oppose the government. Despite this, the blue section also set up a government shortly after the yellow section, but the leadership was opposed as soon as diversity became discouraged and the leadership was eventually abolished by its civilians.
After this, Jron Hongular, a person from the green section, realized that the purple section was uninhabited by civilians, so Jron encouraged several members of the red and blue sections to use their transportation devices to move to the purple section. Several of the civilians involved in this experiment liked the purple section, so they stayed there. Eventually, the purple section grew into a legitimate civilization. Due to its success. Jron decided to do it again, but this time with the orange section. However, a few mistakes were made which resulted in hundreds of civilians going missing, which is what makes Jron Hongular a very controversial civilian. However, the orange section did eventually get inhabited by civilians from the green section.
In the red section, Rayac Jimwicud then decided to split up the red section's civilizations into different groups and give different privileges to each one. This was a very controversial decision, as the privileged groups supported it but not the unprivileged groups. It is also unanimously disliked by the other sections, and several attempts have been made to fix it, but none have been successful. These divisions eventually turned into violence, which is still going on today.
With technology and machine development advancing rapidly, many committees were formed in the sections, which had purposes such as machine encouragements, surveys, technological advancement or regulations. Most of these committees were well-received by civilians of the sections and any committee that is controversial ends up falling apart and eventually ending. One committee is notable for having decided the official region borders for all of the sections.
Decently recently, the sections all agreed to adapt a writing system for their languages, like many other civilizations near them. It was widely accepted that the script should be the same for all of the languages, but it took a long time for a writing system to be universal. Eventually, one script created by a committee from the orange section was specifically designed to be able to accommodate every section's language and be easy to learn, and it resulted in 94% of civilians in the Tranverse to agree with it, which was considered significant enough to adapt the writing system as a universal script.
Today, the Tranverse's civilizations are currently in a state where technology is rapidly advancing and machines are a core part of the Tranverse's lifestyles.
