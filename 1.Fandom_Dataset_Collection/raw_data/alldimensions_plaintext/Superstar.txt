A
Superstar
is an extremely large star can can exist in
Our Multiverse
, They are very big, so big in fact, that every Superstar has to be at least 1,000,000,000 Light Years large. They also in it's entirety, looks like a Galaxy. In fact, the reason why it looks like it because it is not a galaxy, but that it has an energy output so unimaginably gargantuan, that all the energy is converted into a spiral-like shape that rotates around the Superstar. In fact, the one in the image is the 2nd Superstar discovered in Our Multiverse. The Superstar is a pixel in that image. In fact, it has so much energy that it breaks physics into the 4th Dimension. Seemingly warping
Rouge Galaxies
around it. In fact, it has so much energy, that if it exploded, it would create an UNIMAGINABLY Gargantuan Ultranova that can not only destroy The
Multiverse
, Not Even The
Metaverse
, But the
Xenoverse
! It would even effect the
Hyperverse
! They can only form when a
Quasi-Star
absorbs sso much matter, it eventually becomes a Superstar. They can also be in
Super Systems
. There are only 4 Superstars in Our Multiverse. Each with a Kardashev Scale of 1 or 1.5.
