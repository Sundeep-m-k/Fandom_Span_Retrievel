The
Uanverse
is a type of verse which contains
Silences of Space
and everything inside them. Their shape, although spherical-looking, is irregular, but its not very easy to notice that.
The Uanverses also contain a lot of poison at their outer layer, that could even kill some gods. It also has craters that are home to unknown entities. Some places are transparent, and there's a hole that leads you to the abyss. Uanverses are also very cold, at a whopping -5,982,376°F. They're made of an unknown element. They also manages to contain verses that have higher dimensionality than them, despite that being seemingly impossible. Some holes in this verse have slowed time.
