Introduction
[
]
A
Cyclooped Earth
(CE for short) is similar to
Earth
design-wise (thus the name), but in them the equivalent of oxygen is an element that can be described as similar to gaseous mercury, known as
Kigamerium
. They also have
their moons
INSIDE them instead of the latters rotating AROUND them, and something similar applies to
their suns
. Some CEs can be outside a CS (short form of Cyclooped Sun) but in that case they need to be within a
Cyclooped Galaxy
.
Cycloops
[

So, we already explained the "Earth" part of a CE's name, but why the "Cyclooped" one? Well, most
Cycloop
structures have a bunch of weird entities in them known as "Cycloops", which appearance-wise look similar to Cyclopoids. They have a slighty different name so its easier to recognize each one. Cycloops are made of solid Kigamerium, and when they die they fade into gaseous Kigamerium, so they're pretty much breathing the remains of dead ones. If a Cycloops doesnt consume Kigamerium in time, it'll die in roughly 1
OYC
. Cycloops are insanely strong, and can destroy
Veknaboxes
with ease. The reason it takes so long for them to die over lack of Kigamerium is because most of it remains in them and fades away slowly, so getting rid of their internal ""oxygen"" is a good way to defeat a Cycloop.
Cycloops' intelligence and kardashev scale greatly varies in each Cyclooped Earth. In some they lack any intelligence above the one of a wild animal, and in others they're so smart they can even control their local Cyclooped Galaxy. Their appearance also varies slighty in each CE.
