A
Periodicverse
is a type of
Universe
where only one element from the periodic table is allowed to exist. These
Universes
are
rare and unstable
.
Star and planetary formation practically doesn't exist in these Universes. Since the laws of physics are bent to such a degree that the only stable atomic structure is that of a singular model, many other things are also deformed conceptually, and thus these Universes, whilst still bearing known concepts, can be very wild.
There exist 1,447
Periodicverses
, 1,425 of which are located inside of our
Metaverse
, whilst 21 others are located in the Intermetoidal Void (the void between Metaverses), and only 1 is inside of another
Archverse
, that being a rogue
Multiverse
.
Periodicverses
are spread out randomly like white noise, it seems that their property is merely a "genetic mutation" of intertwining laws of physics upon the formation of Multiverses.
Periodicverses
can be separated into 5 major groups:
Major groups
Element
Amount
H-Periodicverses
411
He-Periodicverses
186
Li-Periodicverses
173
Fe-Periodicverses
253
U-Periodicverse
86
There are many minor groups since the majority of the periodic table has at least 1
Periodicverse
associated with it, but most of the
Periodicverses
with elements of high proton counts don't even have any atoms, due to the fact that every single other atom is unstable, so for the stable atom to form, its particles must go through a very specific process to immediately arrange themselves in the correct order.
H-Star
[
]
An
H-Star
is a star composed primarily out of an extremely hot glowing
mercury-like
substance.
H-Stars
are very rare, verses which allow only mercury to be formed, can create these, and
even then
, there's a tiny chance of there being one.
So far, only 151,812
H-Stars
exist in all Periodicverses.
Their size ranges from 40,000 - 200,000 km.
