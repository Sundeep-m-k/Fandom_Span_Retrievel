This is a nonlinear hierarchy of ranges larger than
The Biggest EVER
. Expect brainrot that does not make any logical sense, as the entries here are beyond everything to a higher degree than previous entries, and their absolute size and truer attributes cannot be found or measured. Nonexistent hyperpseudoconcepts we cannot understand are present. Endless other terms of pure brainrot are present. Nothing here makes or will make any sense. Everything here is abstract beyond abstraction.

A categorical name to the 3,194,286,317,992,545,776,262,117,882,899,990,000 unlisted listed entries. Accidentally discovered by
SITRADA.
As it uses a class system, you can expect a (ridiculously) larger extension of the original class systems that were mirrored much before.
The Letter Web
Lettervoid
Iourargeret
(we know this is larger than the letter web, that is all)
Win
Those are the 4 smallest entries in this range.
