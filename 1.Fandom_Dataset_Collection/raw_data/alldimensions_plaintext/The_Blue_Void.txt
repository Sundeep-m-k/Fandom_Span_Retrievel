The
Blue Voids
are
voids
containing the
Universe Swarms
and have a bunch of blue fog floating around in them.
A Blue Void’s gas is toxic to inhale or exhale, and it can burn skin in one touch so don’t go peeking around in there. The reason it’s so toxic is that it’s made of the 200th element,
toxicium
. If there’s too much of it, it can make stuff disappear.
The Blue Voids aren't actually a void without the gas. They have tiny
dentists
in them. A super tiny civilization lives in the dentists of our local Blue Void, simply known as the
Blue Voiders
. They are advanced because they made it all the way to the
Primordialverse
.
There is some parts of the Blue Voids that are empty which
entities
have photographic evidence of, but have never actually been there. These parts are rare, like
NA's
voids.
