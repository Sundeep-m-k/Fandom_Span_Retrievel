The Great Barriers (Omnisphaera Tenebris, The Final Destination, The End) -
are the final point of all of existence and non-existence. Absolutely inaccessible point even for
the Hyper Dream
and
the All Time
, it means nothing reached and will ever reach the barriers. Even if something will ever reach (hypothetically), it would be impossible to go through them. Even extended cosmology ends at this point, everything that's beyounded it is literally indescribable.
