. It also exists in all dimensions, except dimensions below 2nd, and has a different property of each dimension's TREEVERSE. In it's planets with life, you can find lots of trees and TREES. TREES are trees that can reach 200-1200 meters of height. It can contain other verses, like there are [n, n

Udekaverses

Vendekaverses
and if the right dimensionality (5D+), they can contain the
Multiverses
. Multiverses are created here as fruits from a big tree in the treeverse.
It's biggest stars are the ꦋ-class stars, with a diameter from 12,741 to 617,194 solar diameters. The smallest classes of stars in a TREEVERSE are ䷨-class stars, with a diameter from 493-611 kilometers in diameter. As this verse's size is extremely really big, you may think that some of it's verses are exactly identical to ours, but no, but it can allow an Earth where humans exist, but have a different history. Only 92n-129n Tree-verse clusters (clusters that the closest verse needs to be <82.3 of itself verses apart, and contain 10+ of the same kind of verses) allow the existence of verses exactly identical to ours.
There are 3 TREEVERSES in a Barrel. Don't confuse three with tree.

Humans
[
]
There are a lot of humans in TREEVERSE, just like Earth humans but they had a different history. The most notable of them are the humans in the Treckimea cluster, which escaped the TREEVERSE and didn't want war with other universes. These humans are the ones that landed on
Tyàts
, and made the
TIC
(Treckimea Intercluster Commerce)
Blastoids
[
]
Blastoids are echinoderms that only live in the TREEverse. Go to
Blastoids
for more information.
Treckimea Humans
[
]
They are one of the 3 TREEVERSE humans that escaped the TREEVERSE and made peace. They founded the
TIC
and only they use it, along with their currency, the riennan, with symbol ᐕ.

of planets of TREEVERSE, there is a element called TREEYUM (T), a element found mostly 74-394 km below the planet's surface. It is a lot harder than diamond, and nearly unbreakable. It is not radioactive, as 3 isotopes are stable, and it has a orange color. It has 64 protons and 2 exotic protons, that means it has the atomic number 64+2i. To be solid, it needs to be in contact with other materials (at least 6-8 μm away from them), otherwise it's going to be gas, but it liquifies at 0.0000000000032°K and solidifies at
1.71

°K when not in contact with other materials. As it is harder than diamond, it is used on 2.8km- skyscrapers, but it cannot hold the pressure so it will fall, so upyte is used.
TREEYUM-141+3i, the most common isotope of TREEYUM. It is also one of the three isotopes of TREEYUM that is stable (the others are T-140+2i and T-129+2i).

(tri-TREEMIUM). It's symbol is M, and it's used to make TREEKITE. It is very rare in the TIC
[

]
, because of the location of TREEMIUM. It also has a blue/purple color, but the purple color is rarer than the blue one. It has 37 protons and 1 exotic protons, meaning it has an atomic number of 37+2i.
TREEKITE

TREEKITE is a synthetic material created by TREEVERSIANS, made to resemble TREEMIUM, and being cheaper, because you can make it by putting

Umite
[
]
The Umite was created by the Treckimea humans, and is the highest Unite rock someone in a radius of 1 billion ly from the Trackimea cluster has ever created. It is
38319124
Ut. It was created with some help of the
squares
, and it is one of the 612 out of 90000001 types of Unite (
10000000
Ut to
100000000
Ut) that isn't radioactive.
Upyte
[
]
The Upyte is a synthetic type of Unite, and it is the most common kind of one. It is very strong (stronger than TREEYUM!), so it is used on building skyscrapers. Treckimea humans that have gone to
Tyàts
also passed that material to squares. They only used it in houses. It is blue.
Bannanite
[
]
The Bannanite is a naturally created element in the TREEverse growing from the giant tree. This mineral is very hardy, strong but bendable. It can also be destroyed by hydrochloric acid. It is made up of nutrients and minerals. It is a very common mineral. This mineral is also the only reason why monkeys live in the TREEverse. It is yellow.
