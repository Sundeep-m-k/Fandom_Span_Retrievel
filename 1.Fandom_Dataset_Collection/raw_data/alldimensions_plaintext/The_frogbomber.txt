The frogbomber is a frogbomber who bombs you with frogs. These frogs look like the one in the image. The frogs are sentient, yes. They are also firecrackers. The frogs are endless in numbers, too.
Frogbomber
what does he rule over anyway?
Frogs and bombs. And frog bombs. And firecrackers. And firecracker bombs. And firecracker frogs. And firecracker frog bombs.
Powerfulness, I guess
Weak, can’t even destroy a
Cetaverse
Good or evil?
Somewhere in-between chaotic neutral and chaotic evil, definately in the “chaotic” category though.
Goals
BOOM BOOM!
Limits
Can’t destroy a
Cetaverse
. Well, not easily, at least.
Weaknesses
None?

Spark types

Normal spark
[
]
These sparks aren’t that strong. They are only about as destructive as a magnitude 2
Sproyong
. They are much, much hotter though, and that’s saying something since we’re comparing this to a sproyong, a huge heat virus. Lots of normal sparks appear and they are the most common spark. They are colored yellow.
Red spark
[
]
Red sparks are like normal sparks. They are the 2nd most common spark. They are 10x as hot as a normal spark. They are good enough at destruction to destroy half of a
Metaverse
, making them extremely destructive, especially compared to a normal spark.
Purple spark
[
]
These are the rarest sparks. They aren’t hot, they are cold. Just a single touch can be -♾ degrees in all temperature types from celsius to fahrenheit to kelvin and more, despite that number being WAY below absolute zero and the fact that there can’t be multiple temperatures at once but now there can. It’s beyond your imagination. They can destroy 1/10 of a
Hyperverse
.
Explosion
[
]
Explosions of frog bombs are pretty deadly. Each frog bomb starts out by unleashing about 100 normal sparks per second for 10 seconds. After those 10 seconds, they speed up to 170 normal sparks per second. after 30 seconds, there are 175 sparks per second (SPS) and 5 red sparks per second (RSPS). After 1 minute, it speeds up again to 250 SPS and 20 RSPS. After 1 minute and 30 seconds, it’s still 250 SPS but now it’s 25 RSPS. After 2 minutes, it’s 500 SPS and 35 RSPS, and it’s even 1 PSPS (purple sparks per second). After 3 minutes it’s 2,000 SPS, 100 RSPS, and 8 PSPS. After 5 minutes it reaches the halfway point of the explosion, releasing 5K SPS and 350 RSPS. Oh, and 30 PSPS. After 7.5 minutes it releases 25K SPS, 1.5K RSPS, and 100 PSPS. After 10 minutes the explosion ends with one final explosion of 1M sparks, 225K red sparks, and 50K purple sparks all at once.

A star could be destroyed by a single spark.
An entire galaxy could too.
A universe should be extremely easy to destroy.
Multiverses are nothing.
A Metaverse should be easy with only 2 red sparks.
A Xenoverse os destroyed quick.
A Hyperverse? 10 Purple sparks should do the trick.
An Omniverse? Isn’t that a bit harsh? Well, whatever. This’ll mostly destroyed in one bomb.
The Box!? Isn’t that a HUGE jump!? That’ll take SO MANY BOMBS! Like, a few BILLION!
What!? A Cetaverse? I can’t destroy THAT!
