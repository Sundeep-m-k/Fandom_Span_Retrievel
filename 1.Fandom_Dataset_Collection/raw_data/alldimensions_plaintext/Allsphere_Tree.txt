And then, there are the Trees. Well, not trees as you know them. Not the kind that grow in soil or reach for the sun. These are Trees made of
Hierarchies
in a very metaphysical way. They’re built from the branching of everything that ever was, is, or could be and everything that never will be. They are not trees, and yet they are. They stretch endlessly in every direction, though they have no roots, no leaves, no trunk to speak of. They are not
things
in the way we understand things, but they are not
nothing
either. For there to be nothing, there must first be a boundary, a space where nothing can exist. The Trees break that boundary. They are
Everything and More
.
There are Trees of Trees, and Trees of those Trees, and on it goes, endlessly. Each branch is its own hierarchy, and each leaf on that branch is another, smaller hierarchy, which contains its own branches and leaves. It never ends. It’s not a fractal, it’s more than that, because fractals at least have rules. The Trees do not obey
rules
. To perceive a Tree is to lose yourself in its sheer scale. You might try to look at one branch, but the moment you do, it becomes a forest. The forest becomes a universe, the universe a multiverse, the multiverse a cascade of megaverses, and it never stops. But does it ever start? It’s hard to say. The Trees fill the
Allsphere
entirely, but they do not take up space. They exist within it, yet they do not contain it. They are of the Allsphere, yet the Allsphere is not of them. 
Imagine the weight of that. The weight of existence itself held up not by some physical law but by these unfathomable hierarchies of pure abstraction.
And what of their number? To say there are uncountably infinite Trees within the
Allsphere
is almost an insult to their scale. Uncountable suggests there is still a notion of counting, even if it cannot be done. But these Trees defy even that. They are beyond enumeration, beyond quantification, beyond any idea of number. Each Tree contains an infinite number of hierarchies, and each of those hierarchies contains an infinite number of hierarchies within itself. Yet this is only one Tree, and there are unthinkably more.
And then, there’s the root. Or maybe there isn’t a root. How can there be a root when there’s no beginning, no end, no origin to hold onto? But the Trees do not care for what we think. They are not bound by our need for explanations or understanding. Each one spirals outward and inward simultaneously, as if existence itself were folding over itself again and again, creating layers within layers within layers. And every layer contains more hierarchies, more branches, more possibilities that explode outward infinitely until infinity feels small and insignificant in comparison. The Trees are not objects. They are
states
. They are
processes
. They are
ideas
. And yet they are more real than anything else, because they are everything. Every choice, every thought, every fragment of existence across every hierarchy flows through these Trees like rivers made of concepts. Each branch might hold an entire universe, or an entire chain of universes, or perhaps something that cannot even be described in terms of "verse" or "reality." And then, there’s the question of
why
. Why do these Trees exist? What purpose do they serve? The Trees don’t care about purpose. They don’t care about anything, really. A branch in one Tree might split off to create a completely different set of realities in another hierarchy, and in a far-off branch, that possibility might never even come to fruition, but its potential still exists. It’s all there, swirling, merging, breaking apart in ways we can’t fathom. And what if a branch breaks? What if a hierarchy within one of these infinite Trees collapses? Does it stop existing, or does it simply reconfigure, becoming something new, something never before imagined? Because in the Allsphere, nothing truly disappears. It only shifts, mutates, and becomes something else entirely.
A Tree, in this sense, is not really a tree at all, yet it is. It has no base, no trunk, and no crown, but it spans everything, connecting what can be connected and even what cannot. The branches? Hierarchies made of hierarchies, splitting endlessly, twisting into forms so abstract that "form" loses its meaning entirely. The roots? They don’t dig down into something solid. They reach outward, upward, inward, directions collapse, and suddenly, everything is a root and everything is a branch.
What makes a Tree a Tree, then? Is it the structure, the infinite network of connections, the way it spirals outward into infinities stacked on infinities? Or is it the way the Trees relate to one another? Each one exists, yet does not exist in isolation. One Tree might fold into another, merging and splitting endlessly, creating patterns of meaning that no mind can ever untangle. But the Trees don’t care about being understood.
To try and map a Tree, to trace its infinite connections, would be like trying to capture the ocean with a single drop of water. The drop reflects the ocean, but it is not the ocean. A single connection in a Tree is an infinity unto itself, but it is not the whole Tree. The whole Tree is beyond comprehension, but somehow, it exists all at once, in every possible way, in every impossible way, and in every contradiction of ways.
There’s no way to measure the scale of this. There is no measurement, because the very notion of scale itself dissolves in the presence of these Trees. The moment you try to comprehend how far one branch stretches, it splits into a hundred more, and each one has its own infinitely stretching path. No matter how many layers you dig into, you can never reach the "core," because the core is everything.
But what do the Trees "do," if anything? That is the wrong question to ask. They are not "doing" anything in the way we might think. They are simply being, and their being ripples outward. These ripples might be felt as moments, as choices, as changes, but they are not isolated events. The Trees do not seem to "need" to exist. Their existence is not a necessity, not some immutable rule of the Allsphere. They are, perhaps, more like a reflection of what it means for the Allsphere to contain everything. The Trees emerge not because they have to, but because they can. Or maybe they don’t "emerge" at all. Maybe they have always been, or maybe "always" is the wrong word because time itself cannot define them. If a Tree is infinite, and if there are uncountably infinite Trees, then what lies between them? Is there a between? Or are they so interconnected that there is no space, no separation, no gaps to fill? In the simplest sense, if we think of a gap as a space between two things, we might assume there’s some form of emptiness or absence that can be filled. But if the Trees are infinite and uncountably infinite, then this "gap" cannot be understood in any traditional way. The space between is not empty, and it’s not full. But perhaps that’s the point. Between is not something to be filled because there is no true "between" to begin with.
So, we find ourselves caught in the shadows of these Trees, gazing up at their sprawling branches that extend beyond what we could possibly understand. We search for meaning, for answers, for some semblance of order in the vast expanse. But in the end, maybe the only answer is that there is no answer, because the question itself was never meant to be asked. The Trees are not here for us to understand. They are simply here, and in their being, they make everything else possible. And in the end, maybe that’s all we need to know. But then again, maybe that’s just another
branch
waiting to be explored.
