The
Hypercube of Fiction
is an
object
containing every fictional
Universe
(Ones thought of by mortals). It exists on
the Ball of The Existence
and is guarded by the Cosmic Animals. It is very often used to gaze into an Universe, or even feel how it is to live in it. The Hypercube is usually considered as a
Metaverse
.
The Hypercube of Fiction packs things as tight as possible. For example, if the only two ideas both consisted of happenings on a single
planet
, with no description of anything outside of their orbit, they would be in the same
Solar System
. Because of this, it is unlikely it will every be full. However if it did, one of three things are theorized to happen:
A. The Hypercube would collapse.
B. The Hypercube would grow by expanding itself outwards.
C. The Hypercube, as well as the Ball of The Existence would grow by gaining an extra dimension.
These theories are all incorrect, because the Hypercube is infinite. The way this works is because
the Third Cog
is contained by it.
