The Unique Location
[
]
The
Unique Location
is a type of
verse
which is responsible of containining many
Upper Spaces
. They also are the
terminators
of
class 17
.
Appearance
[
]
They have no known appearance that can be drawn or imaginated in any form. The closest we've got is a 16-cell hexadecachoron, but their true appearance and structure is unknown.
Local containment
[
]
One of them contains our chaotic Upper Space, but the location itself does have some kind of structure.
The container of our Unique Location
is understood to be so chaotic that it's very challenging to understand its properties, and near impossible to go further into the
Hierarchy
after that.

The Unique Location is a super-void! That means it is a very big and empty void, having only 0.00000000000001% of its volume taken up by matter, and the 'matter' in it is just a very small amount of words, or just a single template. Fill in the super-void by
