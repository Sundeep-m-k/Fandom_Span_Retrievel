The
Structural Defier
contains
The Great Big
somehow, while
The Great Big
contains everything. This is because existence in realities here is an infinite-dimensional space constructed from the Cayley–Dickson construction, rather than a 1d and binary space, with only 2 options.
Each option is represented here. This means that things smaller than this only contain one form of existence in realities, while this contains a whole space of different versions of existence in compact realities. 99% of the realities have the infinite-dimensional space that is described earlier. Only 1% don't, and that are
The Great Bigs
that pop up here and there.
The Structural Defier has very inconsistent temperature due to the interactions of multiple forms of existence, but the temperatures are extremes. Temperatures can go as high as 1 trillion degrees celsius, and can go below absolute zero somehow and as low as negative 1 trillion degrees celsius. As a result, life is pretty much non-existent here.]]
