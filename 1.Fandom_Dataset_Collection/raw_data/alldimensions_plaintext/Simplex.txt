A simplex is the X-dimensional form of the
line segment
-
triangle
-
tetrahedron
series, which is formed by beginning with a
point
and having the next shape in the sequence be a pyramid with the base of the previous shape. For example, a
tetrahedron
is a
triangle
-based pyramid.
The
schläfli symbol
of an X-simplex is
{
3
X
−
1
}
{\displaystyle \{ { 3 }^{ X-1 }\} }
- for example, the
schläfli symbol
of a
pentachoron
(4-simplex) is
{
3
,
3
,
3
}
{\displaystyle \{ { 3 },3,3\} }
.
All simplices are self-dual.
