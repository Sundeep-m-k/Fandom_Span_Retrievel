Class T Star (a sub-type of brown dwarf)
Brown dwarves are
stellar objects
which fall between the biggest
gas giants
and the smallest
stars
in mass. Brown dwarves are not massive enough to create helium from nuclear fusion, although most of them can still undergo deuterium fusion (or even lithium fusion). Most rogue planets are actually brown dwarves.
