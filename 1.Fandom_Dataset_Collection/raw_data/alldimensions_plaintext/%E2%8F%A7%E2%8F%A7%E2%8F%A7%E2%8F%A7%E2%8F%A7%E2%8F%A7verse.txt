The
⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧verse
was a verse very similar to the
⎋⎋⎋⎋⎋verse
, except for the fact that it was a verse based around the symbol ⏧
[

]
instead of ⎋. Like the ⎋⎋⎋⎋⎋verse, the ⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧verse was discovered using the
Anti-Isolationist's Telescope
, but there were no explorations planned. Similarly, there were statues of ⏧ in the ⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧verse, but their composition was unknown.
Destruction
[
]
This section will describe the events that eventually led to the ⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧verse's destruction.
During a routine investigation of the ⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧verse via the Anti-Isolationist's Telescope, a mysterious shape suddenly appeared in the verse. Upon further inspection, it turned out to be identical to the statues of ⎋ found in the
⎋⎋⎋⎋⎋verse
.

Suddenly, all of the statues of ⏧ turned towards the lone statue of ⎋.
The statue of ⎋ suddenly flees.
A very bright object
is seen in the distance, and it seems to be heading to the ⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧verse.
9,154 statues of ⏧ look towards the bright object, with them being instantly vaporized. The remaining statues of ⏧ flee the ⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧⏧verse and escape from it, as the entire verse is crushed by the bright object.
The statues of ⏧ quickly run into the bright object as if they were frantic.
Many statues of ⎋ approach towards the bright object.
They, along with the bright object, disappear.
