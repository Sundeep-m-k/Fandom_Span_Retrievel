Mutated particles are
particles
that were subject to quantum mutation. These particles have different properties than the ones present in their normal counterparts because of a modified
blueprint gene
.
Quantum Mutation
[
]
Quantum mutation is the process of mutating a particle by modifying its blueprint gene. The normal way of mutating a particle is just firing beams of
blueprint particles
at hundreds of millions of times the speed of light, and waiting until one of them replaces one of the blueprint particles in the blueprint gene, replacing the state. Quantum mutation is generally only developed when civilisations reach type-4.8 in the
Kardashev Scale
.

There are lots of routinely-used mutated particles, normally used to create long-standing hadrons.
