The Nmklefvbverse is a verse.
Nmklefvb Gas
[
]
This gas is gas that is extremely toxic and very hard to pass through. It is INSANELY bad.
Escaping the Nmklefvbverse
[
]
It is extremely hard to escape because its barrier is harder to pass than the barrier of the
SAV
! If you try using the same technique as the one for escaping the SAV, The Nmklefvbverse will yell "Eyeball Bucketâ€¼", and you will lose all your progress.
