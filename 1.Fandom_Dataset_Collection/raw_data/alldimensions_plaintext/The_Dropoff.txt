The
Dropoff
is a type of
verse
that, as the name says, 'drops off' into chaos, like the
logistic map
. It has a
fractal
structure
, and also has distinct 'waves' that can be seen around it. It contains mostly
Orbinverses
in it's non-chaotic part, but there are different things when it delves into chaos.

Composition
[
]
The Dropoffs are mainly composed of Orbinverses, with many of them being tesselated in a gasket structure in a huge circular shape. The Dropoffs are usually composed of 3 shells:
Diagram of a Dropoff.
The Order, being composed of just Orbinverses (the circle in the middle), the Chaos (the strange, chaotic looking part), and the Noise (pictured in orange). These three parts have their own properties, and each of them is harder to escape than the last.
The Order
[
]
The Order, which we've said 2 times now, contains Orbinverses in a gasket shape, eventually forming a large circular shape. The surface of these Orbinverses are easy to surpass, but they have a hard enough surface to not collide. The result of this is that a simple Ineffability Drive can get you into the next shell.
The Chaos
[
]
The Chaos, which is much harder to get past than the Order, is where the original 'drop' in any Dropoff is. It is usually split into 2 main areas, before the wave structures, and after them. Both areas have different levels of chaos, and so they have their own parts to be talked about.
Pre-Wave
[
]
This part still is chaotic, but it isn't infinitely chaotic like post-waves. They are composed of both stray Orbinverses and
Gradientverses
, which allow for shifting spectrums. The closer we get to the waves, the more we get smaller or more chaotic Gradientverses. Wormholes begin to form and as verses become more compact, the Dropoffs become darker.
We now approach the waves, as extreme physical properties become different near the waves, causing spirals into a point, and stable sizes shrink, creating a sort of black hole that you will never reach the surface of, as even time becomes compacted. Eventually, when we get to the actual wave, the verses become so small that their
Existance Rank
shrinks to negative sizes.
Post-Wave
[
]
We now have completely delved into chaos. Gradientverses are not enough to keep this stable, so
Versal Fibers
are now found, and Existance Ranks are now able to grow to okay levels. These new structures allow for this area of the Chaos to be brighter, and also increases the blue spectrum of this area. The problem with this, though, is that now Gradientverses fly around, because the Versal Fibers hold them up. This causes the chaos to be extreme, and as we get closer to the end of the Chaos, Versal Fibers become less common and all the verses create something almost impossible to pass.
As we reach the barrier between the Chaos and the Noise, we get one last fractal shape before there is no pattern. After this, we have gone beyond chaos. We have reached noise.
The Noise
[
]
The Noise, which takes up almost all of their Dropoff and is extremely hard to get past, is full of
particles
of many different temperatures, speed, dimensions, and size. This makes the Noise very chaotic, noisy, random, and hard to get past. The reason that it's so hard to pass is because colliding particles and patches and layers upon layers of particles that are near or at absolute zero in temperature, making them very hard to pass.
Eventually, we get to a barrier that even almost all drives cannot pass, so we need a strong drive. This allows us to finally escape the Dropoff we're in, but not before we realize that there are many others of the first two shells, making 'pockets of chaos' as their discoverers called them. After getting past those barriers, you can escape into the
next
verse.
