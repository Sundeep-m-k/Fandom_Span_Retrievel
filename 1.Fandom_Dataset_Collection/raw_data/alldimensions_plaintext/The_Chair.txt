The Chair
is an enormous chair in
The Room
.
The Chair has a creature underneath it that slowly eats that chair just like how the
Shadow
eats
The Table
. It is assumed to be the Shadow's little brother.
The Chair
is infinitely big, and stretches infinitely in every direction.
The Chair is
usually depicted as an IKEA chair
, as shown in the image. However, The Chair is not made from wood, and is instead composed entirely of
Primordium Delta
.
A groove on The Chair's surface seems to suggest that an entity has sat on The Chair. It is unknown who this entity is, but whoever did that must be extremely huge and fat.
The Chair
is burning hot
. If you touch The Chair, you will
most likely vaporize immediately and die
. It is unknown why that happens. The creatures inside The Chair can withstand the scorching temperatures though.
