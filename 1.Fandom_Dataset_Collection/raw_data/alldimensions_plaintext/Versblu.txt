Versblu
is a verse that will never be referenced in a color that's not blue. If it is done at any point in time, the source of the non-blue reference becomes a contradiction black hole, and time is altered so that it was never referenced in a color that's not blue.
Versblu
also will never contain non-blue light waves, and the same thing happens with referencing it in not blue with non-blue light waves being in
Versblu
, where the non-blue light waves become contradiction black holes, and time is altered so that there was always only blue light waves in
Versblu
. It's nigh-impossible to enter
Versblu
because your non-blue light waves would become contradiction black holes. This causes contradiction black holes to cover the surface of
Versblu
, though the contradiction black holes only last for a second, causing
Versblu
to just look like a circular blue noise map from the outside.
This also makes it nigh-impossible to speak of
Versblu
, as sound waves are colorless, and voice can still reference things, so the sound waves would also become contradiction black holes.
