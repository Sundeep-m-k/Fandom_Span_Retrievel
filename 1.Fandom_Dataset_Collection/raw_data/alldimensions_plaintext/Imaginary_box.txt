Barrels
Tesseracthedron, is a structure that blind with Barrels to create structures in
The Box
, it is a 4 dimensional polyhedron. If the Barrels allow to have this Imaginary box then it exists and stabilise. The Imaginary box is a fake box to make the other believe it’s the real box, the box contains Rayos Number barrels, the Imaginary box is invisible but when you see it through the Hypercosmological glasses it will appear like a blue tesseract, the same thing with other Imaginary __hedrons. 

The Imaginary boxes have an existence rank of 0.1 which make them close to nonexistence and invisible, an average Imaginary box contains about 5000 tritar to 15.8 Rayos Number barrels. The Imaginary box act like an imaginary barrier to the barrels, the lowest record of the most Imaginary box that have the lowest barrels is IB-1024 it have just 12 barrels
The Hypercosmological glasses are glasses that help you see lower or higher existence rank verses or entities, as well the 4th 5th and the other dimensions , not just that, you can also pick up some information about the verse that you see automatically by watching through the lenses.
