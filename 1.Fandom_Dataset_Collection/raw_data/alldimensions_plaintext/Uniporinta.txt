The new Uniporinta, just banged in 2015, June 5. It is still very active. It is getting colder by throwing porintathito flares at our
Universe
. Even in 2085, it will still be very active. Yet the Uniporinta is getting closer to our
Universe
. Well, how many years will it be active? Well, billions of years. Right now, in 2015 it is only 1 micrometer long. But the big question is will there be life there? Yes, there will be the same life there is on Earth. Just the math is crazy because it is located in the
Le Jorino Area
.
