About
[
]
Deltoids (AKA.The Eyes) are super clusters of
Origama
, and Since the Deltoid is so big it acts like a
Multiverse
. Deltoids mind-control anything that gets near them so they can grow their empire, the can also control universes, but they can only mind-control anything that is smaller then them. A Deltoid has more dimentions because of the space-time it curves. Since there is so much gravity and bending, the 3D objects go into dimentional spaces they cant go in.
Outer Disk
[
]
The Outer Disks are big chains of
Origama
packed together, they form moss-like formations. The outer disks have only 3 dimentions makeing orbits only possible there. The Outer Disks are also 1 multiverse wide, makeing it the longest thing in the Deltoids.
I will not continue this. Update the page and add more info.
