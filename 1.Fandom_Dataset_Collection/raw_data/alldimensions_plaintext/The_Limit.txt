A
Limit
is what the name implies to. This type of
verse
limits things that simply should not happen, working as a barrier. They're veeery hard to pass through while not being truly limited, so they have a "truer" form known as the
True Limits
. Despite being a limit, they actually still start a new chain. The Limits are also the foundational verses of the True Limits and are a major component of
Limit Areas
, especially the bigger ones.
They limit (a barrier) for smaller verses to become too extreme because of their small size, so there is a law. These verses, if getting too extreme, could get erased from existence, forevermore. But only a lucky chance as there's more, the True Limits, to stop the thing and once it the verse is at the Limit Areas level, it becomes no longer being extreme. With the exception of
Neverythings
and
Post-Neverythings
due to not being smaller than a Limit. In fact, they're already containing some forms of the Limits.

Element
[
]
Their element, called limtium is the element no. Œ©+Œ© exists within the Limits and anything larger. The element is what makes this verse a limit. Since not enough elements are here, a Limit is the most permeable and laxest verse in the chain. Limitium has the property to change the size of a verse to a smaller one. This will keep them from crooked within an
Extreveverse
.
Materials made of Limitium
[
]
There's some materials that are entirely made of limitium, which are:
Limitium balls
[
]
A Limitium ball is like a magnifier (maybe as shown in the infobox) making a clearer and easier to detect some
Post-Absolutes
. They exists in more dimensions than in the Limits themselves too, but the reason of this is yet a controversy.
Limitium tiles
[
]
The tiles of this kind are why a Limit actually has the ability to limits things. The redder the tiles are, the more dangerous they could to exit a Limit. The same goes for True Limits except that the tiles are one step higher (that's is less verses are able to escape it and it's more easily done).
Voids
[
]
A Limit sure has a lot of voids due to too many verses were never to be existant again. And there are a lot of Limitium element across a Limit, but most of it has to be eliminated so that there would be less voids. As a
Post-Never
is relatively big to the Limits, the element named
Voidancitium
is reducing the amount of life from them, and without life, then there may be 100% void in the Limits. But for all of this void percent is reducing and life percent is growing.
