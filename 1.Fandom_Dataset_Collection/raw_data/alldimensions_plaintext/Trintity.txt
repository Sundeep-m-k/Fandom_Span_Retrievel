The
trintities
are a civilization superior to
Bintity
and inferior to Quadrity. They have colonized 2
universes
(the one we and Zerity live in, and the nearest one) and achieve status as a type 4.5 civilization. The trintities unleashed armageddon on the first few alternate Trintities and
Bintities
in the other universe they found, because they had an existential crisis. They are disunited in other ways too, because their civilization is divided into TREE(3) villages the size of asteroids
