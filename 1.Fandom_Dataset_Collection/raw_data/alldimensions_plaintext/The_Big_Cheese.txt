Bossbot HQ
The Big Cheese is the ultimate "gigachad" among the Cogs—a formidable powerhouse with an intense hatred for Toons, fueled by his disdain for their slapstick antics. He was last spotted on Walrus Way, the street connecting The Brrrgh to Donald's Dock.
The most despised figure in the eyes of the Cogs is Flippy, the Toon leader and, of course, the Mayor of Toontown. Not only is he the top Toon, but he also holds the unusual position of being the eighth Cog on the Bossbot corporate ladder, making him a unique and controversial figure in both Toon and Cog circles.
In 2016, the Cogs initiated a scheme known as
Operation: Business Explosion
. This project aims to strip Toontown of its humor and slapstick charm, transforming it into a dull, efficiency-driven place where Cogs, not Toons, hold control. If successful, Toontown would become a part of the growing Cog Nation, forever changing the Toon way of life.
However, the Toons wouldn’t stand for it. They launched an all-out war against the Cogs, igniting what would become the most significant event in Toontown's history. After an intense battle, the Toons emerged victorious, restoring the humor and slapstick that define their world. By 2023, they not only reclaimed Toontown but also took control of Cog Nation, rebranding it as
Toon Nation
, ensuring that laughter and fun would rule once more.
