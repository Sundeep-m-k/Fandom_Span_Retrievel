It is called the Addictionverse for a reason, because if a
human
entered it, the special forcefield around the verse would make the human not want to leave, making them virtually stuck in this verse until they inevitably die from one of many causes. This happens because because the strong forcefield around the AddictionVerse will trick the brain of the human. This makes them think that they have everything here and that it's a paradise, though it's not since it's just a bunch of planets. The brains of other creatures, including other sapient species and animals, are not affected. While it is possible for human life to survive on some of the planets in the Addictionverse, it is very rare.
