Matter Information
can be defined as the information which represents any bit of matter. It's not a physical object, rather a sort of "code" which defines every possible property of an object. Abstract properties such as size or weight are merely byproducts of a larger set of properties, which themselves can be broken down, just like size, on and on, until one hits the bottom and stumbles upon individual information "bits".
Nobody actually knows what information is
. It is known what it does, its effects have been documented, but actually sensing or decoding or even writing down this information is currently theorized to be physically impossible.
Information of an object could be a set of complex elements that almost work as an encoder, information could be an endlessly complex indescribable graph, information could be something totally unimaginable to any
Real
being, as it very likely is. However, nothing has been proven yet and scientists aren't even sure where to begin.
It is known that laws of Universes are encoded within their information, just as all laws on all verses, but Universes are born in a very predictable way. Thus, studying them in painful detail may bring about clues for actual work to be done on this subject.
