The containment tree.
Ütorÿnùù-ÿtkop is a verse
[

]
that contains the
numberverseobject chain
. It is an indirect container of all smaller objects. The verse can be described as containing the main hierarchy / main chain, which is an unending chain of verses and other structures that includes most of the pages on the wiki, as well as all counterparts and branches from it. It is therefore similar to
boxes
, as it contains everything smaller than it.
Squidwarp instances
have never been observed outside of it, but it is likely that they do form outside and observational equipment simply is not sophisticated enough to observe them outside.
Containment tree
[
]
Ütorÿnùù-ÿtkop can be visualized as the eventual direct or indirect container of all objects that exist within a "tree" that would have the main branch be the main hierarchy / main chain, and other sibling hierarchies being branches that would stem from a common contained object (which is smaller than
True Nothing
or whatever the smallest object in
The Pre-Hierarchy
currently is, because it is before the main hierarchy as well as all other hierarchies that exist on the wiki that conclude with an object smaller than and therefore contained by Ütorÿnùù-ÿtkop). It is better explained by the image below, which shows other branches stemming from the counterpart hierarchies and main hierarchy. This main chain would include all of the class systems, and the other chains would include similar classifications, like tiering systems. There would be intermediate common containers of all lower objects (most commonly in the main chain) spread throughout the tree, where all smaller objects are directly or indirectly contained by them, and Ütorÿnùù-ÿtkop contains all of these. After Ütorÿnùù-ÿtkop, the full containment hierarchy will follow one chain until a branching out of some sort later on.
Creator
[
]
The verse has a ruler (god/creator) that created it a very long time ago, and has 2.5 ütorÿnùù-ÿtkops (ÜŸ/UY) of power. Nothing is important about him. Name of the creator is D'egg.

Technically not a verse because it is post-versal.
