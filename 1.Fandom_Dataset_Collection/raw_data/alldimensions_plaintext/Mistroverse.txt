The
Mistroverses
are the 5th smallest post-
Omniversal
type of
verse
. They are completely covered in gas, giving them the appearance of a green-ish verse.
Also, this type of verse is the first one in the
chain
of
gas-verses
, which are responsible of usually containing only lower verses, gas, and nothing else.
Structure
[
]
Mistroverses have a plain verse structure, without layers or something other. This is a very boring verse tho. Like every other gas-verse, there are large
Meskoverse
cluster in their center, and then containment destiny reduces.
