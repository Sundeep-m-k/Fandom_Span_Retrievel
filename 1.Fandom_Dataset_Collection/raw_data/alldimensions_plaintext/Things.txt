A
Things
is a collection of many different... things. Hence its quite straightforward name.
It includes footballs, couches, explosives, rocks, pillows,
planets
, guns,
verses
, and more. There isn’t much to say other than that everything is glued together.

Glue
[
]
The glue appears to be the same glue as the glue on the
Stickverse
, although further research is necessary. It also appears to have copies of
The Verse Trap
stuck in the glue, although, again, further research is needed. There appears to be gold stuck in the glue, as well as signs of “alternate universe” copies of
Thegatus
(not proven, although lab work is ongoing).
Use
[
]
Things has no practical use except as an automatic glue maker in the Glue company.
Growth
[
]
A Things grows by either grabbing nearby objects and turning them into glue or by sticking nearby objects on the glue, if there is enough. If it finds another Things, it will merge with that Things if possible.
Within "Solid Light"
[
]
The Things in
"Solid Light"
are a bit different. They won’t merge or grow, and the unconfirmed Thegatus clones have no signs of existing there. These Things are also much larger, but have slightly weaker glue. Additionally, it generates a small amount of light, and has living things living in the glue. They are also less compact, with more glue between objects and objects being further away. Further research on this variant and just Things in general is needed.
