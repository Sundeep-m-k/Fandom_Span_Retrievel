The
Tesseract
is an object shaped like... well a
tesseract
. It is constructed from tessellated
Yellow Wekamultonic Geopamultons
, and although it is constructed from these, it is not constructed from them
directly
.
Composition
[
]
So why is it 'not constructed' by Yellow Wekamultonic Geopamultons? Well, this is because it is the verse constructed from infinite
Archrealities
of The Yellow Wekamultonic Geopamulton, or in other words,
R
The Yellow Wekamultonic Geopamulton
œâ
{\displaystyle R^\omega_\text{The Yellow Wekamultonic Geopamulton}}
[

]
, which is the same as the Archreality of the Archreality of the Archreality of the... of The Yellow Wekamultonic Geopamulton.
This does not mean that The Tesseract is
only
composed from Yellow Wekamultonic Geopamultons, though. It also has voids of
Absolute Darks
, although this is relatively unsurprising.
Properties
[
]
The Tesseract, although being shaped like a tesseract, has invisible cells and everything else is a hyperspherical shell around it, and this spherical barrier is constructed from
Absolute Balances
.
