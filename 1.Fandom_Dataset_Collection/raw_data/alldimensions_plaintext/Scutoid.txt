Not Much Is Known About This Shape Since It Was Discovered Recently (As Of August 2, 2018), But It Could Be One Of The Answers Of Why Life Exists.
It Is A Geometric Solid Beetween 2 Parallel Surfaces, The Boundary Of Each Surface Is A Polygon, And Vertices Of The 2 End Polygons Are Joined By Either A Curve Or A Y-Shaped Connection.
Scutoids Present At Least One Vertex Beetween These 2 Planes. Scutoids Are Not Necessarily Convex, And Its Lateral Faces Are Not Necessarily Planar, So Several Scutoids Can Pack Up To Fill All Space Between The Two Surfaces.
They May Be More Generally Described As A Mix Of A
Frustum
And
Prismatoid
