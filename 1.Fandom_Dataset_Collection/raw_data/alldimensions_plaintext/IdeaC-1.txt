Idea-C1 is an artificially generated containment structure (specifically a benevolent artificial
Black Box
) for the purposes of researching abstract concepts. It is located next to
Universe
47-10^18280B10^18279ACD. It has an approximate radius of 485 trillion light years. Hostile/virulent ideas are compressed and uploaded to Idea-C1, where they can be studied and undergo natural ideatic evolution. Ideas, as stated before, are contained via an artificially generated (empty) black box, manually sculpted using observations gathered from research of other black boxes.
Idea-C1 is expected to be upgraded to contain more complex ideas in the near future.
