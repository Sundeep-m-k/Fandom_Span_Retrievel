timeless is not a verse. It seems to be an entirely different thing altogether. Portals to enter timeless have been created, however only unreasonably powerful entities (such as some Transcendence Gods and machines can do so. Once something is in timeless, it cannot be retrieved from timeless. This makes timeless good for banishing CEs and very dangerous objects.
For the most part, timeless is a barren void that goes on forever, using "forever" in its most Transcendence form. This thing has no size, it's just fully endless in every dimension and direction. There are barely any light sources in here, all of which were either sent into timeless or created by the things in there and not directly from timeless itself. Even if there was a light source near a portal, no light could be retrieved from timeless, so the portal remains black.
Signals can be sent into timeless and then received by objects in timeless, as a one-way form of contact. This doesn't work the other way however, due to the properties of timeless not letting anything out of it.
Objects

Dust Particle Machine
[
]
There seems to be some can in timeless that is creating dust particles. These particles have strange properties, with each one seemingly having their own. The dust particles are being collected by COT, and their properties are being examined, and they are seeing if they can use them to their advantage.
Civilization of Timeless
[
]
This is an entire civilization formed by the entities that were banished to timeless, intentionally or unintentionally. Most entities in timeless either die or join COT. This civilization studies the objects inside timeless and defends itself from intruders.
idk what else to put here jajaja
