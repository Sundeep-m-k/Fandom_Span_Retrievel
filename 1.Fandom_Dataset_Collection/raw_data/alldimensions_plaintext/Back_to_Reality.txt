Back to Reality
is a complex of verses with varying
Existence Ranks
and
EUSIs
, hence the name. They contain 40
۝s
in a random packing at their core, although there is a lot of space between them full of
exotic matter
and
dark matter
, so entities such as
Equilateral
set up strip-mining operations here. Back to Realities are much, MUCH more unstable than ۝s, Exas, Kentos, Perches or really anything else in sub-14th class. They will eject

Escape Attempts
[
]
Back to Reality is very hard to escape, not because of the size (it's manageable for extremely advanced civilizations), but because the ejected verses including Orbitings are all getting thrown out right at the border where you escape, so your trajectory need to be accurate to 1/
Endless Perch
meter-precision, which is only doable by the quantum entities such as
Dave
,
Proto
or
Scalene
which never venture any further than their local
Oakverse
. But people have tried, and most attempts failed or were semi-successful in that they got out but the conditions outside were inhospitable and the crew died.
Attempt 1
[
]
This attempt was performed by an
Attee
who was mounting an
Aquarius
. They also had brought along several small entities from
Earth
such as
Owl
and
Oxpecker
that could determine their trajectory with extreme precision due to their small size. But unknown to them, even the utterly small size of Earth entities wasn't enough to dodge all of the verses, and 5 earth hours later, in they crashed into a
Cetaverse
and died.
Attempt 2
[
]
This attempt was performed by the one and only
FireWater
who heard about the death story of the Aquarius. This time, the FireWater had a
Stealbot
who could move out the verses. But the FireWater ran out of fuel after 65 earth days so he cancelled the mission and took another few days to return to his local
Universe
.
