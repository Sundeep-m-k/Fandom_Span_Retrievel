Nosphs
are enormus collections of
Diversities
that are imagined by the same species as
Alphasm
. These collections, despite being imaginary, exist in
Orbis
and
The Spires
in the same way that objects exist in
The Box
. Nosphs pack their Diversities very close together, and there are several civilizations who have used the imaginary property of Nosphs to allow them to travel at unfathomable speeds. Because of this, Nosphs are commonly used for fast travel throughout
Orbis
and
The Spires
.
Nosphs on average contain about 50,000 Diversities, but some have been found to contain over 10,000,000 and some less than 150. The reason that Nosphs exist is because they seperate the imaginators from the imagined. If this seperation did not occur, then the imaginators might meet their imagination in physical form, giving them almost unlimited power over the realm of the imaginators. If they are evil, they could kill other imaginators, destroying entire realms. Orbis and The Spires that did not seperate the imaginators and imagined did not grow and therefore could not make more coros and reproduce, causing Nosphs to exist.
