Eights
("
Gak
" in
The Pencil Language
or
Yot
in Future English) are the 2nd to last and 2nd biggest verses in the
One Chain
.
Structure
[
]
Eights have a structure that is very simple. They just contain one huge cylinder that takes up about 43% of their total space, and like always, 8
Sevens
.
The Cylinder
[
]
The cylinders contain all the 8 Sevens that are inside of an Eight, and keeps them from flying all over the place, thus preventing collisions between them. This cylinder also has a mechanism which allows it to lock every Seven inside it
extremely
securely, and another mechanism that allows it to eject everything that is inside it.
The exact purpose for those mechanisms are still unknown, since the cylinder is already extremely secure, and has absolutely no need to eject the Sevens inside it either.
Properties
[
]
Eights have some interesting properties.
Eighst can somehow move straight through a
Nine
's borders. It is still unknown how this works.
Eights can somehow disappear randomly at certain intervals, just like many other verses in the One Chain.
Eights seems to be able to give off a blue/white gas of some sort every 9
OYC
. This gas can corrupt their surroundings, and cause a lot of damage to them. This gas has not been seen anywhere else.
