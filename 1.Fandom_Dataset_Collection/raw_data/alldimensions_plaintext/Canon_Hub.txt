"Because one massive hierarchy wasn't enough."
Put your alternate hierarchies, scenarios, headcanons, and such here! Anyone is free to add to this list, so show people your creativity!
Canons
[
]
The Main Canon
[
]
The largest canon, basically a free for all with little solid "rules" for it, so it isn't so much a canon as it is a lack of a canon.
Best for standalone pages and small-ish series of verses.
Important stuff:
The Official Hierarchy
The Extended Hierarchy
The Post-Hierarchy
Everything Layer
Existence Rank
Finality Index
