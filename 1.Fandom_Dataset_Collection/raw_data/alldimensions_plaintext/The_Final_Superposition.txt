As you'd expect by the name, the
Final Superposition
is a type of verse that has multiple different properties at the exact same time, in this case the Final Superposition has the property of being many
Existence Ranks
at the exact same time, ranging from
−
ω
{\displaystyle -\omega}
to
∞
(

{\displaystyle \infin(0,1)}
.
The chaos of
the Final Limbos
inside it makes this verse vary a lot in temperature, due to it also containing a verse that is extremely cold and currently unnamed. These two verses are not the only kinds found in the Final Superposition, although only
the Final Limbo
has been named.

Verses In the Final Superposition
[
]
There are currently 4 known verses found in the Final Superposition. The last 2 also have multiple Existence Ranks at once, although the Final Superposition has a larger range of Existence Ranks compared to all the other.
The Final Limbo
[
]
See
The Final Limbo
.
Cold Verse
[
]
This verse has an Existence Rank of
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
. It is not very large, only slightly larger than the size of an
Omniverse
, but its laws allow temperatures in negative degrees Kelvin, causing a large area of effect (around the size of The Final Limbo).
Simultaneous Existence Rank Verse 1
[
]
This verse is a bright lime green and travels at very fast speeds. When it impacts a Final Limbo, gigantic amounts of heat are released, enough to cause the Simultaneous Existence Rank Verse 1 to disintegrate. It is thought that eventually there will be no Simultaneous Existence Rank Verse 1s left.
The existence ranks of this verse range from
−
1
{\displaystyle -1}
to
ω
2
{\displaystyle \omega^2}
.
Simultaneous Existence Rank Verse 2
[
]
This is the rarest verse found inside the Final Superposition, there are only 10 known. Due to this, there is not much known information on it, although we do know the Existence Ranks of the verse range from
≈
−
10
10
2.67634
{\displaystyle \approx-10^{10^{2.67634}}}
to
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
. It contains a barrier that is made of carbon-14, although the only objects that have been found inside are tulips of various colors.
The Final Superposition is in a superposition
[
]
The strangest part about the Final Superposition is that every Final Superposition is exactly the same, so it is in a 'superposition' of sorts. Whenever an object exits it, it exits every single position, although each object then can act differently then all its copies, basically splitting off.
This was discovered when a ship first exited the Final Superposition, as communication devices were overwhelmed from the amount of input coming in. Due to the different situations each ship was in, the crew all said different things or acted differently, although they had the same starting condition.
When the Final Superposition is entered again, the object will 'collapse' into one object, although this happens over time to keep the laws of physics from breaking entirely.
