In
OYC
12,000 our local
Spire
became an
Orbi
. Our Orbi contains Realms in a very disordered fashion, and all traces of patterns that there might have been when it was a Spire are gone. At the center of all Orbis there seems to be a large convulsing mass, this is its coro. Depending on the stability of an Orbi, it changes its apparent color, ours is green, meaning it is very stable. If an Orbi happens to get spiked by the tip of a Spire, it will start to deform around it until the Orbi almost completely surrounds the Spire, after this happens, it will snap back to its original shape and fly at a very high speed into a
sky
. When an Orbi is born from a Spire, the seven Spirals that gaurded that The Spire will let themselves be absorbed into the Orbi.
The more cosmical energy an Orbi absorbs, the larger it grows. When an Orbi reaches 1500x the size of its coro, it begins to emit a very bright glow with enough luminosity to light up an entire 30th of its local
Field
. These Orbis are known as Type 2 Orbis. When a Type 2 Orbi becomes 3100x the size of its coro, it begins to condense itself into several coros, which it then drops into the Field. When the coros have stayed in the field for 408,030 seconds, they sprout into a new Spire.
