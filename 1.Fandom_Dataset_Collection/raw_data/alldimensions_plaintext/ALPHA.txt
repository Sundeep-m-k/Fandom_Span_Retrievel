ALPHA
is a giant sphere, bounded by an invisible layer. In its insides, are an infinite amount of
chaos particles
, ranging in side anywhere from a couple millimeters,
all the way to a third of
ALPHA
itself.
ALPHA
particles have no surface tension, mass or gravity to them. All of the particles jitter at insane speeds inside of the
ALPHA
and push around objects in brownian motions.
The Other Box, which was originally contained in the geometric center, has been pushed around in a brownian walk for many, many
OYCs
, and has been getting
closer and closer to the barrier of the
ALPHA
.
It is unknown what will happen then
, when it hits itself against the edge, but the two leading theories are those which state, that it will either
bounce off like any other chaos particles
, or simply
pass through
, into the OMEGA.
It is important to know this, as
the Box
is contained inside of The Other Box, and any threats posed to it
must be evaluated and instantly acted upon to be prevented.
