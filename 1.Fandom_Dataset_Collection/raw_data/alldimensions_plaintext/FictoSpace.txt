The FictoSpace is the pool of every fictional verse, DC, Marvel, AD, SCP, DBZ, JJK, ect, ect, ect.
Characters that exist only in FictoSpace and not any verse within it is considered “Fictic”
You can’t contain this in AD anymore.

It is the pool of everything fictional, and it doesn’t exist under the All Dimensions canon as it contains it, this means it bypasses containment by the
Allsphere
and such. This is a part where I bring up a piece of FG terminology, “Collapsing”, Collapsing is defined as follows:
if a fictional object N says it is has a property X that is impossible (eg. fiction) then it is collapsed to not have X anymore and to where fits such power of having X IF possible.
How this applies is that things like the
FANDOMverse
and the
All Dimensions Wiki
are somewhat impossible to get by without being collapsed.
Excuses cannot be created via verses to contain FictoSpace however, as it contains both the AD canon and fanon, two things which contain the
FANDOMverse
and
All Dimensions Wiki
due to them being canon, which also ticks Ignorance and by extension Definitional strength as FG terminology that is able to be translated into AD/Verse logic.
however, the FictoSpace follows no logics, no rules, and no definitions, therefore, ignoring it does nothing. It isn’t canon or fanon to AD as it is simply beyond it
beyond the FictoSpace is still FictoSpace, not even a copy of it or it’s borders if it had one.
