Anti-Boxes
are one of the smallest type of Boxes ever known. The Anti-Boxes are also a
verse
contained by everything that exists and doesn't exists. So, it could be thought of as
the Boxes
' opposite, being the reason of their given name.
They also could be thought of an equivalent of
ƨǝxoꓭ
but they attract anything that has an
Existence Rank
of 1, 0 and -1 and any fractional existence ranks in-between of these numbers. They also contains themselves and contained by themselves, mostly infinitely many times, just like a Box. It is normally contained by
Verseomnis
and Boxes and contains
Versecetas
. Its existence rank is
negaexistence
(existence-(-1)).
Both the Anti-Boxes and
ƨǝxoꓭ
group together to form larger objects in the
Verseuni Chain
.
Layers
[
]
The Anti-Boxes have many layers due to because they are self-containing. The layer at which an Anti-Box is at the normal state is called layer 0. The smallest layer would be layer -∞ and largest would be layer ∞. Each layer has got the number for how many times an Anti-Box has been self-contained. Also, some of the layers contain objects smaller than or equal to their size.
