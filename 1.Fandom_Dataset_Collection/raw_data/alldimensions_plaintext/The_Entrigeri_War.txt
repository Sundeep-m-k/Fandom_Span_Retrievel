The Entrigeri
and their relatively unknown invaders (which will be referred from now on as just "The Invaders").

The Entrigeri were living their normal lives in
100232
, when a small, alien ship which belonged to The Invaders passed by the verse. The Entrigeri, as their technology was still relatively basic, did not notice the ship.
After about 13.4 Earth days, 4 more ships passed by. More ships passed by for about 59 Earth days, when they were finally spotted by The Entrigeri when one of them broke a hole inside 100232's barrier and ventured inside. The ship was armed.
The Entrigeri noticed the ship's weapons. 5 armed Entrigeri spacecraft were sent to monitor the ship. When the ship discovered the Entrigeri spacecraft, they fired upon them, destroying 2 of them before the remaining Entrigeri ships took down the alien craft.
In the following weeks, over 500 alien spacecraft entered 100232 and started claiming territory all across the outer regions of 100232. The Entrigeri now knew that another species were invading them.
The Battles of Jum-Xolc
[

The Entrigeri gathered over 100,000 soldiers and began setting up small bases on many planets. 653 Entrigeri spacecraft were sent to attack the 500 ships sent by The Invaders to conquer 100232. A large battle ensued, with the Entrigeri losing 549 spacecraft and The Invaders losing 381.
The Invaders began attacking small planets which were occupied with a large Entrigeri force. They successfully took the heavily defended planet of Joo-Ed and killed over 23,430 Entrigeri soldiers stationed on the nearby planets.
The Entrigeri were starting to get worried, as they were losing battle after battle. However, a relatively small force of only 19,132 Entrigeri, 4,213 spacecraft, and 5,918 armored ground vehicles secured a very important victory by taking control of over 61 entire solar systems and driving The Invaders out of the a large part of 100232.
However, like all things, their victory didn't last long.
The Capturing of the Outer Region
[
]
As The Invaders were running low on supplies, troops, and spacecraft, they brought many more. Over 10,000 spacecraft flew into 100232, with many more slowly destroying 100232's barrier from the outside. The Entrigeri were not prepared for this, and tried to avoid The Invaders as long as possible while they were building up their military. Small skirmishes between The Invaders and The Entrigeri happened, with The Invaders eventually launching a full-on assault against The Entrigeri in the outer regions of 100232.
The outer region of 100232 was being swept over by The Invaders, as it was poorly defended. After a long debate, The Entrigeri's government decided to send all of their still half-developed military to reclaim their territory. This proved to be a terrible decision.
The Invaders sent huge amounts of soldiers and spacecraft and absolutely destroyed The Entrigeri forces. They soon conquered the entire outer region of 100232. This defeat for The Entrigeri sent their morale plummeting.
The Invasion of the Inner Areas
[
]
The Entrigeri still had many troops and supplies, with most of them being concentrated in the inner areas. This allowed them to get materials faster, which let them hold off The Invaders for a longer period of time. The Invaders started by destroying key areas which were used to produce war supplies, weapons, spacecraft, and other vehicles. The Entrigeri fiercely defended these areas. Their efforts proved to be successful, as The Invaders only captured 3 key areas while The Entrigeri secured over 17. This allowed them to defend against The Invaders for a relatively long amount of time.
The Invaders kept sending more spacecraft and troops to fight for a long time, and The Entrigeri could not hold off against the invasion much longer. They decided to hatch an escape plan. A large group of Entrigeri gathered in a small space to create a pocket dimension, launch it to a specific spot, and then enter it. Millions of Entrigeri made the perilous journey to the pocket dimension, and many died along the way due to The Invaders.
The Aftermath
[

The Invaders could not access The Entrigeris' pocket dimension, and so gave up trying to pursue them. They assimilated all the remaining Entrigeri in 100232 and conquered it. 8,123,782 Entrigeri went into the pocket dimension, in which they would slowly build their civilization from scratch.
