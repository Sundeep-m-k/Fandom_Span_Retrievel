Microverses
Milliverses
are
archverses
that are contained inside
universes
, making them in class 0. Our universe is actually special due to not containing these, but instead containing
polyverses
(universes with this property are around 1 in 7.5 trillion). Their size is approximately the same as
superclusters
. Since they have a higher amount of energy and are smaller, their composition is similar to early universes, with a higher average temperature and higher density. In the
LNB model
, they are (0, 1, 1), being classified as a pod. However, some milliverses can have really small deviations of physical and geometrical constants (<0.00001 difference), making them (0.1, 1, 1), which is classed by some to be abolutely verse. They are actually very hard to enter, requiring you to go almost 10% the speed of light to break through the barrier.
To see the first milliverse discovered by humans, see
MILI-1

Composition
[
]
Milliverses have
galaxy clusters
and other components of a universe, except at an earlier stage. Milliverses also have a higher amount of background radiation as
protons
,
electrons
, photons and other
elementary particles
.
Collisions
[
]
Milliverses can be in motion, so they can collide with other things.
Sub-Versal
[
]
This is for when milliverses collide with galaxies or stars.
Slow (<0.1% the speed of light)
[
]
When a galaxy approaches a milliverse at a slow pace, it doesn't actually collide with it, due to the barrier repelling it in the opposite direction.
Moderate (0.1-10% the speed of light)
[
]
When a galaxy approaches a milliverse at a moderate speed, its stars bounce off the milliverse individiually, slightly spreading the galaxy apart and deforming it. A lot of stars will also collide with each other in this event.
When a star approaches a milliverse at this speed, it simply bounces off the milliverse because it doesn't have enough energy to make it through the barrier.
Fast (>10% the speed of light)
[
]
When a galaxy or a star approaches a milliverse at a fast speed, it breaks through the milliverse's barrier and enters it, forming a ripple on its barrier.
Versal
[
]
This is for when milliverses collide with other milliverses.
Slow
[
]
The two milliverses are too massive to repel each other completely, so they do a slight collision which creates some small ripples on their barriers.
Moderate
[
]
The two milliverses merge into one, but not completely. The regions of their barriers that are part of the collision start being shared, so things going between the two milliverses still have to cross the barrier.
Fast
[
]
Fast collisions of milliverses are usually very destructive. If they are not aligned, then the two milliverses crash, and the regions of their barriers that were part of the collision are destroyed. This makes a hole in the milliverses, which start spilling out all of their contents, emptying and destroying them after millions of years. If they are aligned, which is very rare, then they merge into one larger milliverse, however some of their contents spill out in the merge.
Barrier
[
]
The barrier of a milliverse is kind of like a bubble, and it is very hard to break through, requiring you to be going aroung 10% the speed of light to do that. Entering / exiting a milliverse causes ripples to form on its barrier that slowly fizzle out. The zones these ripples occur in actually make the barrier easier to go through, making you only need to go 1 to 5% lightspeed. The barrier also exerts a repelling force on the objects that go near it, from both sides.
