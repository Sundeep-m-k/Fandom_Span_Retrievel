The Oncedonverse
[
]
The Oncedonverse
is a universe found at the outer limits of
The Box
.
It is about 300 billion ly in diameter, and about 1 trillion galaxies exist in it.
Dark Energy in the Oncedonverse was controlled to let it reach it's current size without any changes.
The Oncedonverse is currently 6 billion years old, and life has just started to form, but their
Creators
have started to move in, building settlements and sanctuaries to live in.
Theories

Other Oncedonverses
[
]
Currently, it is believed that this is the only Oncedonverse to exist, but some boxes could have undiscovered Oncedonverses, or even multiple ones.
Predecessors
[
]
If there are other Oncedonverses, it could be that the Bots were NOT the creators of the Oncedonverses, and they just tried to find a universe or singularity that was far enough away from the rest of the multiverse to live in, and the creators were a highly-advanced race that created many universes as an experiment.
Convergent Evolution Theory
[
]
It could be that every box with a civilization may evolve to create universes and construct Oncedonverses near their box's edge.
