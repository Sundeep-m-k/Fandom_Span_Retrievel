The
averentroverse
is a negative sized verse that is known for its very vibrant colors, created by the large amounts of
antentroverses
contained inside. The reason for the color is that at the size antentroverses are at reality breaks down, and from a distance, instead of the grey color normally seen on an antentroverse, it becomes shades of bright green, yellow, and purple.
It is extremely hard to escape from an antentroverse into a averentroverse, due to the lack of entropy inside an antentroverse. The only way for this to happen is for a
qsheuf
, its only native lifeform, to come by and consume the antentroverse someone is in. It eventually ejects anything inside the original antentroverse into the averentroverse through its "blowhole". After this, it is impossible to enter another antentroverse. If anyone ejected from the qsheuf had gotten this way starting in a
Sequoiaverse
, they begin to perceive objects normally again.
The averentroverse gets its name from the fact that it has completely average entropy. Thus, things are not too chaotic but also not too dormant.
