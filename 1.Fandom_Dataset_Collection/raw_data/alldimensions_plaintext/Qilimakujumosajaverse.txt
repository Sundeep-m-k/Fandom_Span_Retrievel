Qilimakujumosajaverse is a verse located 3 quadrillion light years away from our universe. It is 80 billion light years big, and it has a completely different physics compared to our universe. Instead of galaxies, it contains giant black holes that emit a lot of colored light.
Because the verse is a 10 dmensional omegasphere, we can't really see what it looks like, but we have some speculations of what it looks like from the inside.

The verse contains giant black holes, but inside those lies a singularity that you can actually stand on which are about the size of the sun. Due to the size of the black holes, only 17 are able to fit. This is where most of the civilizations reside in.
All the light that is emitted by the holes are actually solid The light is made of photonic matter and used by the civilizations to refuel their transportations. Cities are also being built there.
This verse also has 4 fundamental forces: gravity, electro, weak and nuclear forces.
