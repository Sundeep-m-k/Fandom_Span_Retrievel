Ancient Overlord is a “void” where any forms of existence, non existence, anti existence,concepts and everything and non-nothing instantly collapses then dissolves infinite times in a void second while very impossibility of idea of collapse is utterly impossible. Ancient Overlord doesnt depend on any grammar meaning TAO collapses any possible and impossible idea of subjections and including impossibilities and possibilities aswell. This “void” collapses all the timelines and “pre” “present” and “post” yet outside of time aswell. When you enter “its” “void” then you were always and never collapsed and dissolves infinite times in a
void second
. There is no “there is no” because still a thing. Ancient Overlord cannot be transcendended because beyondness is a concept that is always and never collapsed and dissolved.

Absolute Infinite- 10{999}^^^^10{999} DYC
Ancient Overlord is a lot weakened. Concept of Possibilities and Impossibilities emerged, yet still concept of time didn’t emerged.
10{999}^^^^10{999} DYC - 0 DYC
At 0 OYC concept of time born and Ancient Overlord is unknown. Existence was born and new cosmic entities are born.
