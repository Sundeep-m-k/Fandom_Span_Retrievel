Universe filaments
Cletr structures
are large, ring shaped structures comprised of millions of
universe filaments
, formed by them binding from gravity + energy barrier silliness. These structures can only contain universe filaments that contain fewer than 650,000,000 universes. If universe filaments that are too large merge into the cletr structure, they get sent out at 1,520,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000c due to unknown reasons. This is why they differ from
ptur structures.
The first cletr structure was observed in 1981. They are much less stable than ptur structures, lasting only up to 68.4 quintillion years.
