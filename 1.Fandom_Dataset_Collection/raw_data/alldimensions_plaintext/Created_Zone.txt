The Created Zones are very similar to
Deleted Zones
. They are areas that contain some of the best -verses/dimensions on the wiki, which means that the Created Zones include things like the
H̄æwnverse
. They can either be small, which indicate that they are in a Glitchverse, or they can be bigger, which indicate that they are out somewhere in the Infinitearrangeiverse.
Backstory
[
]
It's backstory is the same as from a deleted zone, because alongside a deleted zone, a created zone also gets created.
Size
[
]
Due to the amount of good pages on the wiki, it is nearly impossible to count the size of a Created Zone, so the size will not be explained here. For similar reasons, the dimensionality can't be explained either.
