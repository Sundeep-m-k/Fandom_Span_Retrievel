About
[
]
Ug
is a really tiny ant that lives in a
Protoverse
. Its only relatively interesting feature is that it contains
THE BOX
, despite the latter being clearly larger than a Protoverse, making Ug have a
godlike
status. It's currently housed in the
LUA
lab #74-ALPHA for research.
Behavior
[
]
Ug just eats random
Blueprint Particles
and crawls around the Protoverses it is close to.
Appearance
[
]
It looks like an ant, like a pretty dark pink one to be specific. It also doesn't have mandibles, instead sporting a
human
-like mouth.
It also has 6 legs and antennae, like other ants.
Origins

We don't really know where it comes from, but LUA scientists are still trying to figure it out. They have failed numerous times, though.
