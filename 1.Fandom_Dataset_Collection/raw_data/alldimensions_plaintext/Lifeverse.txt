The Lifeverse
is a
Universe
that has all of its 31.8 billion planets with life like the Earth, but with 3x as much life.
If a planet was hit by an asteroid and all of its life dissapeared, the planet will dissapear, but this is impossible, because all planets, minor planets, moons and asteroids orbits are in a seemingly perfectly circular orbit (0-0.1 of eccentricity).
Also, 89.3% of the life is terrestrial, 10% aquatic, and 0.699% is aerial. 0.001% of it lives in outer space.
