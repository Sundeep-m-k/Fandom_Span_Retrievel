.
Powers & Abilities
[
]
The Collective possesses true omnipotence. It is the culmination of all creators in existence, that existed, that ever will exist and that will possibly exist of fictional works and thus it possesses Transfictional author authority which means he can affect every fictional continuity/work on a true omnipotent scale.
For example, it views the never ending cosmological hierarchy of this
wiki
from a single
universe
to
Boxes
to the
Cells of Greatness
to the
Pentagonal Hexacontahedrons
and even beyond as pure fiction, as a mere aspect of it's being.
It continues to further expand the never ending and infinite cosmology of this wiki, which is just one in the endless totality of an infinite amount of cosmologies and stories it watches over, edits, retcons, discards and creates new beings to govern.
Thus, the Collective is similar to the
Editor
, just on a larger scale.
