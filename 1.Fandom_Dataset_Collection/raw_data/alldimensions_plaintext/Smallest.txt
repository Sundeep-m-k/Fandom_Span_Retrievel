Smallest
If a Smallest could be observed, this is what they would look like.

Smallests
, as their name says, are one of the smallest objects in existence. In fact, they're so small that there is no microscope powerful enough to observe them, but even with that issue we still know that they exist, as small energy waves have been detected branching out of
Montoses
and
Smallers
, which means that they may actually contain another objects.
These are theorized to be so unstable that, if another Smallest touches them, even for 10^-inf Planck Times, it will explode and release a shockwave of around the size of a
Second Realm
, potentially turning into an
Alphasmic
-level threat.
It should be incredibly obvious that no creatures can live here. Their temperature can’t be measured, either.
