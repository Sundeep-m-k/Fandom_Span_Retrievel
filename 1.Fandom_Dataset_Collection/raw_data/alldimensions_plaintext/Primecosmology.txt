Primecosmology
(or
Prime Cosmology
) is the branch of
Hypercosmology
that studies
Barrels
and nothingness within them.
The Barrel Index
[
]
Main article -
The Barrel
The Barrel Index n denotes "freedom of nothingness", where Barrel-0 is an
Outside
, and Barrel-(n+1) has a noticeable increase in freedom compared to Barrel-n which it contains. The biggest n value possible is chosen, and only
structures
that don't exist and are directly/indirectly contained by a Box count.
If a Barrel doesn't directly or indirectly contain the main Outsides, then it is instead compared relative to similar freedom-wise structures in the main Barrel hierarchy. If a structure is somehow less free than an Outside or more free than a Box, then it doesn't have a Barrel Index.
The Barrels are Barrel-1, the
Barrelplexes
are Barrel-2, etc.
