properties that determine the feature of a true multiverse that can merge and become hybrids of properties. This means that a true multiverse can have a fractional number of special properties. 3 special properties are indescribable properties that allow you to contain impossibilities. it is also known that each branch is a timeline with a set of each change with time travel. And they happened quite often.  this tree consists of an abstract material that is completely incomprehensible, but the main property of the tree structure is that it is not physical and represents space and time. btw every timeline contain every true multiverse. why are there so many timelines? there is simply a project that has traveled through time and tried all possible events.
