The
Ring System of Eternity
is an infinite ring system that contains clouds and
Endless Perches
. The endless perches are found randomly across the ring system, and the rings' clouds, when consumed, taste fruity and give the consumer power beyond even that of
Bongus
.
The rings' clouds spin extremely rapidly. Each ring has a ring half the size of that ring and it leads to a point. The point is the core, and it supplies sufficient energy and clouds to keep the rings and civilizations supported. Each ring also has another ring containing it that's twice the size, which makes it a good example of the Berry Paradox.
No joke intended, Berry Paradox is just a name for self containing verses and berries are fruits, and the rings here are made of clouds that have a fruity taste. The civilizations here eat the ring clouds for food, and they need the core's energy to survive in the extreme cold, so you'll usually find the civilizations near the center of the ring system.
