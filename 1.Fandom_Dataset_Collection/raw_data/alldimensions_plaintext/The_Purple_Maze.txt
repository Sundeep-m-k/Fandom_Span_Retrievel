The
Purple Mazes
are the next step in the incomprehensibly large
4th-class
verses
, also being the first type of
colored
maze
of the three
existant
ones
in this class.
Inside of relatively soft calcium shells they're made of lie an infinite amount of
Alternates
, with
purple
moss growing on the calcium. A faint heartbeat can be heard at the center of very few Purple Mazes, and it looks to be a
planet
-sized embryo in an almost never ending developent. These work as the mazes' "cores".
The aforementioned
entities
regularly consume Alternates for fuel, although their mostly feed on air (not only oxygen, literally ALL the air). The rest of these mazes are, indeed, solvable like their counterpart,
the Mazes
. The purple moss found on their surface seems to be very soft and feeds only on the occasional
particles
that lie on them.
Very few embryos have been capable of growning to the point they fully madurate into
godlike
beings made of a similar material their homes, the Purple Mazes, have. This means their local maze loses its core, slowly deteriorating and turning into
nothing
.
