The
Chronoverses
are a naturally made chain of verses, which there are 6 in total.
Each
Chronoverse
has an asigned number
n
{\displaystyle n}
(the first level
Choronverse
has
n
=
1
{\displaystyle n=1}
, second level
n
=
2
{\displaystyle n=2}
, and so on until level 6)
, this will be important later on. There is
only one
Choronverse-
n
{\displaystyle n}
in this entire chain, there are no duplicates.
The
Choronverse-
6
{\displaystyle 6}
, which contains all
Choronverse-
m
{\displaystyle m}
, for
1
≤
m
≤
5
{\displaystyle 1\leq m\leq5}
, was found in a remote part of the
Omniverse
, after the panicked inhabitants of a rogue
Metaverse
reported seeing
strange lights and formations quickly approaching them
, without the ability to stop them from the imminent collision.
A
"rescue mission"
was quickly launched and the threat was eliminated with ease. However, upon closer inspection, the
Choronverse
was found to be
no ordinary verse
.
Interior - Properties
[
]
Each
Choronverse
has basically the same laws and properties. Every single one contains two different types of objects:
polytopes and particles
. Particles are all points with a sphere of influence around them, which allows them to interact with other particles.
The rules and properties have 3 exceptions:
Choronverse-
n
{\displaystyle n}
is an
n
{\displaystyle n}
-dimensional verse.
Choronverse-
n
{\displaystyle n}
only contains objects of
n
{\displaystyle n}
facets.
Choronverse-
n
{\displaystyle n}
itself, has
n
+
1
{\displaystyle n+1}
facets.
Because of the second rule, an object from a
Choronverse-
n
{\displaystyle n}
can not enter into a
Choronverse-
m
{\displaystyle m}
, where
n
≠
m
{\displaystyle n\neq m}
, and vice versa. This rule basically constructs the each Choronverse's barrier itself, with no outside help.
But particles are a different story.
There is a set of particles that each
Choronverse
should contain, but the particles have varying dimensionalities, and as such, only the ones with matching dimensionalities to the
n
{\displaystyle n}
in the
Choronverse-
n
{\displaystyle n}
exist
. Every other particle is
non-existant
, and most non-existant particles of dimensionality
m
{\displaystyle m}
simply find their way to the
Choronverse-
m
{\displaystyle m}
, where they get stuck and remain there.
When two particles of equal dimensionality come into contact, the collision produces nothing, and the two particles change angles by 90° in a relative shared direction
(left - left, right - right, etc)
. However, when two particles of differing dimensionalities collide, they attract the two closest particles to travel on the shortest collision path with each particle. With each new collision of such kind, a new particle is created at random, which will not be attracted into colliding upon impact, as that would cause a continuous loop
(not that loops or paradoxes are impossible to construct through laws)
.
Most of these collision chain reactions don't last long whatsoever. One has to get lucky to witness one that lasts for longer than one / two collisions, but when it happens, it is considered lucky if it ever stops.
This is what happened, when the Metaverse inhabitants looked out and saw a mess of lights and colors heading for them.
