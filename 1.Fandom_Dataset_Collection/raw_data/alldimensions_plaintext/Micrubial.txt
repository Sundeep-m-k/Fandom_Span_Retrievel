An abstract number
Micrubial
is so micro. It is a much smaller counterpart of
Bial
and has so similar properties yet more abstract. They have got a smaller one, called a
Nanobial
at their center and elsewhere.
The sub-xial particles are hard not just because of being abstract, the surface is
almost impossible
to crack.
