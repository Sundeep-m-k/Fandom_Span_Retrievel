Mutant is the Ultimate Cosmic Entity. The keeper of eternity. Ultimate power incarnate. Master of all with dominion over every aspect of combat. Perhaps it came from a world beyond that dimensional rift... No "Fictional" Things can defeat it. Because it Ignores any Nonsense(For example, can defeat real life beings), and Power Disable Effect(From Mutant Presence, this Ignores the "Power Nullification Immunity", Because of Immunity Disable Effect From Mutant Presence.) And also It's Size is Equal to Real Life Computer/Monitor Screen size. Only Being that can defeat Mutant is
「
God
」
.
Because
「
God
」
is not a "Fictional" Being.
The only being to survive Mutant is
Godzilla in Hell
, as they once fought and ended in a tie.
