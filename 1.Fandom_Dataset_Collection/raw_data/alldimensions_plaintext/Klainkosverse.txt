Living in a Klainkosverse would be hard, because they're hyperbolic and non-encludian. Also, you have to ONLY walk on some track-looking structures, and if you don't,

, but unlike the other ones it also contains unknown (and kind of irrelevant) verses for research purpose, along with the usual quantum foam.

God
once used one of these verses as a testing playground for quantum foam, and it was successful. And you would NOT believe what happened next, you know what he did? He donated it to sentient CATS! Yep, cats rule this one verse now!
