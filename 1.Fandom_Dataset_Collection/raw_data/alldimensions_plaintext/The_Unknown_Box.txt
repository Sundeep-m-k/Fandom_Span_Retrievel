The
Unknown Box
is a very large area which contains Broxspace. It is very unknown, as everything which is in it (excluding the Broxspaces) will get deleted 34 minutes after they have traversed outside of the Broxspaces into The Unknown Box. So far, no civilization has managed to escape The Unknown Box or gain any real information about it due to its property.
