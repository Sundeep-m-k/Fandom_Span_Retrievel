The
Tredaverse
rarely enters this state, and it has only been seen twice in all of time, once was when somebody took away his sandals. In this form, he uses his true power, over 100 centillion times more powerful than the
Sortaverse
. He does this in a fit of rage and destroys entire
Asimagoymaverses
. You either have to steal his sandals like mentioned before or hurt one of his friends, as he cannot fully control himself in this form. It takes the
Udekaverse
to control him in this state. Do not anger The
Tredaverse
