The
Berverse
is a large disk floating with other Berverses in the cluster. The Berverse contains universe that resemble the
Compaverse

The disk
[
]
(I will be vague on how the outside rids universe clusters)
The disk is what the Berverse is. The disk is around 5 septillion light years. Some universe clusters are large enough to escape the disk, once escaped the cluster will slowly fade away. We do not know why this happens. Because of this the disk has to make a forcefield to protect universe clusters and the core from being exposed.
The Inside
[
]
Inside the disk lies various universe clusters most of them ranging in size, the biggest one being 4 quintillion light years that cluster is almost about to leave the Berverse, in a few trillion years it would float out and fade away. Inside the inside you can notice that it looks like a fractal with universes floating around. It is also the brightest location in the Berverse due to collisions happening within.
The Universe Clusters

The biggest cluster
Universe clusters make up 77% of the universe the rest is emptiness. Sometimes universes collide causing the surrounding area to be very bright. Collided universes just get bigger and contain more than regular ones. The biggest one is named llh-405-500. llh-405-500 contains hundreds of civilizations all of them being advanced then ones in different universes.
Civilizations
[
]
There are a lot of civilizations in the Berverse at least a few billion all of them being slightly advanced. Only a 20% is hostile and the rest are not. Some of these civilizations are more advanced than others especially like the llh-405-500 civilizations.
