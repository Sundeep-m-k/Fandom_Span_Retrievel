End of Space
is a Xenoverse which contains ALL of space no matter what, but it doesn't even look like space it's just a void. It also contains all extensions of space and pseudospaces. Everything beyond this cannot be considered tangentially related to spacial constructs. Additionally, the end of space acts as both a void and a barrier. The reasons as to why this is is because spacial constructs are often inaccessible to other spacial constructs within it, and the verse itself is mostly void. The reason why it acts as a barrier is pretty simple: it is currently impossible for entities bound by it to leave.
Efforts to exit the end of space have resulted in numerous non catastrophic yet humiliating failures.
There are no non-legal laws known to govern anything beyond the end of space consistently. This may not seem new, but there have been "physical" laws governing certain metaverses and Xeno-Class 1 verses, even though it was incredibly rare.
