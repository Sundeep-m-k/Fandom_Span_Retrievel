Take this with an extreme grain of salt as the nature of the essence of this page both violates and affirms the validation or negation of either argument supporting or denying the claim posed by this entry (and do the same with any instance of value mentioned in this page)
“
"All natures pertaining the actualization of any nature or construct to deny itself the nature and construct of its foundation are limitant in its own mention of its negation. And the ideology of emphasizing its denial only serves to proxy a value subverting the ideal granted upon it; and so would be the antithesis of what goes. To violate all things requires something that is without identification, and cannot be determined by "is," "it," or any other things that serves as a purpose to commodify right or wrong, to give an answer to questions that ultimately serve to bestow upon things a qualitative purpose, motive, or identity, and that only continues the cycle of stagnation in the perception of advancement."

Nature of the Verbality of All Distinguished Systems
[
]
To start off with a very simple and understandable motive to comprehend the later framework of this page, you must understand that there are various topics, ideas, and fields conceived prior to this article that are fundamental to know, including, but not limited to:
Verbal Informality, Universalism, Individualism, Superverbal Distinction, Delineate Constructivism, Abmetricism, Nonsubstantialism, Implicatory Systems, Jurisdictions, and the following prefixes: meta-, pata-, and cata-.
These concepts are paramount to understanding the deep analysis of all objects, properties, and structures mentioned in these sections below. If you do not understand any of the concepts mentioned above, this article will be extremely difficult to comprehend.

"Delimitant of Value as a Synopsis of Inverbality"
is our assumption. We can classify things into logical, proper, strict, etc. thought, to create a system of comparison between them, which can be categorized into qualia like power, size, strength, authority (not the analytical one), and so on. We can and will refer to these properties as "positive connotations." In this wiki, we have entities, beings, concepts, and structures that consist of these positive connotations, and they are ordered by
analytical hierarchies
that serve to measure them. However, the qualitative restrictions are derived from the implied value that is inherent in all these concepts, regardless of the words used to describe it or not. One way to classify these restrictions are through axioms and analyses, some of which will be described later in the article.
