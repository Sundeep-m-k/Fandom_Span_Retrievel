The destructionverse is a verse located somewhere unknown in the outside. This verse is self-aware, and it seeks to destroy everything in its path! Nothing is in it, as it has destroyed all things inside of it except for debris. It was created by
The Destroyer
in order for him to destroy everything in existence. The more it destroys, the more of a chance it has of being able to escape the box and destroy other objects that escaped it. It is also the same size as an omniverse.
