Tuop
is a versentity (actually an entry that is also an entity entry) which constantly creates incredibly small entries and incredibly large entries larger and more powerful than itself through ever complicating, ever inane and absurd and pointless ways. It has no known limit to its creative power, and its intellect is constantly increasing, allowing for even larger and smaller entries. He is both incredibly efficient at doing this and incredibly persistent and very capable of doing so. His scale is unknown, maybe larger than
Giant Shithole
, but also probably smaller than
Giant Shithole.
His reasons for creating so many entries are unknown for now.
Despite the fact we are long beyond continuity at this point, the intellect and thus creative power and thus scale range of the entries tuop produces are still ever increasing through some sort of absolute time.
Tuop may manifest through spacial avatars, mostly sighted in entries he produced.
The spacial avatars in question are apparently godlike beings in their respective entries, unless they are entries >Tuop.
Like everything else at this point, Tuop is creating so many entries that it just can't be explained how many there are and how large they become.
