Beliefs
[
]
Common beliefs of this secret religion have formed recently, such as the idea that the Worm has a secret sibling bent of destroying or taking the worm's glory for itself. They have even formed elaborate backstories and possible explanations as to how this once normal worm achieved Omnipotence.
Made up explanations
[
]
Some of their attempts to explain the Worm's past have no basis in reality or ever happening at all, with a lot of claims made across divisions blurred with truth and legend, or straight up coping mechanisms just to give the religion some real purpose, instead of just being a way to praise a pointlessly omnipotent being.
