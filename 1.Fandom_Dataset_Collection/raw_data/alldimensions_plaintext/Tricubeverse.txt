Structure
[
]
The Tricubeverse is a verse that is a cube. Interestingly, it has two smaller cubes inside of it, making a total of three cubes, hence the name. The two smaller cubes have opposite laws, making them unstable. The main cube is there to help stabilize the small cubes, it has a very interesting verse family.
In some Tricubeverses, the two cubes overlap, making a stable point inside.

Trivia
[
]
It does not contain any verses, so it is its own chain of verses.
The two cubes contain nothing, as they are completely solid and uniform. The materials that the cubes are made of range from ordinary ones like iron or silicon to exotic materials like dark matter to materials that cannot exist in our universe. Therefore, all that they could contain is just any potential verses found in its atoms, which aren't put into account of anything.
