The BUTC is the first Universal Transportation Craft, and the first in the
VTC Chain
.  It’s the slowest in the chain, but it is the first one to break the light barrier. Utilizing warp mechanics and some very cleverly designed gravity drives (which become obsolete once quantum drives are introduced), the BUTC can go much faster than light.
It was first manufactured in the year 2760, and was only a prototype, swiftly being taken over by the AUTC a mere 10 years later. It was used for faster inter-solar system transport, and was at first used for supplies, but was released to the public in 2767. Only 3 years later was the AUTC manufactured, and this one was approved much quicker, making the BUTC obsolete to consumers after only 4 years.
Nowadays, a BUTC is easily accessible, only costing one about 100Ⓖ, but the production cost is only 1Ⓖ. This price discrepancy is simply due to a lack of both supply and demand, however it
still
remains the cheapest VTC on the market to this day.
The Interior of a BUTC is incredibly simple. It can turn in 3 dimensions, and has a speed lever. It has artificial gravity, produced by spinning the interior in the first prototype, but nowadays it is much cheaper to just use artificial gravity generators instead. The BUTC has a capacity of 20, due to not much being taken up by controls. Faster and larger derivatives of the BUTC have been made, and these are still used for short-range solar system public transport in relatively rural areas.
Some users of the BUTC may opt to have a control bot that plots courses, because the BUTC actually does not have this feature, which means you have to slow down about 4 light-days away from your destination to see where you’re going. This is also very cheap, at only 20 Ⓖ.
There's also the Universal Transportation Kraft, a Kraft product which is a worse version of the UTC. It costs about 20Ⓖ, and has no piloting systems. You must manually input coordinates for it to travel to, which it will do so. You must also observe all of the stars and other objects on the straight path there, calculating everything yourself to come up with your own trajectory. You can then input the trajectory to the device, which it will follow very poorly. It breaks a lot, and they went out of production just 4 years after their introduction.

The Advanced Universal Transportation Craft, or the AUTC, is the next UTC, after the BUTC. Like I said in the BUTC’s section, the AUTC was first manufactured in 2770, and was accessible to the public in 2771. It was approved much quicker, because at first the Galactic Council had to decide whether letting a bunch of people run around with hyperfast vehicles was a good idea.
The AUTC made the BUTC obsolete after 4 years. At first, it went for ridiculous prices such as 10,000Ⓖ, but they have now reduced to a very reasonable 180Ⓖ. Unlike the BUTC, demand still exists for this craft. Some features of the AUTC is that it has a course plotting system and many more controls. The airtight seals are also tighter, and there is a Maintenance hatch that when USED, can extend the lifespan of an AUTC from only about 4 years to 48 years.
With many other features, demand still exists. Due to being an affordable craft and that the average person need not travel intergalactic distances every day, this is a great form of travel in modern life. The Galactic Government had released a cheaper alternative, the CAUTC, but not that many people bought it. The CAUTC has since been discontinued.
The AUTC still uses gravity drives. Now about the interior. There are many more controls, and as such less space. To combat this, the AUTC is now 6x6x6, instead of 5x5x5, like the BUTC. This adds over 91m

of space to the AUTC, which nobody actually… really… uses.
The next craft, the EUTC, does actually use something other than gravity drives. It is a hybrid between gravity drives and warp drives, but it is actually neither. It was discovered by Feeshimius Lè Trout.
The AUTC has had several revisions since then. The image was of the fisrt prototype, but AUTCs today can warp up to 6 million c, which is about 0.19 ly/s.
Certain variations of the AUTC, which are considered to be of slightly poorer quality, but still vastly superior to the BUTC, are given out for free to citizens by certain, more well developed states.

The Elite Universal Transportation Craft, spelled ‘EUTC’ and pronounced “yootz” is an extemely revolutionaly step in drive mechanics. It completely owes its existence to the Le Trout Drive, which is based on space time.
Its inventor, Le Trout, is revered as a hero and paved the way for future quantum drives to come. Unlike the AUTC, the EUTC was released over 40 years after the AUTC, and was first manufactured in 2816. During that time, the AUTC went through some major revisions to become faster and better, but the discovery of the EUTC shocked the galaxy.
The EUTC was, and still is, very expensive however. Going for over 550Ⓖ, the EUTC is still accessible to middle class Universe citizens , but it isn’t exactly cheap for them either. Its maintenance hatch is useless now, as maintenance is automated. And, the EUTC can go up to 270 billion c, or over 8570 ly/s.
The EUTC Deluxe (Or EUTC III, more formally), the latest model of EUTC (before UUTC was introduced), can go up to 19 trillion c!!
The EUTC is still the same size as the AUTC. This is because Le Trout drives were optimised for sizes like the AUTC, so going overboard with size wasn’t really logical. Now, let’s talk some more features. The EUTC has an incredibly intelligent control system, and comes with furniture, a bathroom and garbage disposal. There’s also WarpFi!
The EUTC, unlike the other drives, used antimatter as fuel. Antimatter was, however, very common in those days. The EUTC, for this reason, also had a high risk of exploding, and so users had to be given clearance to use the EUTC.
the real photo was extracted from the wrecked ship . It is not known how this is possible, but SOMETHING killed them.  This unknown case was investigated for a very long time and it turned out that these were dark creatures of their other xenoverse. Very rare. For that photo obtained.

The UUTC, not pronounced “yootz.”
Speed
Cruising: 231 trillion c, Max Warp: 144 quadrillion c, but can go over 439 quadrillion in an emergency. The UUTC Consumer Edition is 60-90x slower.
Size
Commercial: 288m by 127m

Faster than
EUTC
The UUTC (Ultimate Universal Transportation Craft), is substantially larger than the others. This was due to the fact that the UUTC was only meant for commercial uses. Due to the inefficiency of antimatter as fuel, the UUTC uses enriched deuterium as fuel. The UUTC costs over 25,000Ⓖ. As well as this, the UUTC contains multiple production facilities for fuel as well as other things. It also contains a garbage recycling facility, and using hydrogen gas from the void, it can generate extra deuterium or plain hydrogen gas in an emergency
The UUTC also has a gigantic fuel storage - enough to go about 18% of the way to the edge of the
Universe
. The UUTC is the first to use quantum drives as well, which is what made the UUTC so efficient. Consumer editions have been released, though not by the Galactic Government. These are about 1000m
3
, and go about 60-90x slower than a UUTC and certainly not as far, but they are priced at only 1000Ⓖ.
The UUTC usually holds a crew of about 1000, which is often needed, as the ship is so vast. At technology stages like when the UUTC was released, thousands of autobots weren’t that economical. However, being hired aboard the UUTC was, and still is (for Kardashev <5 at least), a luxury.
The UUTC can warp at around 4 million ly per second. This means the UUTC can warp to distant galaxies billions of ly away in mere hours. The UUTC would also be able to reach the edge of the observable Universe in 3.19 hours. So, plenty of time to catch up on
Star Trek
.
There are many variations of the UUTC which are very similar to passenger trains, having the same purpose and working the same way, just going on a predetermined route across their universe, going to many galaxies. The galaxies they then travel to have their own, smaller transport systems.
