are even more microscopical versions of the
Smallesters
. Smallestests are located inside the centers of the formers, and like them they're also ridiculously unstable and can create explosions larger than their local
Omniplasms
, though for this to happen there needs to be a lot of Smallestests colliding with eachother about ω times per
voidsecond
. Required amount of Smallestests for the reaction can vary from ω to ℵ1, and if even more of them are within the area the explosion may get worse.
Another way for a Smallestest to explode is if it starts bouncing inside of its local Smallester at about Ω times per second, though the generated explosion will obviously be smaller due to being caused by only one Smallestest. This explosion is roughly the size of a
Fricknia
, similar in strenght to the potential explosion a Smallester can cause if triggered.
Since adding even more "ers" or "est" terminations on the word "small" could be overwhelming (example: "Smallestester" or "Smallestestest" is kinda overwhelming), this marks the end of the "Small" chain, the next particles being known as
Tiniests
instead.
