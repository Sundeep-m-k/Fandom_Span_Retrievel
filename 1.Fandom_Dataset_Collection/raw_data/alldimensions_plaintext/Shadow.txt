The
Shadow
(Yeb Prow'dodsh in the
Pencil Language
) is a creation of
Vood'Em
before he had been trapped in a
BEYOND HELL
. It is a ginormous creature living underneath its local
Table
. It eats the realities underneath it for food. The Shadow can eat almost anything, even the very tough materials, like
Primordium Delta
. The Shadow can not be seen in the
visible spectrum
. It must be seen using infrared cameras. If anything touches the Shadow, they will begin to corrode and melt in a dark, burning acid puddle. This is why the Shadow is so powerful. When the Shadow runs out of realities to eat, it will eat its own Table.
On one occasion, a hole appeared in the Shadow's local Table. The entity was underneath eating its Table, and many creatures saw the terrifying creature beneath. A few hundred undecillion realities, voids, and particles fell into the hole and got eaten by the Shadow. Many omnipotent gods tried to stop it. They were successful, but many got eaten. Its Table got eventually fixed and reinforced with wood from the
oak tree
.
