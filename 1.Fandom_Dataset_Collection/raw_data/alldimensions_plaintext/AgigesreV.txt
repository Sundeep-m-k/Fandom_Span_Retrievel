AgigesreV
is a large cube with several holes positioned all over the surface, these holes are
sAgemesreV
, any holes created in AgigesreV grow uncontrollably large until they are as big as a AgemesreV, at which point they begin to become an AgemesreV. This process takes about an hour to be completed and spots near the hole will begin spewing red liquid. When the red liquid touches something that is not an AgemesreV, it forms into bubbles that do not react with normal matter, but destroy any matter inside of them when they pop, which they do after existing for 40,300,000,000 seconds (1,277 years)
On the surface of the AgigesreV, there are occasionally forests that have power trees in them, these power trees grow power leaves and golden fruit. When a power leaf is devoured or absorbed, the being that devoured the leaf gains a lot of power, but if you eat too many of them Melico might send one of their servants to kill you. Golden fruits grow on power trees here and are extremely rare and almost invincible. Golden fruits are very tasty but you can only taste them if you have 3 times as much power as
The Primordial
, because that is how much power you would have to have in order to bite through the skin. The golden fruits contain power seeds which can grow power trees or be eaten by birds, which afterwards will gain infinite power.
There are a species of birds known as Fliers that come to roost and feast on the surface of the AgigesreV, they have the amount of power that a normal bird has until they consume a power leaf or seed, in which case they gain the ability to fly throughout the greatest borger!
