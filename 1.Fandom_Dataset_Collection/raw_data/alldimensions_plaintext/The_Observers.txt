About
[
]
The
Observers
are a group of
entities
that reside outside of everything, just like the
Seeker
. They do not interact with other
verses
,
structures
, lifeforms, or other things in the slightest unless provoked, and just observe what several
Alphasms
and all higher
gods
have created over the countless eternities, hence their name.
This technically means that all gods cannot kill the Observers, due to the latters being beyond Alphasms and all higher gods' imaginary worlds, thus not letting them reach then.

The Observers, in order to observe everything, live in a very strange, very abstract verse simply known as the "Observerse".
Movement
[
]
It exists in every spatial and time dimension, meaning that it can successfully warp around everything, allowing the Observers to view everything from afar.
This does not necessarily mean that the Observerse is the "biggest verse" though, due to it
just
warping around everything, which does not determine its size in its slightest.
Replacement
[
]
Even though just one Observer is enough to watch over everything, multiple Observers live within the Observerse just in case one Observer suddenly disappears. Still, this precaution is completely unneeded and useless.
Powers
[
]
Even though an Observer is usually very docile and peaceful, they can become deadly when provoked. This has never happened before due to an Observer never even being contacted by normal
civilizations
and most gods, but estimates place an Observer's power at being beyond omnipotent.
Paradoxes
[
]
The Observers, since they observe "everything", must also observe themselves. This is done by each Observer infinitely warping into itself while also warping all the way around everything, allowing it to observe "everything".
