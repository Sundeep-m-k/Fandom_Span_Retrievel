Nailsverses
are special verses which are present on
Fingersverses
and
Toesverses
.
Nailsverses are usually semi-transparent, and grow at a consistent rate on a
Fingersverse
or
Toesverse
. This growth can continue indefinitely, and usually have parts of them cut off at a regular basis to avoid them from growing too long.
Nailsverses have the strange property to only grow in one general direction, and do not expand from all directions, like most verses do. They will start to curl up and break if they grow too long.
Nailsverses, if sharp enough and in the right shape, can puncture very deep holes in verses.
