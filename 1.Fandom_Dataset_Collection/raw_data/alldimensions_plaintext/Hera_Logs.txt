Explorers: One, Two, Three, Four, Bunkey
Log #1 (September 2nd): Beginnings
[

Alright, uhm, we landed alright. One here (That's not our real names. Just codenames), so uhh yeah. This moon is quite pretty actually, pretty sad Five is sick. She would've loved this. Now we got the replacement guy and he's a fucking prick. Fuck you, Bunkey. Anyways, we landed here on the coast. Looks dim as fuck if i do say so myself, can barely see the ground. Apparently we're going to need to set up a pressurized little base, a rover and a geothermal energy plant.
Log #2 (September 3rd): The Base

Damn, Planet Nine looks pretty beautiful in the sky. The first thing we did was setting up the geothermal energy planet. It took, like, 6 hours, but we're not in a rush. We now should have plenty of energy to power a base and a bajillion lamps. Did i tell you this moon is dark as fuck?
Alright, base set up. Two and Three went explore throughout the mountains, i sure hope they don't get.. LOST..!!! Okay okay i'll stop. Bunkey didn't do shit on building the energy plant OR the base, that fucking asshole. Anyways, the base got a few good ol features, like artificial gravity, oxygen sequestration for infinite air and pressurized chambers so we don't need the stupid fucking suits all the time.
Log #3 (September 4th): Storm

The atmosphere reader picked up a storm in our area, so we just stayed in base. Turns out, yep, there was a storm all right. The mountain near our base started rumbling and an avalanche of frozen sulphur dioxide began, and you know the best part? Bunkey, the stupid arrogant asshole he is, stayed outside and got fucking crushed to death by a boulder. Celebration time! Oh yeah i recorded the avalanche too.

Log #4 (September 5th): Exploration

Alright, so we just set up the rover. We went to see the mountains, valleys, plains, other stuff, way cooler without that dumbass Bunkey. I think Two, Three and Four did a funeral for him while I was asleep, though i can't understand why they would care about him that bad. We also took a bath in the sulphur dioxide oceans with our spacesuits on. Yeah.
