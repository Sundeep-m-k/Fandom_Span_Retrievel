The TENO is a mysterious creature. It is oddly disgusting, and it looks odd. The dots are its eyes and the long lines are its "arms". It only eats certain verses. Small verses. Because it's not that big in size. The
Ulturamainen
and the
Ulturaens
don't even know if it exists or not. It roams around by swimming like a fish with its long arms through space. Its speed is 750/ly. per hour. The only
Ulturaen
that saw this was the second. It always stands in a weird position. The only this monster does when its full is well. Nothing.
this shit fucking sucks why did i make this.
