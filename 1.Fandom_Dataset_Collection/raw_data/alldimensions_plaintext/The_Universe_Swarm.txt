Average Universe Swarm is slighty smaller, though.
An
Universe Swarm
is an infinite collection of
universes
and sometimes
multiverses
but became too erratic and split off.
In our local Swarm, those verses were originally contained by the
Primordialverse
before what was already mentioned happened. These clumps of universes eventually covered the entire Primordialverse and some even merged due to their close proximity, and some merged so much that they became classified as multiverses. Even if it weren't for the barrier across the Primordialverse making it very difficult to traverse in and out through, the huge amount of clustered universes block almost all entrances.
Our Universe Swarm is larger than the average one thanks to the Primordialverse's incident, though the size difference is almost impossible to notice. Besides, Universe Swarm's sizes vary greatly so ours isnt even the largest nor that special.
