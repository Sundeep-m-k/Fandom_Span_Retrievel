E? is a high-dimensional verse entity with three different zones. Each zone is has different laws of physics, but they are all part of the same verse. These zones, however, are just voids.

Outline
[
]
There is a thin outline around the three zones of E?. These outlines are made of a substance called abstract material, which is the most "null" solid possible, with no feeling, temperature, and no "real material", being basically THE material.
The outline has no movement in relation to the voids because it is abstract material, so the void shapes never change. Abstract material cannot physically topologically change.
The outline, however, does not block anything from entering or exiting E?, since abstract material doesn't have physical interactions, it only interacts with "holes", because holes don't exist, and rely on other objects to be "holes".
Objects in this abstract material do not stop the abstract material from being abstract material. The abstract material will not physically contain the object since it doesn't interact with real matter, since it is abstract.
Void properties
[
]
While these voids are completely nothing, they still have an existence of their own even though they contain nonexistence. This means, as a noun, they are not physical but they aren't nonphysical, as they are somewhere in between. These voids have nothing, but since they are contained by abstract material, they still might not even depend on those entities' existence.
Zones
[
]
There are three void zones in between this abstract material, each having their own laws of physics. While they are voids and have different physics laws, they are completely separated from outside reality, since the abstract material is preventing that, and these zones are contained.
Zone 1
[
]
Zone 1 is the dot in the question mark. It is the smallest of the three zones, and it doesn't have any gravity. This zone will remove the properties of any matter that goes into it, including the cells of living things, so going into this zone is not advised as you will just die. Since there is no gravity, anything put into this zone is usually never gotten back, so there are a lot of random things that don't have any properties in them.
Zone 2
[
]
Zone 2 is the upper part of the question mark and it is mostly harmless, but there is a very weak force that drags everything to the bottom of the zone. This force isn't categorized, it is just completely neutral force that moves things. However, if anything gets in contact with the bottom of the zone, it will completely disappear, since there is a matter eraser down there. Therefore, anything inside this verse is being slowly pushed towards complete deletion of all of it. If something starts at the top of this zone, it will take around 10^10^100000 years to get to the bottom, so there's not much to worry about unless you are very close to it, and you can't see it since it's invisible.
Zone 3

Zone 3 is the main zone of E?, as it is the E. This zone somehow manages to reduce the dimensionality of objects down to whichever lonespace that object is in. This zone has an infinite number of lonespaces, all of which are unindicated and randomly spread across the zone, so it is quite the decision to go into this zone. However, if matter goes into a lonespace, it's dimensionality will instantly change to the dimensionality of that lonespace. Each lonepsace's dimensionality is randomly assigned, so it is unpredictable which dimensionality the matter will change into. Smaller dimensionalities for lonespaces are much more common, but some rare lonespaces go extremely high in their dimensionality so going in is a risk.
