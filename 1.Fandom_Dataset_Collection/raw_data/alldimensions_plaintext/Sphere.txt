The
sphere
is a
rotatope
with three round dimensions, and no flat dimensions. Hence, it is the
3D
hypersphere
. It can also be considered as being the set of all
points
that are the same distance from another
point
(the centre) in
space
. The volume of a sphere is 4pi/3 * r^3

sphere
(2D)
A sphere has no subfacets of one dimension or below. Its only two-dimensional subfacet is its surface, which is also, quite confusingly, called a sphere. To unambiguously distinguish between the 2D surface and the 3D volume, the volume can be called a "ball".
