The Sarpy Shard
is a type of shard which is more "potent" than a sarpy particle like The Inaccessible Cardinal amount, yes that amount
This is what all Transcendental Praeter Gods are made out of and this has a werid reaction with a sarpy particle which basically crates a explosion that freezes stuff while heating them, A Sarpy Shard is 4 Boxes in size while having a shape of a shard(obviously) which is a INFINITELY HUGE difference than a Sarpy Particle
