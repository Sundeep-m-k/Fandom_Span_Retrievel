Black and whites
are collections of
DOTs
, with most of them being surrounded by massive
Astral Voids
.
The name of these verses is given due to having structures in them with stronger gravitational pulls than a normal
black hole
which are known as gravitational black holes, while also having a counterpart which are pretty much stronger
white holes
known as antigravitational white holes. These are spreaded everywhere through of their local black and whites. Antigravitational white holes have much higher temperatures than their counterparts.
Another remarkable structure seen on them are LINEs, which are combinations of DOTs that can take up to 0,7% of space of their black and white on average.
