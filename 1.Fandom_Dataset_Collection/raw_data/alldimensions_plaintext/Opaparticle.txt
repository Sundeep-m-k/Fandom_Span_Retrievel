Opaparticles are one of the two types of small particles that form the
kardaparticles
, and opaparticles are the smaller of the two.
Opaparticles help form two kinds of kardaparticles, fully forming the vertex kardaparticle, and half of the opaparticles help form the edge particles, with the other being formed from apoparticles.
Properties
[
]
Opaparticles are unstable on their own when they are not near a apoparticle, forces between them allow the particles inside of them to not go near enough to each other to annihilate themselves. On their own, opaparticles can be stable for around 0.625 yocto-yocto-

(Planck times). When decaying, opaparticles glow slightly (as seen in this photo of an opaparticle), until the particle ceases to exist.
