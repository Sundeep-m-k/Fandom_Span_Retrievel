Why the name?
[
]

Life
[
]
Life in Petultimateverses is characterized by advanced technological civilizations harnessing the power of
Rainbow stars
. The stars emit radiant energy, which fuels both societal progress and biological adaptations. Living beings can traverse multiple dimensions, interacting with parallel versions of themselves and their surroundings. The presence of the
Star God
influences the spiritual and metaphysical aspects of life, where rituals and beliefs are centered around the stars' cycles and colors. Life is dynamic, with fluid physical laws, allowing entities to manipulate time, space, and energy, shaping their realities in extraordinary ways.
Planets
[
]
Petultimateverses have tons of rogue rocky planets with life on them which travel around the Rainbow Stars, meaning everything on these verses is full of life.
