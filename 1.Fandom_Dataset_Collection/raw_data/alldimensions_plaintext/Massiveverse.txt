The
Massiverses
, more formally known as the
Massiveverses
are huge complexes of
Bigverses
that all share similar laws. Their name is given simply due to being larger than the Bigverses.
Structure
[
]
Massiverses have very messy insides due to there being no central point of gravity to a Massiverse. Bigverses inside the Massiverse usually collide and fly around, with many accidents happening from this. Some of the Bigverses inside a Massiverse are so utterly shredded and destroyed that they do not even resemble a verse anymore.
Of course the collisions can make the Bigverses merge, and there have been recorded instances of a Bigverse eventually turning into a Massiverse. For obvious reasons, the bigger and more dense Massiverses are the ones where an incident like this happens more frequently, yet it still takes a long time to happen unless the entire Massiverse crumbled and got absorbed by its contained Bigverses.
