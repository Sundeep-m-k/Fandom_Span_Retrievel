The
Blox
is one of the biggest verses as of today and contains the
Infinite Colors
. It was formed way before time appeared and will be alive for infinite time fractals. In The Blox, infinities act strange as if they act like finite numbers. So far infinity here is 1, and the Large Veblen Ordinal is 4.
Since The Blox is beyond The Infinite Colors, it has no light meaning no light absolutely whatever. No entity can see it except
Transcendent Omni-Gods
or higher class. The Blox is in fact so dark, so invisible that you can't even think about it. It is beyond what we understand darkness and light is. The image seen on the infobox is how it could look like if it was visible.
The Blox is not the biggest. There are mysterious objects even more invisible beyond The Blox. Only 1 being has been able to travel to them.
