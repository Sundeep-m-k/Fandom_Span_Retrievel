The Idea Space
is the space separate from the Physical Space representing abstract ideas and concepts. This space is a hugely-multidimensional type reality/dimension satisfying constant linear progression of time and an unknown (maximum
40
4896, possibly larger) amount of directions. These directions are somewhat different from dimensions within physical space in that they represent "idea" directions rather than "spacial" directions.
The amount of directions are not constant within the idea space and can range from 2 to the largest: 4896. For example, one area can have a maximum of say, 20 directions, while another area can have 70 directions. 1D vectors conveying features can be converted into idea space and plotted into distinct areas. Specifically, a direction usually corresponds to a general feature of it's area, and can vary between areas. Research has shown that human-dominated areas are located near 1D vectors of length 62-67.
Physical objects are unable to access this space, however, human minds are capable of creating ideas and providing idea transmission. It's important to note that this Idea Space does not contain every possible idea, and as such, many ideas are rapidly being spontaneously generated and destroyed.

Creation of Ideas
[
]
The vast majority of ideas within this space are randomly generated, and thus satisfy
Cosmic
property. Many ideas are destroyed instantly upon creation due to contradictory or paradoxical internals from randomized initialization. Almost all of these ideas are (fortunately) harmless and do not affect other ideas, as this requires strong mutual agreement. Some ideas may be generated via other ideas (such as self-replicating predatory ideas) or by sentient physical beings (although these ideas are not cosmic).
Idea Complexes
[
]
The individual ideas within this space are quite simple, only capable of corresponding to a specific and simple concept, rather than a general one. More general and complex concepts require idea complexes. Each individual concept within a complex represents simple and specific concepts which will then combine into a general abstract idea via hierarchies. For example, an idea complex may contain subsystems which are responsible for a simpler idea. Subsystems may connect to other systems via the "summation" of containing concepts, rather than each individual concept connecting to every other. Such a large amount of connections result in a higher chance of natural "mutations".
A mutual agreement are ideas which have a third connective concept: A third concept linking two different concepts as it's main internal structure. Concepts can be either randomly generated or produced via other concepts. Mutual agreements are the basic building blocks of idea structures or complexes. An idea complex is formed when there are at least 500 linked concepts in the structure with every concept connecting to at least 4% of all other concepts. Each conceptual connection must also be significantly meaningful and must result in emergent behavior.
Lifeforms
[
]
The existence of expressive and dynamic concept systems have allowed for the emergence of phenomena similar to a natural ecosystem with biotic and abiotic physical matter. Concept complexes within this space have complex predator-prey relationships and food webs. Kinetic "organisms" have been observed "feeding" on stationary "plants".
The most common form of feeding occurs via a process known as "appendage". The predator complex attempts to insert itself by locating specific complexes determined by the encoding of it's own. Essentially, information about which prey complexes are edible is encoded into the complex. Once a prey complex is chosen to be consumed, the predator inserts it's semantic information into the prey concept along with a "kill" concept, targeting key aggressive prey concepts and annihilating them. After these prey complexes are destroyed, the other concepts latch onto the main newly forming copy of the predator complex and are "tricked" into believing that it is the prey concept. As a result, these prey concepts latch on and provide the predator complex "nutrition", allowing it to quickly develop into a copy of the predator complex.
This process results in a predator complex replacing it's prey complexes with copies of itself, which has led to the name "appendage". It should be kept in mind that most predator complexes can only target very specific types of prey as most complexes can vary widely in structure.
There are many other different "lifeforms". One notable concept "species" is extremely robust, capable of surviving many types of conceptual attacks and even manipulation. Research into it's workings have not yielded a reliable conclusion.
In general, the "ecosystem" in which these concepts are contained are extremely hostile. Most "species" are solitary in nature and highly aggressive, and as such, requires adaptations for any chance of survival. Fortunately, these ecosystem concepts are quite different from regular "human-comprehensible" concepts such as "apple" or "star".
Due to this, the vast majority of human thoughts or possible thoughts have remained unaffected by these ecosystems.
Determining Idea Complexes
[
]
Most ideas within this space are non-human comprehensible. Due to this, determining features/behaviors present within an idea complex is impossible. However, approximations or simplifications of idea complexes can be created, as shown in AZTIC. The first phase of Operation AZTIC was completed in 8658 by our organization, creating a recursive quantum computer with at least 500 recursive qubits. The creation of these computers required mutual interaction via both Idea and Physical Space, and in this case, a recursive fractal and quantum computer.
This greatly increased the computational power of our computers to over 2^^500 flops, allowing for the development of extremely large AI systems. We uploaded and amplified simulations of human brains to create an extremely intelligent AI system which could easily deduce the structure and function of individual concepts within a complex. The simulations, however, are 98.9% accurate, so some caution must be taken when determining precise function of a complex. Improvements to the AI system are still commencing.
Other common structures
[
]
Other notable structures are:
-
Black Boxes
(Infohazardous idea complexes which aggressively feed on weaker ideas. Most form extremely complex structures and can easily dominate and replace all human thoughts.)
-
Paradoxical Death Concepts
(An idea or idea complex which forms a paradox and then attaches to a host concept, killing it. These ideas have been determined as "abiotic")
-
Constant Complexes
(Complexes which are extremely resilient to attacks and usually remain constant.)
-
Physical-related Concepts
(Concepts which relate to the physical world. For example, the abstract idea of "apple tree" or "star")
-
Adaptive Concepts
(Concepts which are capable of reactive or random positive adaptation. Most biotic lifeforms and Black Boxes are adaptive concepts.)
