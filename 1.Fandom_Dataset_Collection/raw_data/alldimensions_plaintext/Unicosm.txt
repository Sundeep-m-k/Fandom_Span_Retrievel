A
Unicosm
is a
verse
which is smaller than a
Universe
. These verses are found orbiting universes, like a
moon
orbiting a
planet
. A universe can have lots of unicosms orbiting it, and there is an approximately 10% chance that any given universe has atleast 1 unicosm orbiting it. Unicosms orbit Universes at a distance of 100 - 10,000 Gly
(0.1 - 10 Tly)
. The
multiversal
equivalent to a Unicosm is a
Multicosm
.
The universe with the largest amount of Unicosms orbiting it known is
UNI-53350
with 139 Unicosms.
Structure
[
]
Unicosms structurally are very similar to their parent universes, since they were made from the same matter. This means that unicosms near us will have
galaxies
, planets, etc.
Unicosm Locations

UNC-2, UNC-3 and UNC-4 orbiting UNI-382
UNC-5 orbiting UNI-6122
UNC-6 and UNC-7 orbiting UNI-512
Formation
[
]
Unicosms are formed when a
big bang
creates a universe but leaves some of the bang's remnants outside of the newly-formed universe. These remnants coalesce into a smaller big bang, forming an unstable unicosm, or more if there are enough remnants. Sometimes, the unstability causes the new unicosm(s) to instantly crash into the parent universe.
