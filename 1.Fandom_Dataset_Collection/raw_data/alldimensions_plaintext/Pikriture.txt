The Pikriture is a creature that looks like a pi. It has a lot of things that look like pi. Its appearance looks like pi, because it is some kind of line supported by two lines. It was named Pikriture because it looks like pi, it created
Pi-verse
and is a creature, so separating should be Pi+creature. Because of the fact that the creature wasn't inspired by pi, it's size and age aren't pi or something really related, it just looks like pi. It has a glow because it has so much energy stored.
