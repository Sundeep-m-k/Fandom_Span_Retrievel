Yèdè Òsz
[
]
Yèdè Òsz
(God of Simplicity) causes the space and physics around it to become simpler. Very close verses are usually destroyed, while farther verses end up with no galaxies, stars, planets or life.
Yèdè Pyeç
[
]
Yèdè Pyeç
(God of Chaos) causes the space and physics around it to become chaotic or fractal-like. Just like with Yèdè Òsz, very close verses are usually destroyed, while farther verses end up with no galaxies, stars, planets or life.
Yèdè Ṿes
[
]
Yèdè Ṿes
(God of Neutrality) acts as a balance, reversing the effects of the two other entities. It does not restore the verses they destroyed, only desimplifying or decomplexifying the space and physics.
The other entities have tried to destroy it, but Yèdè Ṿes is much more agile than them, always being able to dodge their attacks.
Collisions
[
]
About every 50 years, Yèdè Òsz and Yèdè Pyeç collide, likely in an attempt to destroy each other. This results in a "crater" that destroys all the space that is 100 Ply from it, and simplify/complexify the space 1 Ely from it, depending on which of the entities the space is closer to. This triggers Yèdè Ṿes, which goes to the crater to reverse the collision.
