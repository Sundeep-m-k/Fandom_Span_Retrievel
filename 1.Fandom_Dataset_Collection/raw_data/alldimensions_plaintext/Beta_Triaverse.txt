Beta Triaverse
[
]
The Beta version is the Beta version of the Triaverse. This version was made 2 billion years before the alpha version. The beta version doesn't contain much it can only contain small objects and its coding in the core. Every update the storage can be decreased and increased entities can be added along with galaxies and stars. It was never upgraded to have a storage below 5 gigabytes, but it was granted 5 terabytes in later versions.
Storage
[
]
over the many updates and versions there has been many updates concerning storage. The more storage it is granted the more stars and galaxies it can hold.
The coding
[
]
The coding can be located in the core. In the core you need a code to access. Once accessed the core is made up of code once examined up-close you can notice that there are strings of code in massive clusters. If a glitch ever happens the core will lock, you out until the glitch is patched. In older versions (Still in beta) when a glitch happen the core won't lock you out instead the glitch will spread across the Triaverse, deleting code or corrupting the code.
Life
[

Since it inst in full release it can only hold simple organisms. These organisms do not appear on planets because the beta Triaverse can't hold them due to its storage. These organisms are like the ones on Earth, instead of being on Earth they only exist in space.They have adapted over the updates.
