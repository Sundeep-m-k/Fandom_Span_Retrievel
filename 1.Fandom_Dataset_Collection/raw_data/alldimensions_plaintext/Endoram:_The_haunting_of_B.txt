Endoram killing Icantedit
so i went to tell Morshu about this... we got the lampoil, rope, and bombs to fight Icantedit, but then we saw him right away... ICANTEDIT! i did not know what to do! But Morshu had gotten it... (almost)
When Morshu was about to die,
i was filled with anger, rage, agony, pain. Why would Icantedit do this? I never did anything to him... Why Icantedit, WHY!? i- i cant feel a- anything anym-m more... My friends, my family, talking tom, my dog, i was not ready to lose them... i- i could not give up but i cant do it. Icantedit h- he is t- to powerfull- Bu- But i CANT
GIVE UP!

As I take Morshu on my hands, I dig him a grave and say goodbye... As I lay the lampoil, rope, bombs on his chest, I say a final goodbye to Morshu... Now its time to kill B...
''Hello there traveler! I am the shopkeeper, you need somethin'?'' ''Well I'm trying to defeat B...'' ''Well since you are trying to defeat B, i will give you my trusty sword!'' ''Look now, I don't need that big old sword. You can keep it.'' ''What do you mean? I don't use this sword anymore, I used to use it when I was like you!'' ''Alright, that sword will REALLY come in handy. But I should give you mone-'' ''Come on boy! You don't even need to pay!'' ''Oh, thank you so much! With this sword i could defeat B!'' ''Now, you can buy my stuff. And also that sword has Sharpness 5, and Unbreakable 50!'' ''Goodbye shopkeeper!'' ''Goodbye boy! But before you go, you should be carefull...''
