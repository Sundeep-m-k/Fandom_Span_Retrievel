The False End-All-Be-All
The Disc
is a metadimensional
circle
that loops the hierarchy from the
Protoverse
all the way to
Infinity and Beyond
, such that the hierarchy from the Protoverse to IaB is represented on the edge of the circle, with your progression through it being represented by rotating around the circle clockwise. Once you reach a point in the circle, you'll end up back where you were.
There is a cult verse in The Disc called
The False End-All-Be-All
, making you believe there is a loop. However, this is confirmed to be false. Stated by
Alphasm
, the only way to escape The Disc is to progress in the hierarchy such that on the circle's edge, you'd be moving in the 2nd dimension. If you were going beyond IaB normally, you aren't shrinking, just entering a much larger iteration of the Protoverse.
Anything that's beyond the power of the
Bongus
after the first loop is called an
Ömë-Töpö Mägö
.
