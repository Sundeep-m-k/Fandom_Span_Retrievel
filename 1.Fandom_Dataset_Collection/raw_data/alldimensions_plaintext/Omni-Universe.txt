The
Omni-Universe
is a collection of over 350 billion

Life
[
]
Life in the Omni-Universe come's in many ways, like
Omni-Aliens
,
Omni-Humans
,
Omni-Stars
, and even
Omni-Blackholes
, which are widely believed to be sentient.
Even more abstracts??
[
]
The reason that there's multiple galaxies each with more life representing all abstracts was caused by
The Inter-Omni War
, which separated all
Omni-Galaxies
apart and COMPLETELY shifted their view point on abstracts.  Each
Omni-Galaxy
is different from the other.  For example, our local
Omni-Galaxy
, the Omni-Milkyway, has a religion for abstracts called, plain and simple, "Abstractness".  However, a different
Omni-Galaxy
, like for example the Omni-Andromeda, has a different Religion for abstracts called "Anti-Absolutism" with several different massive changes.
Outside it
[
]
Outside the Omni-Universe is the
Nested Reality
, which at first doesn't make sense, as all forms of the word abstract and all definitions of it exist in this Omni-Universe.  However, it does start to make sense once you think about this; Different Omni-Universes have different
Omni-Laws
, meaning that physics, words, etc are completely and utterly changed in a different Omni-Universe.
