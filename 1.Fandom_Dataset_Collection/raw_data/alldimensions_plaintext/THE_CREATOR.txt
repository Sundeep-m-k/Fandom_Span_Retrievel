THE CREATOR
is a
being
classified as a '
Primordial Entity
', similar to the
Primordial
, as they were both created before time itself.
THE CREATOR's job is to... well create,
verses
and creatures/civilizations to be exact, using
Pencils
and drawing on
Papers
. It also lives in a
Room
.
THE CREATOR is a very neutral entity, only in an alliance with 2 other Primordial Entities, the Primordial and Partially
the Brothers
, and is enemies with
Vood'Em
, and with the help of the Primordial, banished it "forever" to a
BEYOND HELL
.
There is said to be an entity above THE CREATOR but It has not been confirmed nor discovered. Some believe THE CREATOR is a false god and a distraction from the real one. If true, then THE CREATOR bows to the actual creator. We do not know what may lie beyond THE CREATOR.
The True Creator
is confirmed to be the god of THE CREATOR. It is confirmed that THE CREATOR bows down to The True Creator.
