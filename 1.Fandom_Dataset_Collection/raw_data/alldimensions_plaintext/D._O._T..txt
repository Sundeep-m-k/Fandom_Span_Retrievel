DOTs
or
Dense Organized Terrains
are extremely hot circles containing about 30
Large Miniclusters
. At ¬ø, they're
class 25
structures being part of
the Extended Post-Hierarchy
. They're contained by
black and whites
.
DOTs tend to form structures known as "Large Clusters" which consist of collections of 6 Large Miniclusters. Theres one Large Cluster every 5 Large Miniclusters, with the latters surrounding the formers in an organized pattern (thats why DOTs have "organized" as part of their acronym). DOTs can combine and make structures known as LINE, which can make up 0.7% of their local black and whites.

A
Rogue Archverse
hit our DOT and broke it, though over time it repaired itself thanks to several new Large Clusters and Miniclusters forming.

Another DOT hit ours, turning it into a tiny LINE.
