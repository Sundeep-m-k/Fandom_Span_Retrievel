The
Deltaverse
is one of the strangest
Universes
to ever exist in
our
Multiverse
's lifetime.
Central black hole
[
]
In the center of the Deltaverse, there is an ultramassive
black hole
with a
mass
of about 300 quadrillion M
☉
, with every
galaxy
in the Deltaverse orbiting it. All sub-galaxy structures are the same as
our own Universe
. As a result, there are no galaxy
clusters
,
superclusters
,
filaments
, or
tublaxas
[

]
, but there are
star
systems and clusters.
The black hole is also keeping the universe at a stable size of ~1.57 trillion ly, with the forces of dark energy and the black hole's
gravity
just about equalizing.
Origins
[
]
It is currently unknown how the ultramassive black hole formed, though it is speculated that at least two universes collided together very tightly, with the majority of the matter being compressed into the black hole, and the rest ending up in an orbit around it.
Future of the Deltaverse
[
]
Scientists estimate that all matter will be consumed by the ultramassive black hole about 30-ish quadrillion years from now, and that the black hole itself will die from Hawking radiation in about 10
130
years from now.
