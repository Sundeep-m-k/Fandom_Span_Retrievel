Sixteen
("
Grob'baf"
in
The Pencil Language
or
Exdak
in Future English) is the verse right after
Fifteen
, and is the 6th verse in the Eleven Chain. It has the property to slowly corrupt a creature/object's information and properties of things the longer they are exposed to it, making Sixteen a very dangerous place.
Appearance
[
]
Sixteen, from the inside, is a huge mess of colors and corrupted information. From the outside, Sixteen appears to be a cube with strange markings on it. These markings have not been found to have any real meaning, and are probably just naturally-formed.
Structure
[
]
Sixteen, just like Fifteen, has a very messy interior. Random objects, corrupted beyond oblivion, reside here. Raw information is present here, so trying to enter Sixteen would be a terrible idea due to the information corrupting you and turning you into a mess of disconnected information.

Fifteens
rotate around Sixteen. The reason why they are outside of Sixteen is due to the interior of Sixteen and its information corrupting properties.
