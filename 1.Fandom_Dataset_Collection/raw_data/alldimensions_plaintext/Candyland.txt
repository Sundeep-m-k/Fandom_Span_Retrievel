Candyland
is a planet in the Sugarsun binary star system which is home to many sugar-based folk and landscapes with different parts contributing to its uniqueness as a whole. While it is the name of a planet, it is also the name of a nation based on said location which has taken over the
Foodverse
. Only the residents, Candymen, and in some spots terrain are 100% made of candy, the rest is made of other foods just like everything else in the Foodverse.
Planet

Plants and Animals

Very similar to those of earth, aside from some slight size differences and being made out of food. Not much to say except that they're all pretty tasty. A few of them are Candyman livestock, Very important to the ecosystem, like with all animals.
Geography
[
]
Candyland's geography is very extreme from high mountains within boiling deserts to hilly valleys of the tundras. Here on this odd planet are many areas of oddities, with unique features and parts of terrain not found on Earth's surface. The Candymen's core elements are also found in these biomes' extremes
Candymen
[
]
Candymen, the dominant species on the planet, come in 5 flavors, all of which have different attributes when it comes to the cores they're born with. The first Candyman was sculpted by some sort of unique animal which shared no relations with earthly species, and died after completing sculpting. This is repeated for population growth of the Candymen, aside from the death after creation part of course.
Candymen come in 6 different flavors with distinct personalities and ad/disadvantages. Of the flavors, they are based on different terrains and such. peppermint flavor Candymen, modeled after the woodlands and the trees of peppermint are slightly more adapted to cold cores. These guys are patient, intelligent, and slightly frail compared to the others. The chocolate flavor Candymen, which take the form of fermented cocoa bars. While best adapted for combat in most cases, they lack a lot of social skills and rely heavily in their fighting capabilities to get by, usually in military or very rough sporting conditions. The pistachio flavored candymen, which are made of the pistachio ice cream snow and take on their properties, are very diligent and quick thinkers, while being more sluggish in other fields of reaction along with a bit of weakness. Their cones cover up to the lower shoulder. Birthday cake flavor Candymen are empathetic yet quick to temper, being very charismatic and social. Personality-wise, cookie dough and cookies & cream Candymen tend to be very similar, with low intelligence and charisma in exchange for a very giant-like power and durability. They get along very well with one another.
A Candyman's core is a large section of the body which acts as both the heart and brain, and is located in the chest with large size (candy doesn't breathe) while controlling their element; heat or cold. Heat cores affect the five different Candymen flavors differently.
Heat-core candies
[
]
Peppermint flavor (Candy cane): Heat core makes it soft and squishy, akin to the candirt. This lets it control the sweeter parts of the soil, and with enough practice even the most sugarless samples.
Chocolate flavor: They become semi-melted and fluid like the waves of the waters, and allow them to control many liquids from different sources, although it takes very extreme skill to control those inside living beings or with extreme pH levels.
Pistachio Flavor (Ice cream): Incompatable, a Pistac. Candyman will not form with a heat core.
Birthday cake flavor: Natural masters of all things heated, coming from the crumbs of the arid Oven Deserts they are masters of all dry and hot. Fire is their home, and it's best you don't come knocking.
Cookie dough flavor: One of the less elementally gifted flavors, they have lesser control over many of the heat-based elements of reality. Apply everything said about the B-cake flavor here to a much lesser extent. Although they are able to separate and re-attach body parts at will with these cores, as becoming baked cookie dough allows greater understanding of the body.
Cookies and Cream: Their shells harden, covering their whole bodies, and their softer insides become more vulnerable, melted from heat. They tend to be  projectile-conjurers, using summoned shell shards to launch at others. Also pretty durable.
Cold-core Candies
[
]
With a cold core, or a chill core, these are the general abilities of the Candymen.
Peppermint flavor: The freeze reminds them of the festive times, and their mental abilities are increased considerably.  They act much like the C&C of heat, but without the softer insides and greater melee prowess. Cold core peppermints tend to be great students and knights.
Chocolate flavor: Very neutral when it comes to Cold Cores, they are elemental generalists when it comes to control, able to manipulate just about anything. They become a bit harder physically as well, being colder and such.
Pistachio: Masters of the ever-frosty, natural control of this element is their absolute domain. Anywhere even lukewarm can be frozen in moments with great enough skill. its their turf, Don't come trespassing.
B-day Cake flavor: Incompatible. Will not form with a cold core.
Cookie dough flavor: They grow in size, oddly enough, and become much easier to kill. This, however, is a trade-off for their nearly Pistachio levels of ice control, and they are able to manipulate water as well, the more pure the better. Neither are on the level of cold core Pistachio or heat core Chocolate. Their position as generalists makes them ample for magic experiments and instructing classes on Candyman control.
Cookies and Cream flavor: Every part of their body hardens, and they begin to shrink in size, increasing density. This also applies to their cores themselves, making them much harder to slay. They are very weak offensively, though, and cannot control anything important, at best being able to bring a slight gust of wind at a small scale. Their toughness makes them prime volunteers for any intense physical experiments.

Currently at peak of the

and parts of various other inner omniversal structures.
The Serene State of Greater Candyland, or just Candyland, is a very large and very vibrant place culturally and economically, but definitely not politically. There is one immortal dictator installed, Frankensweet II, who has various portions of his body stitched together by his parent Frankensweet. Aside from his past, this man is very powerful and has been seen 1v1ing low-universal level gods and barely winning, with a very important fight taking place only 3 years ago. He rules with a caring but diamantidite fist.
In technologies, they've made the basic advancements of subatomic particle rearrangement and species changing pills or shots, as well as inter-versal travel outside their home of the Foodverse. They're also able to change the core of Candymen and choose the flavor of the species-changing shots (which are mandatory for new citizens), with experimental flavor-changing in already existing Candymen underway. Aside from that general overview, they have turned all the planets in the Foodverse into replicas of Candyland, with 100% sugar terrain of course, (although this movement has been one of the few to cause backlash due to ruining the diversity of the Foodverse) and aren't very special technologically aside from the things put into their magic core abilities.
In terms of trade and economics, most of everything is very internal as they are very aggressive towards basically everything that isn't sugary or at least food-based. They have a rich insect farming industry, and are very socialistic in policy, butting into a lot of business. about 30% of the market is government-owned, but it never feels too intrusive. It's like they're another private brand on the market
They're very war happy and never negotiate with anything less then 3/4 their size. "Ruthless expansion to gain more people to help better themselves," as Frankensweet says. They tend to focus on their ground forces with all of their elemental abilities, and always lure enemies into the sugar planets where their warriors are suited, or make their own in enemy territory.
In terms of how the citizens act, the flavors usually ignore their pre-determined conditions in many cases, but there are slightly skewed percentages in profession due to just naturally fitting in better. They're very culinarily creative and diverse, with insects, lizards, and jelly/butterfish are always on the menu. Very accepting of their own kind, but never accept an alien unless they turn Candyman. Media is very all over the place, and like with their food anything is up to watch, play, and interact with. The most popular franchise seems to be the ^^^& series, a classic RPG similar to
Dragon Quest
