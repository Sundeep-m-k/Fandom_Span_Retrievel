The Banana Cakes are servants to
Fudgecake
and Mr Banana. They are relatively young for their role with the oldest of them being only 710 tredicillion

Forms

In their dormant form the Banana Cakes look like regular banana cakes. But in their active form they turn into bananas with an eye on them. The banana cakes literally do everything for their masters.
Origin
[
]
They were ordinary banana cakes until Fudgecake mutated them recently to form his servants. Fudgecake is also quite young so that explains why all of the banana cakes are young too.
