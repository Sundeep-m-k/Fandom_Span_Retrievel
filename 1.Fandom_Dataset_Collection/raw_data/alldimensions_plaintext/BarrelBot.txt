(When making delivery)
Barrelbot
, or
BB-0.0
is an prototype of an
Barrel
-Delivering service machine. It can go tho enormous speeds to deliver in no time their charge. This robot was created by the
Barrel Company
to deliver easier their barrels. Soon, the Barrelbots will get upgrades, as an bigger size, be even faster, etc. There might also be a teleporting variant in the future, but that would take a long time because of its immense size.
The only problem is that they have low battery, so the company must recharge them always so they dont stop moving when they are going to deliver barrels. Donations are highly appreciated to make these robots even better in less time! Like
Barrel Corp.
said, "We are the future..."
There is an actual upgrade in progress to make the previously mentioned thing (Better charge)
There used to be a variation of barrelbots that would go faster to deliver barrels, but it ran out of battery too fast so they tried to make a self charging variant that would charge it by taking solar energy from nearby omniverses, but that one was too expensive.
