LAIF, standing for Large Absolute Infinity Function, is a function made for defining or comparing cardinals that are
absolutely infinite
or larger. LAIF is found in the form of
∞
(
α
,
β
)
{\displaystyle \infin(\alpha,\beta)}
, where
α
{\displaystyle \alpha}
and
β
{\displaystyle \beta}
are both ordinals.
Definition
[
]
We can define
∞
(
α
,
β
)
{\displaystyle \infin(\alpha,\beta)}
in a few rules. First,
∞
(
α
,
0
)
=
α
{\displaystyle \infin(\alpha,0)=\alpha}
, or when
β
{\displaystyle \beta}
is 0, the answer will always be the other input,
α
{\displaystyle \alpha}
. Eventually, we reach absolute infinity (in this case I will be using the character
Ψ
{\displaystyle \Psi}
for absolute infinity, but this is unofficial), or
∞
(
Ψ
,
0
)
{\displaystyle \infin(\Psi,0)}
. This will still be
Ψ
{\displaystyle \Psi}
, but it is also equal to
∞
(
0
,
1
)
{\displaystyle \infin(0,1)}
. For us to get to
∞
(
1
,
1
)
{\displaystyle \infin(1,1)}
, whatever we did to get to
Ψ
{\displaystyle \Psi}
, we do it again onto
Ψ
{\displaystyle \Psi}
, getting an 'absolute absolute' infinity. We can then continue to
∞
(
2
,
1
)
{\displaystyle \infin(2,1)}
, which is applying
Ψ
{\displaystyle \Psi}
to
∞
(
1
,
1
)
{\displaystyle \infin(1,1)}
,
∞
(
3
,
1
)
{\displaystyle \infin(3,1)}
is applying
Ψ
{\displaystyle \Psi}
to
∞
(
2
,
1
)
{\displaystyle \infin(2,1)}
,
∞
(
4
,
1
)
{\displaystyle \infin(4,1)}
is applying
Ψ
{\displaystyle \Psi}
to
∞
(
3
,
1
)
{\displaystyle \infin(3,1)}
, etc.
We then get to
∞
(
ω
,
1
)
{\displaystyle \infin(\omega,1)}
, which is the limit of
∞
(
0
,
1
)
,
∞
(
1
,
1
)
,
∞
(
2
,
1
)
,
∞
(
3
,
1
)
,
.
.
.
{\displaystyle \infin(0,1),\infin(1,1),\infin(2,1),\infin(3,1),...}
, and we can continue on like this, eventually getting to
κ
=
∞
(
κ
,
0
)
{\textstyle \kappa=\infin(\kappa,0)}
, which is equal to
∞
(
0
,
2
)
{\displaystyle \infin(0,2)}
. To get to
∞
(
1
,
2
)
{\displaystyle \infin(1,2)}
, we use whatever we did to get to
∞
(
0
,
2
)
{\displaystyle \infin(0,2)}
on
∞
(
1
,
2
)
{\displaystyle \infin(1,2)}
, and you are probably getting to pattern now. To get to
∞
(
2
,
2
)
{\displaystyle \infin(2,2)}
, we apply
∞
(
0
,
2
)
{\displaystyle \infin(0,2)}
to
∞
(
1
,
2
)
{\displaystyle \infin(1,2)}
, and we can continue, eventually getting to
κ
=
∞
(
κ
,
2
)
{\displaystyle \kappa=\infin(\kappa,2)}
, which is equal to
∞
(
0
,
3
)
{\displaystyle \infin(0,3)}
,
κ
=
∞
(
κ
,
3
)
=
∞
(
0
,
4
)
{\displaystyle \kappa=\infin(\kappa,3)=\infin(0,4)}
,
κ
=
∞
(
κ
,
4
)
=
∞
(
0
,
5
)
{\displaystyle \kappa=\infin(\kappa,4)=\infin(0,5)}
, and in general,
κ
=
∞
(
κ
,
β
)
=
∞
(
0
,
β
+
1
)
{\displaystyle \kappa=\infin(\kappa,\beta)=\infin(0,\beta+1)}
. We can also have all ordinals in the second entry, so
∞
(
0
,
ω
)
=
{
∞
(
0
,
0
)
,
∞
(
0
,
1
)
,
∞
(
0
,
2
)
,
∞
(
0
,
3
)
.
.
.
}
{\displaystyle \infin(0,\omega)=\{\infin(0,0),\infin(0,1),\infin(0,2),\infin(0,3)...\}}
.
The function reaches its limit when we have the number
κ
=
∞
(
0
,
κ
)
{\displaystyle \kappa=\infin(0,\kappa)}
. You would need to extend the function or make a new function to create larger numbers.
Details on
Ψ
{\displaystyle \Psi}
[
]
When absolute infinity was previously defined, the actual way of obtaining it was left very vague. To help with this, here is a more well-defined description of
Ψ
{\displaystyle \Psi}
.
Before we imagine absolute infinity, let’s instead imagine the jump from 0 to 1. Pretty simple, right? We’re just going to the next whole number (the technical name for this is the
successor
). Next, let’s take the jump from 1 to
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
. No matter how many times we take the successor of 1, we never reach omega. This is called a
limit ordinal
, although this is a pretty oversimplified definition. Before we take the jump to
Ψ
{\displaystyle \Psi}
, let’s first go from
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
to
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
. No matter how many times we use limit ordinals or successors on
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
, we will never reach
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
.
You may start to see a pattern here.
1 is the first number you cannot reach without increasing the value,
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
is the first number you cannot reach with successors,
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
is the first number you cannot reach with limit ordinals or successors,
But what is
Ψ
{\displaystyle \Psi}
then? Well, the definition is basically that
Ψ
{\displaystyle \Psi}
is the first number you cannot reach with successors, limit ordinals, or non-self-referential ‘the first number you cannot reach’ definitions.
That non-self-referential portion is important, or else you would be able to say that
Ψ
>
Ψ
{\displaystyle \Psi>\Psi}
, which is a contradiction (although there are cardinals and ordinals which contradict themselves).
Reaching
∞
(

,
1
)
{\displaystyle \infin(1,1)}
[
]
To get to
∞
(
1
,
1
)
{\displaystyle \infin(1,1)}
from absolute infinity, we simply just say that this number is the first number that cannot be reached with successors, limit ordinals, and non-self-referential ‘the first number you cannot reach’ definitions on
∞
(
0
,
1
)
{\displaystyle \infin(0,1)}
. This can easily be extended to all numbers beginning with a 1 in LAIF, by just replacing
0
,
1
{\displaystyle 0,1}
with
β
,
1
{\displaystyle \beta,1}
and
1
,
1
{\displaystyle 1,1}
with
β
+
1
,
1
{\displaystyle \beta+1,1}
.
