Animae Requiem Aeternae, In Alienis Aeonibus Etiam Mors Moriatur(Eternal Rest of Souls May lie, Even Death May Dies in Strange Aeons)
The
Sarpanomicon
or as translated "The Divine Book of Mysteries and Truth" is a ancient book that was documented by countless authors about the truth of the old worlds, however countless people tried to destroy the Sarpanomicon but it was way too strong to even destroy, it was burned, exploded, dropped in acid, and even smited but the book remained itself

A better image of Sarpanomicon book by Verseofficial91)
If you're reading this then you have to know the truth... Do not believe the
Deus nihil
he who holds the
blades
tried to destroy our worlds for eons, for he is the embodiment of hate, do not believe The
Tinea letum
for
it tried to kill all of us, for he is the embodiment of chaos, do not believe the
Unus Qui Mentitur
for he lied to us it promised us riches and power but only brought death, for he is the embodiment of lies, those three tried to destroy our worlds for eons and eons, Hate, Chaos, Lies, they all tried to destroy us but we stayed living for we hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil, however they got defeated by
The One with No Name
which was a glimpse of hope, the embodiments of hate, chaos, lies became former shells of what they used to be however for eons now, they seek
REVENGE
Aganist us, they will come back and we wonder if what Incomprehensibe forms they will take?
Chapter 2:(Possession of Power)

if you wanna know how to access power then you are in luck, step 1 is you must focus on a specific spell, fire spells focus on the wrath, air spells focus on the calm, water spells focus on the love, earth spells focus on the connection to the natural world, however if you are looking for more complex elements like lightning, light, darkness, matter, space, time then those all have something to focus on too, step two is once you focus on that spell your mind must manifest the spell into existence and how much time you manifest the spell is how powerful it will be, if it's for a minute it will be a regular spell however if it's for a hour then it will be powerful and if it's for a day it will be the most powerful version of itself, step three is optional, combing spells will create new spells, step four is the type of spells which is the black or white types, black spells are forbidden and consist of elements commonly associated with sin and evil, white spells however are accepted and consist of elements commonly associated with virtues and good
Chapter 3:(The Illusions)

Illusion magic or Perception Control is a type of magic that aims to deceive the eye(vision/sight) in a way, to do this type of magic you must find a phantom once you defeat the phantom then u must consume it's powers making you appear to manipulate reality to other eyes however this is just Illusions.
Chapter 4:(The Blades)
[
]
The Blades of Equilibrium are two blades held by
someone...
the blades are called The Darkheart(a void sword made of full darkness that steals life from enemies) and The Illumina (a light sword made of pure light that can do aerial dash and do powerful strikes when precisioned correctly) when they combine they can destroy or create Worlds, these swords were here before existence even existed and since they are two opposing forces that attract each other if they combined then they would make The Eclipse Blade of The Sun and Moon or The Equilibrium Striker.

before time and before even that was VLTRA the END OF ALL ENDS, it was technically a verse even though it's beyond that, even before any verse vltra was already bigger than omniverses, then it grew higher than some stuff called Hierarchies, some of the metalogical kind and then it grew above that and now it's current "size" is pretty big like 2 ×© which is bigger than that one totum thing
