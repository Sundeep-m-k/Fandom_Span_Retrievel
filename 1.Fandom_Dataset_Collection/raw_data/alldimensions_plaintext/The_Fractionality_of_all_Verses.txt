Description of the Verse
[
]
This verse appears to be very tough, being nearly impossible to break. This verse acts as a barrier, preventing the things it contains from spilling out into
TFLOAV
. Many attempts have been made to break this barrier, and of those, only a handful have been successful. The Fehu rune can be seen on the surface of the barrier. Destroying one of these symbols weakens the barrier enough in that area to break through it. If a large enough hole is made in the barrier, the whole barrier will collapse, destroy the verses it contained.
Fortunately, the likelihood of this happening is extremely low, so we shouldn't be too worried about a full barrier collapse happening. That is all we know about this verse for right now.
