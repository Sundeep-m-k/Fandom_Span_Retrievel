Only
Him
can exist here
The
Voidance
is an emptiness where nothing existed, exists, anti-exists, nor will exist. It is an area where nothing can exist. Even if something like an
Omniverse
somehow got out, it will disappear COMPLETELY from Existance, Non Existence, and Anti-Existence. If nothing escaped, that nothing will disappear.
The only thing that can exist in the Voidance is
Him
, the leader of
the Transcendents
. The only thing that keeps it from collapsing and deleting everything and nothing is the chaotic laws of our
Unique Location.
