Layers
[
]
The borders
[
]
The first (outer to inner) layer of a Barrier of Reality consists of the border; it's a solid but also a liquid, because it moves like a liquid, but you cant escape like a solid. These contain all that is describable and indescribable, but they're super dense because the specks consist of all the
Bonds
within them.
Even though these barriers are supposed to contain everything describable and indescribable, they have many flaws, thus allowing even the mortal
creatures
to comprehend what is beyond their Barriers of Reality. But, there is a major flaw, the outer area. Out of the barrier is... weird. Because reality exists, but doesn't exist at the same time.
Note:
Do not try to turn a Barrier of Reality into a
cube
. Your eyes will turn into
octagons
, and your hands will turn into
triangles
.

These actually aren't everything (duh).
They can be escaped (only by infinite speed and more).
Ours has been escaped 10 times by different entities or
civilizations
