The
True transcendium
, also known as
transcendium Ultima
is the biggest verse in the
transcendent verses
chain. It doesn't have a core, but we know its appearance (check infobox's image). It also contains Transcendium dioxide. A lot of things about this place remains unknown.
Temperature
[

Its a bit warmer than
The Great Void
, but its still cold. The latter fact is specially odd since True transcendiums are barely bigger than the Great Void, being only 50% bigger than them on average.
Fun fact regarding the name
[
]
This originally was meant to be called
transcendium Ultima
, but someone (aka Sbv, the co-creator of Igenti class) already did it and I cant modify it because unfortunately it is a blog post. Take this transcendium Ultima as the real one.
