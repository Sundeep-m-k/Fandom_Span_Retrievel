The Powertree is a divergent structure marking the transition from
Post-Loop verses
to the Hyperbolic verses. Superior verses to the Powertree begin to devolve away from a hierarchical structure of linear containment, and form a highly disjoint system going against pre-established laws and axioms.
Megadivergence
[
]
As the Powertree is the centerpiece of the disorderly Hyperbolic verses, it is under pressure from many co-existing hierarchies to conform to the laws of a chain. Occasionally, a
megadivergence
event occurs, causing the Powertree to duplicate into multiple separate chains.
This phenomena pulls apart the central verses of high-level looped verses it interacts with, making
derefverses
form. Derefverses are no longer based on a lower-level verse, and as such are undefined and destructive.
