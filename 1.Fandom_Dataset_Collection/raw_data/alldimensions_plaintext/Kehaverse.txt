Venus
, but some planets here, like the planet Kehla, do not have volcanic lava like
Venus
, only yellow sand and yellow storm clouds with a speed of 12 km/h. There are rocky plateaus and large boulders in the form of arcs that are brown mixed with yellow. As for the stars, There are stars that match all the characteristics of the star that exists in our universe, which is called Enif.
Planets gravity
[

The gravity of the planets is very strong, more than 5 newtons, as it makes even the bridges of rocks and objects short, thick, and more flat due to gravity. The gravity of the planets here is a little less, and there is only a little left for them to reach the gravity of the
sun
. You can say that the gravity of the planets here is like
Jupiter
.

called Bacteria, but with the head of a black wolf on these planets. In addition to the fact that its body is thicker than before, these creatures are called
Wolf-heads
