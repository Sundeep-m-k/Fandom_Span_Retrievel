The
Rizz Quark
or
r quark
(symbol: r)
is a
quark
which is mostly identical to the
down quark
, except for its mass. It is a constituent of
cuandavii
and of all cuandaic elements. Its antiparticle is the
Antirizz Quark
(symbol: r̄)
. Like other particles, rizz quarks contain
preons
and a
blueprint gene
that dictates its properties.
History
[
]
The Rizz Quark was first discovered in the Large Bababooey Collider in Portugal in the year 2342, when an experiment was conducted on
cuandavii
, where the Rizz Quark was discovered. The way it got the name is explained in the quote.
