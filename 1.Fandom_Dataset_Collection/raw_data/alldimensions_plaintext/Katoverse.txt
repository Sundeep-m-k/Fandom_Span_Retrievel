Katoverse or 'Quaternionverse', is a verse with quaternion dimensions, it is an absolute hell. How does one even describe it? Its completely unimaginable, and impossible to reach. And of course, Its contained by the
Primordialverse
. The state of being there is almost comparable to
BEYOND HELL
, any chance of life would be impossible here.
Even the sight of its true form is enough to kill and de-compose the soul of a viewer. Its aura from quadrillions of lightyears away is enough to boil the skin off of any normal mortal being. Not even
Imaginary Lifeforms
would be willing of entering this realm.
