A
Fractal Sphere
is a semi-3D version of a 2D fractal, whereas a 2D fractal has an
infinite perimeter
, a Fractal Sphere has an
infinite surface area and
0 volume.
Fractal Spheres
roam the
Omniverse
,
The Box
,
The Outside
and everything within, being generally noted as invisible. These spheres come in
all
sizes, from 1 yottaparsec to 1 yoctometer and disintegrate upon coming in contact with
any
matter.
Most
Fractal Spheres
lie either outside of the
Omniverse
, in
The Outside
, or in the spaces in between verses, due to a lack of matter.
2 types of Fractal Spheres exist,
those being
layered
and
straight
.
Layered spheres
are made up of
infinite
sheets of
infinitely
thin circles with
infinitely
many circles inside of themselves. These sheets go around the center 360 degrees, separated by
infinitely
thin vacuum.
Straight spheres
are made up of
infinite
1D straight lines, coming from the center.
