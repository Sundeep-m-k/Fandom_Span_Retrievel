An infinite amount of mazes that extend infinitely in all but one spatial dimensions.
The
Infinite Maze
, the
Maze of Unknown
, or even the
Onion Maze
due to it's infinite layers, is a verse that contains an infinite amount of mazes, almost all of which extend infinitely in all spatial dimensions except one. The walls and floors cannot be phased through or broken, and some mazes have threats to stop entities that stumble into these mazes. They are all connected in some way, usually through stairs. Most of the time the walls are a greenish-blue and the floor is brown, however in some mazes this can change.
The individual mazes are called layers.

Layers

Layer 1: Beginning
[
]
A portal to Layer 1 will open in random positions, and will no longer be usable to escape the Infinite Maze once you enter Layer 2. It is a simple maze and the stairs down to Layer 2 are very close to the portal.
Layer 16: Threats begin to emerge
[
]
Layer 16 is like the previous layers before it, however there is a broken wall that can be used to enter Layer 1-VOID.
Void Layers: Welcome to the void
[
]
In Layer 16 and beyond, you can find broken walls and even parts of the floor that lead you to Layer 1-VOID. The Void Layers are special layers that are all black, with grey edges that can only be seen using a form of flashlight. They can contain M̴o̵n̸s̶t̷e̶r̴s at any point, starting as early as Layer 4-VOID.
Layer 48: Find the key
[
]
Once you reach Layer 48, the exit will be blocked off by a locked door. It has been found to be impossible to lockpick, unhinge, or break these doors, and it forces you to find a key. Once you find the key and the door, you can continue to Layer 49.
Layer 250: Darkness
[
]
After Layer 249, the hallway leading to Layer 250 will not have lights on the ceiling. This is the case for all layers past this point. At Layer 256, M̴o̵n̸s̶t̷e̶r̴s can appear, which appear to be dark shadows with white eyes. They mostly stand still, and rarely move. They'll kill you if you get too close.
Layer 1000: Basement
[
]
At Layer 1000, the walls and floor change color to resemble a basement. It is still entirely possible to encounter M̴o̵n̸s̶t̷e̶r̴s in here, however they become more abundant. It is still dark in here, so be careful.
Layer 2500: Deadly
[
]
Wow. You made it through 2500 entire mazes. How about we just end your streak? At this point, the walls become blood red and the floor turns black. Portals to Layer 1-VOID become very common here, and M̴o̵n̸s̶t̷e̶r̴s begin to move around. You may find doors anywhere in the layers that are locked and require keys to open. Layer 4999 has a door at the end with the key to open it right in front of it. You'll understand why in a little bit.
Layer 5000: Safety...?
[
]
At this point, the layers become normal again. After 5100 however, you can get random types of layers, being either normal, dark, basement, or deadly layers. There's a hidden machine in Layer 1043 that allows you to skip to Layer 5000. If you input a piece of paper that has a specific code on it, it'll give you a portal to the 5000th Layer. The door on Layer 4999 is to protect you from the deadly floors if you use the skip on Layer 1043.
Layer 29999: The furthest that has been reached
[
]
Nobody has gone past this point, so we do not know what lies beyond. This is currently the hardest floor to pass that we know of, as no entity that has reached Layer 29999 has survived it. It may be that 30000 is one of the best floors in the Infinite Maze, and 29999 is hard to prevent the unworthy from entering 30000.
Layer 4000-VOID: Return to normality
[
]
If you ever get here, it will look like a normal layer (no void layer style) and the stairs will be replaced with a portal back to Layer 1. This is the only known way to exit the Void Layers, and past Layer 2500-VOID you can get "deadly void floors" where M̴o̵n̸s̶t̷e̶r̴s actively chase you instead of wandering around.
