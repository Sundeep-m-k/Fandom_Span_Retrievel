Introduction

Kosmikokatastrofeís asteroeideís
, or "Cosmic-destroyer asteroids" are enormous
asteroid
-looking objects that float in the space. But, they are made of an extremly hot, resistent and toxic sustance knowed as "
Catastrofium
". They have somehow an "intelligence" that makes them increase their speed when they see an 'verse, and go towards them to destroy them. There are lots of tiers of dangerousness that these asteroeideís can have.
Dangerousness tiers
[
]
Tier 1 asteroeideís
[
]
Tier 1 asteroeideís are the less dangerous type of asteroeideís, but they still are extremly powerfull. They commonly have an shiny white color, and have an Aprox. size of

{\displaystyle 10:\omega^\omega}
LY. These types of asteroeideís can destroy from 1 to 3

Tier 2 asteroeideís
[

Tier 2 asteroeideís are the 2nd weakest type of asteroeideís. Their are an 30% hotter than tier 1 asteroeideís, and their Aprox. size reachs to

LY. These type of asteroeideís can easily destroy things like The Great Square, but still cant destroy things like
The Super Space
. They even have a bit of gravity attraction that is 20 times bigger than the asteroeideís they are making effect. They have the same colors
Tier 3 asteroeideís

Tier 3 asteroeideís are 500% hotter than the tier 2 asteroeideís, and also 50% more radioactive. These have a shiny green color, and they have an Aprox. size of

The Absolute Existence
are absolutely destroyed by asteroeideís tier 3. Even bigger things like
Knathsuperverse
or (Arguably)
Kolmnasuperverse
or E V E N far bigger than those can
maybe
be destroyed, but its not confirmed.
Tier 4 asteroeideís
[
]
Tier 4 asteroeideís are the 3rd more dangerous type of asteroeideís, which are far hotter and more radioctive than tier 3 asteroeideís. These have an red color, and are extremly dangerous. These are soo big that we cant even have an Aprox. size of them, an issue that will happen with the next 2 tiers of asteroeideís. But, its confirmed that one of these can destroy
Time and reality
with ease.
Tier 5 asteroeideís
[
]
Tier 5 asteroeideís are the 2nd most dangerous tier of asteroeideís. They have an purple-orange color, and they can make very high and loud sounds, so they can aturd entities and destroy them too. Their gravity area is also bigger, being 50 times bigger than the asteroeideís itself.
The Infinite Infinity
would become "The nothing nothing" if a tier 5 asteoeideís colides with it.
Tier 6 asteroeideís
[
]
This is the most dangerous asteroeides (The 6.5 asteroeideís are somehow the same tier as these), and it can be defined as an mega-cosmic calamity. It has the habilities of the tier 5 asteroeideís, but a lot buffed. These are also somehow alive, and now they not only destroy 'verses, they also eat them to become slighty bigger. This last thing is very important in a future, so keep reading. A
Quadboboverse
will be converted to dust if an tier 6 asteroeideís colides with it.
Tier 6.5 asteroeideís
[
]
Tier 6.5 asteroeideís are tier 6 asteroeideís, but at their max limits. Now they cant eat anymore, and only 2 of these are recorded. They are so powerfull that not even
The Portal
or things of its same size could be safe of these asteroeideís. Its colors are red, purple, yellow and cyan. They also have a very scary and dangerous ability: They can generate more asteroeideís. Afortunately, these asteroeideís are even smaller than the tier 1 asteroeideís, but they are a lot. And they also have the hability to consume 'verses to grow, like tier 6 asteroeideís. They color is 100% blue, and they even have their special name:
míni pétres
.
What about an tier 7 asteroeideís?
[
]
That would be basicly impossible, because they cant grow anymore when they reach the tier 6.5. So a tier 7 asteroeideís cant exist. Unless it is created by a powerful entity.
