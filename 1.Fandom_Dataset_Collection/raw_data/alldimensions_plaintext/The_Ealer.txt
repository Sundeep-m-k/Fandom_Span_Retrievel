Preface:
The vast majority of knowledge about The Ealer, the one and only, comes from the Vowoez that orbit it. This information is unconfirmed, but Vowoez aren't known to lie on any occasions, so their statements are currently held as semi-factual, until proven otherwise.

The Ealer is a chaotically web-like shaped structure / creature that abstains from movement for as long as possible, only moving when absolutely necessary.
When looked at, using our 1st Realmly technology, The Ealer takes a much more simpler, concise and symmetrical shape; we can only see the core of it. Some may find this to be worse, due to the fact that we aren't seeing the actuality of The Ealer. Nonetheless, the image presented in the infobox to the right continues to be used omniversally, for the same reasons as to why the Solar system is rarely drawn to scale and is proportionately exaggerated; it's easier to look, simpler to render and provides the same content.
On the image to the right, the white-green freckles are individual cores, known as the Habbnali, and the two outstanding red muffled circles are called the Namdsum. To the Vowoez, they aren't "visible" (visible is in quotation marks, as the Vowoez don't exactly have sight, but perceive using pseudo-similiar methods), because they're deeply surrounded by the rest of the matter that composes The Ealer.
The composition of this matter, as well as that of the Habbnali or Namdsum, is totally unknown.
Habbnali
[
]
The myriads of size-variant Habbnali sprinkled in a symmetrical way across The Ealer, are as mentioned, core-like appendages that may or may not be responsible for the power of this creature.
Each Habbnali contains a point-particle outside of it (position dictates the particle is located in the Habbnali, but in reality is not contained by it, just mapped onto), associated with a unique well-defined Woodin cardinal. The point particle has an antipode of itself located half in the first Realm, and half in the third Realm. This point particle bears no appearence, but responds to physical stimmuli.
The point particles act like "portals" to these Realms, but instead of teleporting matter, they turn the entire Habbnali into an immitation of the places they're in. The real magic happens, however, because of the "half-containing" in two Realms. Strange and unexplained things happen, when you "halve", or really, act out any arithmetical functions on concepts, which guard entire Realms.
If manipulated correctly, which The Ealer does thanks to the wild and untamed nature of the second Realm it inhabits, each Habbnali can produce desired powers, up to a certain point (this is where the uncertainty of The Ealers strength comes in).
This is all nice and stuff, but so far, we have no way of outputting this power. This is where the two Namdsum come in.
Namdsum
[
]
The Namdsum, somehow, manifest the powers of the Habbnali and produce outputs. The word "somehow" is used here deliberately, as it is totally unknown as how The Ealer does it. While the Vowoez are highly knowledged in the inner workings of the second Realm, their Reality, even they know much more about the first Realm, than they know about theirs. It is unknown to them, as to how the Namdsum are capable of their doings. It is clear, that it involves manipulation of laws and second Realm equivalents to dimensions and all the other things; we just don't know what the details are to any degree.
But, a conjecture has been formed, which relies on the conciousness question of The Ealer being true, which as stated above, hasn't been proven yet. It follows, that the Namdsum are actually one, which act as a sort of brain for the The Ealer, which is also able to conduct all of the necessary steps itself. In this scenario, the Namdsum act as both a living-esque (again, not exactly living, terminology doesn't translate well from Realm to Realm) organism and a complex machine.
Powers
[
]
If The Ealer excels at anything, it is very clearly it's strength. The Ealer is unimaginably powerful. A couple of it's abilities are listed in the Vowoez article: The permanent, temporary or 0-time deletion of a finite sequence of dimensions (usually, this sequence needs be only a singleton), altering laws in infinitely or finitely sized regions of space (not axioms, however, that capability is a whole another range of power that The Ealer can't be compared to), manipulating the Grassland antipodes to harness some limited form of their power for itself to use, disobeying the axioms of Reality (this one is only known to occur in our Realm, as our we only known our axioms, not the ones of other Realms), defeating yourself in a battle but losing anyways, setting off paradoxes which clone themselves (and being able to stop them is a must when conducting this, which The Ealer can do).
Alongside these, include: manipulating regions of space to because deterministic (no randomness), and then predicting the future of what is going to happen (this may sound very specific and useless, but is in fact very useful when confronting enemies, as any free will is eradicated and all of the moves of the enemy can be predicted and countered), erasing events from occurring back in time, writing or erasing laws of the second Realm for one-time events (usually infinitesimally long), taking a Habbnali and transporting the one portal particle mapped onto it inside of an area where the enemy is, which will place them in an imitation of the third Realm mixed in with some first Realm order and absolutely mess with them.
These are again, just a couple of the easy-to-understand things The Ealer is capable of doing easily. The stronger the entity and the more easily it can be manipulated, the more it needs to protect itself, and The Ealer is definitely capable of doing that, alongside with its beehive of Vowoez encircling it at all times.
