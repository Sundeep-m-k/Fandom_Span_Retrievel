is an 'artificial' verse created and run by an entity who calls themself ℝ. In the ℝ Test, you have to correctly name every single real number's full name

, which is unachieveable by many entities. You are not forced to do it; you can leave at any time, although you may not save your progress. There is, however, a big reward if you complete it, as well as smaller prizes for certain milestones. The entity currently taking the test, DATA LOST, has somehow gotten to the hundreds and is still going strong as of now. There was also another entity who got up to the centillions, but they died of starvation before they could finish the test

The ℤ Test

The ℤ Test is a variation of The ℝ Test, which was created by ℝ as a 'beginner's version' of The ℝ Test. In the ℤ test, you must name every single integer correctly. It is technically easier than The ℝ Test. It is not a verse itself, but is instead contained within the verse known as The ℝ Test. It is less popular and not done as much as The ℝ Test, but some entities stop by to give it a try.
