This is the land of the largest loop. The differences are so strong that the
Earth
becomes indescribable. In a pathetic attempt to describe it, it was noticed that the Earth was non-Euclidean, contained itself, the galaxy, was in superposition. However, this is a drop in the ocean if we talk about all the properties of the Earth. There are also disputes: it is necessary to call it the land of the last loop or post-loop Earth.
Loopptima Infinity
is a galaxy for the last Earth.

Post Loop Size Index (
PLSI
)
[
]
This size index is used to measure post loop objects. That is, when the infinite loops end, the objects above will  have a real size, because they are not a simulation (but this is not accurate) and the post loop size is used to indicate the real size. In this case, this Earth is in PLSI of 0, since it is still a looped Earth but beyond all loops.
