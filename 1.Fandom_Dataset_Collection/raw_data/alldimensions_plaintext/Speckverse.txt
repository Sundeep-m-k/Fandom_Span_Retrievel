The Speckverse is an incredibly small
verse
that is only 3 inches in size. It is called the Speckverse because of how small it is. Rather than being 3 dimensional like our
universe
, the Speckverse is only 2 dimensional. No entities exist in this universe and it is relatively empty space except for a few galaxies, which due to the Speckverse's small size, are also very small.

The age of this verse and how it formed is mostly unknown. Scientists say it may have had a Big Bang like our universe. They say that it may only be a couple hundred thousand years old because of itâ€™s current state. Still though, scientists are researching more and more about this verse whenever they can.
Discovery
[
]
This verse was first discovered when astronomers were pointing a very strong telescope at random parts of the
Multiverse
. They eventually found a verse that seemed MUCH smaller than the other verses. Their first estimate for the size was 2 feet. After studying the verse a little more, they found out it was much smaller than 2 feet. In fact, it was only 3 inches!
