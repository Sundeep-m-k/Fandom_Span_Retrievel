Most common laws include, but are not limited to: General Relativity, Gravitational Attraction, Dark Energy Production, and The Universal Speed Limit.

Universe Formation
[
]
Universe actually form by the death of another universe. After approximately
∞
years, the basic structure of the universe will begin to break down due to dark energy, causing many big bangs to happen, creating new universes. Due to this cycle of creation and destruction, the number of universes multiply by an infinite amount every time this happens. It was unknown when this cycle first started, and how it was started, until we found out about the existence of a larger Archverse.
