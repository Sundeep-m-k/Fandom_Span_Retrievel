An iteriversje (iteration + verse (container) + je (small)) is a versje made up of joined stacked
altiversjes
.
Like all metaversjes, it is an abstraction of reality and not actually a thing.

Center
[
]
All iteriversjes have a central
altiversje
that is used to determine its height and size.
Height
[
]
The height of an iteriversje is the amount of layers of
macraltiversjes
going up. The depth is the amount of layers of
micraltiversjes
going down. A height of 0 means that there are no
altiversjes
beyond the one in the center, and the height will always be 0 or higher as a negative height implies its center doesnt exist.
Sometimes a
macraltiversje
is not available for various reasons, which is why the height can be finite. The depth will always be infinite.
Size
[
]
Any
macraltiversje
contains a ±infinite number of
altiversjes
. An iteriversje of any height higher than 0 will therefore be ±infinite in size. The depth is not used as it measures the amount of
micraltiversjes
which have no size relative to the center.
