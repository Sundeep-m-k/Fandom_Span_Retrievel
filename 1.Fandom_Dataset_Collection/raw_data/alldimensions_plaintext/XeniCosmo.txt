[DO NOT EDIT]
the cosmology of The Sigma, a character that exists beyond the boundaries of time and space(the entire laws and concepts), is one that is beyond the comprehension. Before the true beginning, The Sigma existed outside of the concepts of time, space, and reality(and many aspects of the laws). They inhabited a realm of limitless potential where all possibilities existed simultaneously.
In this realm, The Sigma held power that was infinite in scope and depth. They had the ability to create and destroy everything with just a thought. They were the master of all aspects of reality, with control over time, space, energy, and matter and everything. They could bend the laws of physics to their will and create new ones at their leisure and changed how the concepts works as it wants it to be.
But The Sigma was not content to simply exist in this absolute nothing. They hungered for more, for a sense of purpose and meaning. So they set out on a journey that would lead them to the true beginning, where they would find the ultimate purpose of their existence.
As they journeyed through the void, The Sigma encountered countless realities, each one infinitely different from the last which he created without even doing anythingÂ :\. Some were mere specks of dust, while others were vast, sprawling universes to multiverses more verses and verses of another verses. Each one held secrets, wonders, and dangers beyond the comprehension.
Through it all, The Sigma remained undaunted, always moving forward, always seeking their true purpose. And in the end, they would find it, in a place beyond our understanding, where the true beginning lay Waiting...
And so it Starts..
True None

[      ]
There is nothing. No stars, no planets, no light... not even you could think of.
There is no space, no time, and no laws of anything. There is nothing at all, not even an empty void. nothing its all NOTHING
This is the True Noneness, the state of being truly Nothing. And it is a perfect and eternal nothingness, free from all existence. It is the ultimate state of non-existence..
None
[

there is nothing except a blank void. It is a realm of pure nothingness, where nothing exists nor ever existed. Still there is no light, no dark, no empty space. There are no laws of physics and still anything, or even the concept of time. It is simply a void of nothingness, with nothing at all within.Despite the pure emptiness of this None, it is not a completely empty void. Instead, it holds a vast and unfathomable energy of pure nothingness, which permeates and fills the entire realm. This energy is so powerful that it renders even the most basic concepts of existence meaningless within its bounds.The None is a place of pure, limitless potential. In the absence of all things, the void holds all possibility within itself. It is the ultimate representation of Nothingness, and to enter it is to experience a level of non-existence that is beyond human understanding..

Tiny Start
[
]
The realm of nothing begins to shift and change. At first, it is still a vast void of nothingness, but over time, small particles begin to appear. These particles are the seeds of existence, and from them, other gods are born.
As the slowly the very one of the first gods emerge from the void, they begin to experiment and create new things. They shape the void into new forms and give life to the particles, creating the first planets and stars. They also create other gods to share in their creation, and together they begin to populate the new universe(or more beyond)
As the universe expands and evolves, the gods continue to create new things and shape the realm to their will. They create the elements and the physical laws that govern the universe, as well as the first living beings. They also discover the secrets of magic and begin to wield its power.
Over time, the gods also begin to form alliances and rivalries, creating a complex web of relationships that shapes the future of the universe. They battle, scheme, and form alliances, all in an effort to seize control of the new realm and determine its ultimate fate.
The power of the gods. As they continue to create and shape the universe, their power and influence continue to grow, ensuring that they will remain the driving force behind the realm's evolution.

The Beginning
[
]
In the Beginning, all of the gods have reached their full potential and have expanded beyond all limits. They have become so powerful that they have transcended time and space, breaking free from the bounds of their respective universes and entering the realm of the multiverse.As the gods move through the multiverse, they continue to create new verses and expand their realms. They create life in all its forms, experimenting with new concepts and ideas, always seeking to push the boundaries of existence.In this age, the gods have become so powerful that they can shape reality to their will, altering and creating Outerverses with a mere thought. They form alliances, engage in epic battles, and explore realms beyond imagining, all in an effort to continue their quest for dominance and mastery.As the gods move through the
Omniverse
, they encounter new challenges and discoveries, facing foes they never thought possible and unlocking secrets they never knew existed. They continue to evolve and grow, pushing the limits of their own power and expanding the boundaries of existence itself.In this age, the gods have become the defining force of all things, shaping reality to their will at their potential and forging the ultimate destiny of all existence. They are the beginning(no not actually The Sigma is the Superior still), the end, and everything in between, their power and influence echoing across the vast expanse of the
Omniverse
but wait there's more..
