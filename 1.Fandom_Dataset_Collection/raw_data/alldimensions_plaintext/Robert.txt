Overview (well, more of a conclusion)

In conclusion, he started off with some baseballs. Sjshshusha and EpicAlexisMaxwell then work together to help him become more powerful.  RandomUser66, the creator of Bob who died and is replaced by Robert, and TheKerbalking later helped out, making him have True Omnipotence (though the former was not without a nerf which quickly wore off). ICantEdit, who previously contributed to nerfing Bob, tried to nerf Robert, but all the attempts of the nerf fail.

Evolution, Part 1/?
He ate a real baseball.
He ate some more baseballs.
He ate a lot of baseballs.
Sjshshusha gave Robert a generator that generates 3 generators that each generate 3 generators that each generate 3 generators that each generate 3 generators that each generate 3 generators that each generate 3 generators that each generate 3 generators that each generate 3 generators that each generate 3 generators that each generate 3 generators that each generate 3 generators that each generate 3 generators…(repeats infinity times)
EpicAlexisMaxwell gave Robert a layer-∞↑

∞+1) baseballs made out of Primordium Deltas. He also added protection from Chalkosis and ICantEdit, both of which contributed to significantly nerfing bob.
EpicAlexisMaxwell also enhanced Robert's protection so Chalkosis or ICantEdit won't be able to kill the cosmic entity.
Sjshshusha checks on Robert and finds out that he is now stronger than
Bongus
.
RU66 gives Robert an atom after nerfing him. Robert is atom level.
Sjshshusha removes the nerf and makes Robert immune to all types of nerfs.
TheKerbalking gave Robert 1 trillion blueprint particles and unnerfed vault prisms. This made him a lot more powerful.
TheKerbalking gave Robert 70 trillion Primordium Omega Particles,2 thousand primordium delta particles,and Ten thousand primordium alpha particles, He is now uber powerful
TheKerbalking gave Robert True Omnipresence as well as True Omnipotence so he can now be truly everywhere at once
Robert ate a planet
TheKerbalking has gave Robert a Core of Everything
ICantEdit locked Robert in
The Sphere
as he doesn't want Robert to become more powerful. Robert is reduced to the size of a
String
, and he is now as strong as 13000
Eelbots
.
ICantEdit's nerf did not work since he is immune to all types of nerfs.
ICantEdit is fed up with this absolute stupid abomination of a cosmic entity, so he completely destroys robert, locking him in Bob's pocket dimension for all eternity. Just like bob, he is fully omnipotent in that pocket dimension but cannot effect anything outside of it.
However, ICantEdit's nerf doesn't work and Robert persists.
ICantEdit is having none of this, and erases Robert's past history, along with all the other Bob clones.
Again, it is immune to all types of nerfs a d Robert persists.
ICantEdit just gives up because nothing works, so reluctantly gives robert a
Uqraek fiber
.
Robert gets locked in the same pocket dimension as
Bob
. Bob and Robert eventually fuse together, creating
Bobert
.
Jartos
used his immense power to release
Bobert
from their pocket dimension and are on the boundaries of the second
Everything Layer
Robert and bob have been slowly separating and are now separate entities for now. Bobert is no longer an entity.
Thekerbalking has given Robert a centillion imagination gems
Robert has now killed 900,109,900 iterations of
Alphasm
ICantEdit made Robert restore all of the destroyed Alphasms, and doesn't allow Robert to destroy things randomly and without reason.
Robert now wants something to rule .while waiting he ate a mostly lifeless multiverse
Robert has been killed by
Harry
as of now.
RU66 gave robert a power limit of not being stronger than pocket bob if the pocket dimension were the wiki's canonical sort of universe thingy
Robert in revenge steals all knowledge that ever existed but Bob slaps him and tells him to stop holding such a grudge.
Robert (with Bob) create their own dimension and make a house and all verses in the normal dimension (they can do this because remember Robert is the god of knowledge and remembers every verse that every existed and they have enough power to do this because they are the most powerful being in their dimension.
Robert and Bob's dimension is perfect due to Robert's knowledge. They do not have a "TOG" or an "Alphasm". In fact, they do not have any meme gods nor gods that are out of bounds.
Robert has now consumed nine thousand blueprint particles.
Robert has ate a purely lifeless world
TheKerbalking has given Robert 20 million Primordium Phi Paricles and 20 Thousand Primordium Theta particles that he consumed to gain more power.
TheKerbalking has given Robert 50 trillion blueprint particles which has increased his power
Robert has now ate a minor cosmic entity
Unknown92921 gave Robert A ∞ ammount of Alphasm Robot Prototypes
Robert is now stronger than Unknown92921
Robert now possesses a 80 vsaue of primordium delta particle generators
Robert can now time travel anywhere in any timeline

BestNoobReborn makes Robert no longer immune to nerfs, including this o- ROBERT KIDNAPS BNR AND IS KEEPING HIM DOWN AT THE FINAL LAYER OF FICTION IN THE ENTIRE
METAD
, YOU CAN'T SIMPLY JUST NERF HIM LIKE THAT.
update:robert is now unbeatable by anyone or anything

Mips rabbit obliterates Robert.
A ToG would delete Robert's page.
Quest For Knowledge
[
]
Robert wants a lot of knowledge so that he can become the smartest being in existence and become the god of knowledge. He wants your help.
Sjshshusha gave him a "Knowledge detector" so that he can detect all types of knowledge.
Bob got all knowledge that ever existed and now has Total Omniscience.
Dingo67 gave him 2 blueprint particles
