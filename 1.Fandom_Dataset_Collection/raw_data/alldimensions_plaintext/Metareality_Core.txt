A
Metareality Core
is an indeterminately sized core containing all of the infinite information regarding its local
Metareality-Web
.
On the inside of the core is an infinite library containing all information of the web its contained in. It's destruction would cause an implosion of all of its Metareality-web and their
Eraser
,
Pencil
and
Paper
would promptly explode, which would likely open a hole in their
Table
causing
the Shadow
to be free if the latter was in the web where this happened.
A Metareality core's energy causes matter around it to chaotically swirl around it, this is because of its huge concentration of
Primordium Delta
, approximately 92%! The rest of it's composition is of small
Information Bubbles
containing information about laws of physics, matter, and other necessary details. Again, much like a library, these bubbles are much like books and are organised in sections.
Papers are in fact directly linked to their cores. Any information the 'realitators' within the Papers get, will be directly sent to their Metareality Core to then be sent to be changed to their Metareality-Web.
