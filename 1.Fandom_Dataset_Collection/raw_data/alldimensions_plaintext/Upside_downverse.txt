The Upside downverse is a verse where everything is upside-down.
In the Upside downverse, everything has an "up" and a "down". Usually, these two areas are chosen randomly by the Upside downverse itself. Facing "up" means having your "up" face away from the exact center point of the verse, and facing "down" is the opposite of that.
A few civilizations exist within the Upside downverse. They have rarely gotten into conflict with each other, due to how warfare is nigh impossible in it.

Glitchonicite
present in the
Madnessverse
, the Upside downverse's containing verse.
