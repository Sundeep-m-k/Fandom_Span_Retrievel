Polyverses
are verses that exist in rare places in special
universes
.
Our universe
is one such example. Think of polyverses like our universe's version of
milliverses
. Every universe that supports milliverses can't support polyverses, and vice versa. Most (99.8%) polyverses are just a few millimeters wide. However, some polyverses are larger than an african elephant, the largest known one being the size of Mount Everest. A recognizable feature of polyverses are their cubical shape. Polyverses also  have shrink and grow rings inside them. These allow the observer inside to see the many subverses inside, all of which also have grow and shrink rings. The only way to enter and exit polyverses is to be at the polyverses scale level, and your only way to change scale level is bey shrink or grow rings. All polyverses have a scale level of -5, just like all other verses outside. Weirdly, grow rings decrease your scale level while shrink rings increase it.

Etymology
[
]
Polyverses get their name from their cubical shape, making them classifiable as low poly in a loose sense. "Low poly" as a term itself is based on the word "polygon."
Sub-verses
[
]
Polyverses have many sub-verses inside. These subverses are visible nowhere else.
Fractaloverses
[
]
Fractaloverses are by far the most common subverses in polyverses. In some small polyverses, they are the only subverses. For most polyverses, 99.92% of subverses are Fractaloverses. They range from a millionth to a ten-millionth of the size of the polyverse they are contained in, and have a scale level of 0. While containing many unique areas, they do not have any sub verses. They are very slow and stable. For more information, see
Fractaloverse
.
Versal Discs
[
]
Versal discs are rather flat verses that range from 2 to 5 meters and are also at scale level -5, just like the polyverses that contain them. Just like how milliverses contain
microverses
, polyverses contain versal discs. Versal discs are like a polyverse's version of microverses. They are the only polyversal subverse that have subverses of their own. They move quite fast and collide a lot. They make up 0.07% of subverses in most polyverses.
Pneumoverses
[
]
The core of a pneumoverse.
Pneumoverses are gas-filled subverses in polyverses that make up 0.01% of subverses in polyverses. They are scale level -5 and glow like a star from the outside due to their center being a hotspot for nuclear fusion, just like stars. They range from 30 to 100 meters in size. Not much else is known about them.
Collisions
[
]
Collisions depend entirely on the relative speed of the two polyverses involved, but they can cause large events like supernovas if fast enough.
Slow
[
]
Collisions of a thousandth to a hundredth of the polyverse's size are considered slow. The polyverses merge gradually with not much happening.
Medium
[
]
Collisions of a hundredth to a tenth of the polyverse's size are considered medium. Many subverses are expelled, which then instantly explode in a mini supernove due to no longer being in a polyverse. These are quite visible, due to the explosions.
Fast
[
]
Collisions faster than a tenth of the polyverse's size are considered fast. Much more subverses are expelled, causing lots of light emitting-explosions before the large explosion cause by the instability of the resulting omniverse. These explosions were just though to be supernovas up until a few decades ago.
