About

The people living in this verse are called stringites. They are far more advanced than humans and are alot stronger than humans too. They look like green stickfigures. The only reason this verse has life is because the stringites found out how to make a big LED light for a sun to keep the string from being a cold wasteland. The underside of this verse is home to a cosmic entity that destroys anything made on the underside of this verse and that is why the underside of the string has been at a population of 0-8 ever since a few quadrillion years ago when the cosmic entity was found destroying all civilization on the underside of this verse. Most beings in this verse are green or blue and can be found on earth but not in that color. This verse is held together by a substance called Stringium, this substance is almost completely invincible and is why the string isnt destroyed instantly.
