Grammar
[
]
Ghozna is an relatively isolating language and uses the nominative-accusative alignment. Case marking is shown through changing of vowels in a word or via particles.
Sentence structure is SOV, and adjectives go after the thing they're describing. There is no difference between adverbs and adjectives in Ghozna.
Case Marking
[
]
To show that the verb happens, you have to add "tha" to the end of the verb, for example: "Jra chuztha", "I contain"/"I am in". There are a few special cases where it is different, such as for "rith", "see"; instead of adding "tha" to the end of "rith", you just add an "a" instead. If "tha" is not added to a verb, the verb is implied to may have happened, for example: "Jra qhoqghtha" = "I live", "Jra qhoqgh" = "I might live"/"I might've lived" (depending on context). Tha can also be suffixed onto adjectives only done when a verb is needed, as well as onto nouns to show that the noun exists.
Negation
[
]
To show that the action does not happen, you take the verb, remove the "tha" if there is a tha, and place "yoth" (no) after the verb. For example, "I live" = "Jra qhoqghtha", "I don't live" = "Jra qhoqgh yoth". Again, "yoth" can also be used to act as an adjective to a noun to show that it doesn't exist.
Nominative/Accusative Case/Passive Voice
[
]
To show accusative case, you change all the single vowels of the word to 'o', for example, the accusative form of "daqgh" (land) is "doqgh".
This also used to show passive voice, for example: "Jra choth sojtha" = "I eat you", "Jro chath sojtha" = "I am eaten by you". If in the case that all the single vowels in the word are o or dipthongs, then suffix o to the word. In the case that the word that is in passive voice is already in the accusative form, the verb will get all forms of nominative marking. For example, "Jra doj sajtha sojtha" = "I eat the thing that is eaten"; "sajtha" = nominative form of "sojtha" (meaning eat)
Adjectives can also be marked for this when they describe something that is in the accusative case, although this is usually optional.
Showing nominative case is optional, although if you want to mark words for nominative case you replace all the single vowels with 'a'.
Genitive/Locative Case
[
]
Genitive/locative case is shown via "chuz". The word that is performing the genitive/locative action is treated as the object, and chuz is added as an adjective to that word. For example, "I eat" = "jra sojtha", "I eat in the house" = "jra kaisho chuz sojtha".
Perfective and Imperfective Aspect
[
]
To show perfective aspect, you change all the single vowels of the word to the dipthong 'oi', for example, the perfective form of "rith" (see) is "roith". Imperfective is the same as the habitual case, and the habitual case is pretty much completely unmarked.
Comparative Phrases
[
]
In a comparative phrase, to show that one thing is more/less [adjective] than another, you first describe the thing with adjectives, and then take the thing that is being compared to the first thing and add "yoth" to the end of it.
