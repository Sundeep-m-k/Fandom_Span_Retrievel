Introduction
[
]
The
Windowsverse
is one of lots of
Operationverses
, and the biggest of all of them. Its one of the biggest things that a
Computerverse
can contain. Weirdly, there are a lot of existing Windowsverses, each one being more modern and effective than the previous one. Also,
Virusverses
can attack these Windowsverses, and can even affect an entire ComputerVerse, making it unable to be used. Its recommended to avoid those types of verses at all cost. Fortunately, the more recent the Windowsverses are, the less probable a Virusverse could attack it.
