The
Omniverse of Reality
is a type of verse that contains
Archverses of Reality
. They consist of fractals that contain the formerly mentioned structure over and over again. There is a huge core at the center of these fractals, which gives light to their entire Omniverses of Reality.
There is a ton of life that live within the fractals. However, it is extremely primitive compared to the other life in the Archverses of Reality,
Hyperverses of Reality
,
Megaverses of Reality
, and so on.
The dimensionality is ridiculous. No creature can survive outside of the fractals, since if they saw the impossible dimensions, they would die instantly due to shock. This applies to EVERY creature, including cosmic entities and even some
Omni-Gods
.
The shape of the Omniverses of Reality is unknown, because if you were to follow the fractals deeper and deeper, they would keep getting smaller and smaller, therefore not letting you reach the edge. However, it is possible to clip out of them by switching existence states infinitely fast and moving out of it at infinite speeds.
Omniverses of Reality can either be contained by
Barrels of Reality
or
Nested Infinities
. Each of these chains from these verses have their own verses, with the two branches merging at
the Waterfalls
. Our Omniverse of Reality is contained by a
Nested Infinity
, with the extended -verse of Reality chain (
Barrel of Reality
to
Mandelbrotverse of Reality
) only being discovered after exploration of our Waterfall.
