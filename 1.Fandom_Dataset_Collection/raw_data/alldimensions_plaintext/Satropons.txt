These are bubbles filled with "all-seeing" eyes.
The Eyes
[
]
The eyes inside a Satropon cannot see for infinite distances, but the distance in which they can see is too big to be properly comprehended, and cannot be easily distinguished from infinite vision. A test conducted in 610
OYC
proved that an eye in a Satropon had an eyesight score of
20
/
7.8525
âˆ’

{\displaystyle 20/7.8525^{-16}}
.
The eyes vary in size, with some being up to 62100 LY large and others being just 2 feet large. The eyes are almost always colored white, but eyes can also be gray, blue, brown, orange, yellow, or just clear.
The amount of eyes in a Satropon are usually between 10,000 to 40,000,000.
Usage of the Eyes
[
]
Most Satropons have advanced civilizations in them, and they use the eyes in the verse as a way to see unimaginable distances. Due to this, they are extremely proficient at astronomy, and know an absurd amount of information about verses far beyond the
Dokaverse
. The eyes have also been used to spot enemy forces up to extreme distances, and have allowed these civiizations to plan an escape or build up their defenses.
As a result, invasions carried out on the civilizations in a Satropon are rarely successful.
