The
Bxx
is when a
Bxo
reaches the Extreme stage and a Boxnova occurs. The cause of its explosion may be a type above the ω
Sproyong
, or it may be a large number of ω Sproyongs heading towards it to cause the Boxnova. This explosion can also be caused when another box is joined by this box that has arrived. It reaches its maximum stage and causes a massive explosion as they melt together. Sometimes, a bxx has time to corrupt even more and becomes a
xoB
, xoBs are mainly created by
ZMDE
when he corrupts bxxs more.
The Meltation of
Primition
[
]
This event is known as the melting of the
Primitions
, as their melting leads to the disintegration of existence, and this explosion leads to the creation of a hole in the
Omnipyramid
,
but the Omnipyramid repairs
that hole after a few OYC. When the
Primitions
melt, they turn into True Nothing (True), and this is the difference between The Bxx and
The Bxo
.
