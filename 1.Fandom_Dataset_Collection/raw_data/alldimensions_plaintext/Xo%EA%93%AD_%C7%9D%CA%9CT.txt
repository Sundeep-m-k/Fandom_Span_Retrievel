ƨǝxoꓭ are the opposite of
the Boxes
, so instead of
containing
everything that exists and doesn't exist, they're
contained
by everything that exists and doesn't exist.
Anything smaller than ƨǝxoꓭ is unobservable to anything inside of
the Glitch Spaces
. They also have their polar equivalent, known as the
Anti-Boxes
.
ƨǝxoꓭ have infinitely many layers, each of which defines the existence state of objects in the previous layer. The first layer of ƨǝxoꓭ allows
ζ
to change existence state to phase through anything.
These layers contain a extremely tiny version of "reverse imaginary photons" from the
Poleverses
that probably fell out of
Trees of Order
and ended up in the soil all the way down here. The size of said reverse imaginary photons is 0. The smallest thing that can't be classified as a number, but can be used in place of a number in cases where the thing won't contradict itself and be a number, is XE. There are XE reverse imaginary photons in the first layer, XE^2 in the next layer, XE^3 in the layer after that, and so on.
The reverse imaginary photons exist, because they take electromagnetic radiation from inside
ζ
, and de-amplify it to amounts that can be used to transfer information (via energy) within xoꓭ ǝʜT.
ƨǝxoꓭ have commonly been harvested for the reverse imaginary photons within it, due to the fact that they can asorb almost every force, and the fact that they work at extremely small levels.
