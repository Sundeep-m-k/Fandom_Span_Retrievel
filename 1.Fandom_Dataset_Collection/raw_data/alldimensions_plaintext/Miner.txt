Miners
(Alternatively: Mining drills) are machines developed by
Automate Industries
that mine minerals automatically. They can mine most ores like copper, iron, stone, coal, nickel, silver and more. They always need some sort of power, be it in the form of fuel or electricity. They have to be placed over a patch of ores, where they will start to mine them out and output them.
