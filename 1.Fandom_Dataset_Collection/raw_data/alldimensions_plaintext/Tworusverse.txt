A
Tworusverse
is the beginning of the Torus Chain. It has similar properties to a
toriverse
, but because it is in a higher dimension, it is shaped like a 5-torus instead of a 3-torus. The tworusverse's surface is actually a grid of
Hencentroverses
, folded into a manifold. which acts a lot like spacetime. It allows for wormholes, which was used as a first
transport into these kinds of verses.
Properties
[
]
Tworusverses are unique because their inside does not contain much of anything, unless holes in Hencentroverses leak
moquarks
into them. If that happens, the physics inside tworusverses will attract each other and fuse the moquarks, creating large amounts of heat and making large balls of fusing moquarks. This is usually called a möbistar, and although rare, they are the dominant source of energy in the Torus Chain, and they make space look white from the amount of light they produce.

A Möbistar, which emits very large amounts of light.
