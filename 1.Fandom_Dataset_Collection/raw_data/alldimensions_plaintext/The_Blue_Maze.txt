The Green Mazes
It's been boring so far, but do not worry, this is the last type of
maze
. It is blue because where there should be
void
between the
Green Mazes
, there is water instead. Due to other unique features, the Blue Mazes are also knosn as the "
Waterstar Mazes
".
And even more so, there is a very hard ice shell under the water of these mazes which is nearly impenetrable and noted for its nearly unnatural smoothness. The ice also seems to have tons of Green Mazes ingrained in it, with the ice and mazes going deep as the core, which holds some sort of beyond solid. The core is heavily studied and only 0.01% of the
Blue Mazes
.
There has been reported instances of Blue Mazes ironically not being
blue
, but most of the time the color isn't too different. For example, cyan / light blue / dark blue / etc. are some of the alternative colors seen in Blue Mazes.
