The
Transcendent multiverses
are the next level up from the
Transcendent universes
. We don't know much about them just like the formers, but here is some information (Not everything is confirmed):
They have (Ω.5)~ Transcendent universes inside them on average.
One thing we are completely sure of is that in the core of the Transcendent multiverses, a modified Transcendent universe can be found. Further information regarding them can be seen
some paragraphs below
.
No one has ever fully seen these
verses
, making it impossible to give an actual photo of them, at least for now. The best we have are two conceptual images, which are shown in the infobox.
With regards to its dimensionality, the only clue we have is that it's a lot bigger than the dimensionality of the Transcendent universe.
Our Transcendent multiverse has some
rogue
planets
with
life
within it, but the life we do know of is very insignificant, consisting of only some cosmic
species
of bacterias. Thus, we may need to wait millions of
OYC
to actually see something beautiful(?) or at least interesting emerge, such as a
civilization
.
Multranscendium
A concept, nothing interesting. But it looks like Lesser Ü.

Multranscendium
[
]
The
Multranscendium
is the name of the cores of the Transcendent multiverses. It's like a Transcendent universe but bigger and with higher temperatures. It also has a completely different appearance compared to the others.
Its temperature is Ω times hotter than the core of a Transcendent Universe (Transcendium), making it impossible for Transcendent universes and other verses to get near it.
Similar to other Transcendent verses we don't have an actual picture, only a concept image.
