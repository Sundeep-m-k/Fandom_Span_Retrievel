The
universe
that both contains the empty posiverse and the negaverse, their strong gravity makes it necessary for the Zeroverse to sustain itself. The zeroverse is only four times the size of the posiverse and the negaverse
The Zeroverse is part of the setverses being the first of the setverses it is the smallest and the least void. The omegaverse is the end of life itself.
The oneverse is what contains the zero verse and it is around 8 times larger (420 Trillion LY), the twoverse is 8 times larger than the one verse ( 3,360 Trillion LY), the three verse is again 8 times larger ( 27,820 Trillion LY) and so on.
Life in the Zeroverse and the other setverses

Life in the zeroverse is weird, they are comlarmerations of gas rather than the normal life that we know. This gas is 5d and though it is casual it is still so hard to relate to the other types of life in the multiverse.
