List of Polyhedra by Type
Truncated polyhedra are
regular polyhedra
in which the
vertices
have been cut and replaced with additional
faces
.
As the cut becomes deeper, the areas of the new faces become greater and further into the shape and the areas of the remaining faces become smaller. If the "cut" is "deep" enough, the new faces can come out of the other side of the shape, creating quasitruncated shapes.
Convex

Truncated Cube
Convex truncated polyhedra are easy to understand, since they are just the platonic solids with the vertices cut off.
Truncated Tetrahedron
Truncated Cube
Truncated Octahedron
Truncated Dodecahedron
Truncated Icosahedron
Concave
[
]
Concave truncated polyhedra are truncated polyhedra that intersect themselves.
