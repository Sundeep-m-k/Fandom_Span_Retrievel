The
Underneathverse
is a special hierarchy that sits "underneath" every regular verse in the hierarchy, acting as a sort of parallel hierarchy. The Underneathverse serves no true purpose, and was just used by
Alphasm
to experiment with different Hierarchical Tunnels.
It is thought that many more verses just like the Underneathverse exist, but have just not been found yet.
How to Enter
[
]
The only way to enter is to somehow break through the
Hierarchical Tunnel
that is
TOH
and enter into the Hierarchical Tunnel that is the Underneathverse. This is a ridiculously hard task to do, with many insisting that it is utterly impossible.
Relationship with TOH
[
]
The Underneathverse and The Official Hierarchy are parallel to each other, meaning that they will never intercept each other. They are also infinitely far apart, due to many verses in TOH being infinitely sized.
