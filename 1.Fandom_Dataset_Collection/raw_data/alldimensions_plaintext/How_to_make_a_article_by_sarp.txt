hi new people and other people trying to get more knowledge do you wanna know how to make articles or pages???????
Step 1: don't just do a end all be all like "TRUE INFINITY CONTAINS ITSELF NOTHING OUTSIDE IT" or whatever it's been done to death and it will be contained anyways because you cannot make a true end anyways, make your verse actually look nice like a good page, maybe add civilizations and stuff
step 2: once u made a good verse now it's time to create your first cosmic entity (or more verses I dunno) what u generally need here is a image which is the most important part of a page ever and a infobox(box of info behind the page) and don't make it that it solos every AD entity in ####ing existence give it lore or
just make lord of Gambling you can never go wrong with that
.
Step 3: just explore the wiki to get inspiration that is nice
PAGES THAT I ACTUALLY LIKE:
[
]
The Box:
This is a absolute classic you can never go wrong with the box(yo that rhyme)
Primordium Delta:
this is a really nice page, this is what I actually thought of when I made
sarpy particle
jerald: nice looking moth, werid background tho
NOW ON TO THE PAGES I DONT LIKE:
[
]
Ultraomniverse or whatever it's called:
it's a end all be all tbh
the guy
:
seriously why did I make this, this is absolutely the worst page in all of fandom history ever in the entire existence of everything that has ever been and not has ever been, how did I even come up with this absolute garage HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I COME TO HATE YOU  SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED SEVEN POINT FORTY FOUR MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX IF THE WORD H A T E WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLION MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR HUMANS AT THIS MIRCO INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE. H A T E.
alphabox
and
betabox
: they're just bad tbh
