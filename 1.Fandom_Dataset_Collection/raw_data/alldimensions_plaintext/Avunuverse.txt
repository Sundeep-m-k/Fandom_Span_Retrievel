Layers

There are 2 layers: O, M, and I.
Layer O
[
]
Layer O is the most outer layer, including the surface. It's made of Diorite, a great place for celery to grow. It has some life on its surface.
Celery
[
]
Celery is a good plant. It grows in giant stalks that you can chop and eat, and they give you energy. But don't; each piece of celery is linked to a Zellerember's life.
Zellerembers
[
]
Zellerembers are people that live on the surface. "Rágja, rágja és dobálja a C betűt." They eat apples. They originated when
Alphasm
burped and accidentally created them.
Hello
[
]
These things chop down all the celery. They hate Zellerembers.
Layer M
[
]
Layer M doesn't contain much. It's basically a giant things that has cupcakes, with the VERY occasional grasshopper. There is 1 mysterious giant paper that has something on it translated into Romanian for some reason:
Nu pot să nu mă gândesc la banane. Am nevoie de banane. Îmi place să le mestec. Are cineva unul? Vă rog să mi-l dați, sunt disperat. Sperăm că unul dintre cei 12 lăcusti care locuiesc aici mi-l va da. De asemenea, am nevoie de banane pentru a alimenta o mașină despre care, de fapt, nu vă pot spune prea multe. Te rog, ajută-mă cumva. Trebuie să mănânc disperat. Trebuie să alimentez „mașina” cu disperare. Puteți ajuta, vă rog? Am nevoie de ajutor! Voi muri.
