What are theta structures made out of?
[
]
The most known theta structure. It is called a Crystal Theta Structure, probably because it has a crystal shapes.
A theta stucture is made out of a few
A
's and one oversized

. A Theta structure is like an animal, but even smaller than an atom, actually, even smaller than a
Β
! It uses the oversized wait lets just call it a box. It uses the oversized box to store energy in there. The A's are the things controlling it, but they are really attached so it wont really move.
How do they get energy?
[
]
They get energy be absorbing
A
's and they normally eat at the lines of it, making it go to the box, so it can eat more.
Fun Fact
[
]
The second most known structure, called a Complex Theta Structure.
The least known (surprisingly) structure, called a Simple Theta Structure
Fact: If you split a theta structure, you would make a chemical reaction.

{\displaystyle \ce{Th + F -> A + L+ -> Th+ -> SB + A- }}
SB = Small B | L = Line | Th = Theta Structure | F = Force.  The reason this happens is when it gets a force more then 100 ly/s then, it will split into an A and the line gets over charged by the force, and normally they are together so it goes together and makes a theta structure and then that has too much energy it creates a very small b from the a's and a few lines make the outer but then one A stays left. This is only for the least known structure.
