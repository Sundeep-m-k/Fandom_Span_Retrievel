A metapoint is a particle around the size of a
Blueprint Particle
, and is formed when a
Preprimordium Particle
collides with
â¬¤
. They cannot be divided into any other particle, they simply will split into 2 smaller versions of the original point.
Properties

Metapoints contain an infinite amount of themselves, leading them to be undivisble. They change shape every couple of femtoseconds. Metapoints can get infinitely small, although they violently self-destruct after 3-4 subdivisions.
Metapoints have a mass, and they can create "meta" objects, or objects that change their existance rank. Entities made of metapoints are noted to be extremely unstable and will sometimes just collapse into a
Blueprint Particle
.
Never pick a fight with a meta-entity. - Professor Will
Touching a metaobject can also create
Causality Paradoxes
, in which a future version of yourself makes you touch the metaobject, and then you become your future self. This temporal looping property means a "infinity bomb" could be created, where it detonates itself over and over, causing endless destruction. Scientists studying Metapoints have sworn to never create such a weapon.
