Plastic Factory
The
Plastic Company
is a company that owns all of the
Plastic Factories
in
The Box
. The company is said to be as old as The Box is, however, some believe that the Plastic Company is even older yet. For this very reason, the Plastic Company has flaws which make it prone to having important files that make the Plastic Factories work becoming hacked (see incidents below).
Incidents
[
]
About 10^900 OYC ago, some files that operated the machines in the Plastic Factories were corrupted by a hacker. The hacking was done due to backends in the way that
Omniversal Waves
operate. The servers went from
Omni2Security
to
Omni2Security+
, the newest one at the time.
