The
Avoidance Zone
is a kind of
verse
that takes on the form of a zone for
Sarpagons
and
Super Sarpagons
. It is also the last class 31 verse in the
hierarchy
and is therefore the terminator of said class.
About
[
]
The Avoidance Zones stretch across the
void
in a grid-like pattern that seemingly goes on past the limits of 'forever' & occupies the area that the Sarpagon-like structures take up, although that amount is negligible by the Avoidance Zones' vast and expansive nature, in which it is relative to the largest Sarpagon-like structure there is, existing in their Avoidance Zone.
The lack of life and
entities
directly living in the Avoidance Zone indicates that they're a death barrier to those below and at Sarpagon-level, as the temperature inside the Avoidance Zone fries entities that can't resist it.
The Red Light
[
]
The Avoidance Zones have a light source, which is usually red, that gets more saturated in the middle/center of the Avoidance Zones, so it has an origin. However, getting to the origin is impossible since when even after travelling Œ© light years/s for Œ© seconds (burali forti version), the origin might already be away further than expected, and without indication (change of saturation), the task proves to be infeasible to accomplish.
This is the only way to escape the Avoidance Zones and go beyond them. Outside the Avoidance Zones lies structures in the
32nd class
of the hierarchy (at the moment, no class 32 verses exist yet), which is also the last class of the hierarchy this verse is in as a whole.
Trivia
[
]
This
page
uses Sarpagon as a base to expand upon (and therefore not make it be a stub).
The original image was (and still is) first used for an entity in an unrelated wiki. Its purpose is to be a background for the entity.
This is the second page
he
has made.
This article may get updated to reflect towards being a
class terminator
in the future, but for now, it'll remain as a normal 31st-class verse.
This verse has been updated to be the class 31 terminator.
This verse is classified as the hottest verses in the wiki
