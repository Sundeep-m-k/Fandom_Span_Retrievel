The
primidial godity spaces
are the last
verses
of the
22th class
, not including the
final chain
. They're quite disappointing though, specially considering their place in the
Post-hierarchy
.
Despite that, they have some of the prettiest
rogue
planets
ever appareance-wise, making this type of godity space one of the most beautiful places in our
wikiverse
to look at. Information about them isnt really vast.
Here, tons of
primidial beyond godities
live, hence the name of this type of verse. The formers also sometimes create new primidial godity spaces, and ours is an example of that.
