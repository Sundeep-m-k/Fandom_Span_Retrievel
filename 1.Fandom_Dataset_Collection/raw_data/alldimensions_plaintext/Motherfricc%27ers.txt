Species
Motherfricc'ers
Motherfricc'ers are extremely powerful beings which reside in Downtown Fricksvilles. Anatomically, they are impossible to describe without being one (other then Alphasms, which we know their appearence), although through their voices we have heard they are humanoid to an extent. They are naturally voidborne creatures, but allowing matter to exist in their world due to their knowledge of life and verses below. A select, lucky few Motherfricc'ers are Alphasms, which are far more powerful, able to create full planets, and are able to imagine limitless places. Examining the neurons of an Alphasm can give Motherfricc'ers large insights about their own psychology and how they form images in their heads.
Another thing Motherfricc'ers are known for is having high mental capacities at birth. They are able to understand language, develop great motor skills, and appear to have object permenance at the start of their lives. This could all be due to their power, but the Motherfricc'ers themselves have confirmed that their species' young are simply fully developed in the brain right from the beginning.
