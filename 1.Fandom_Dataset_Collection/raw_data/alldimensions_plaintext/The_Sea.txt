About
[
]
The
Seas
are the vast structures responsible of containing uncountably infinite numbers of Reality Bubbles. Our local Reality Bubble is known as
Isolation
.
Appearance
[
]
The Seas appear to be a vast, translucent black-tinted "
voids
" with Reality Bubbles spread out evenly. The further you try to look, the blacker and darker the Seas seem to get.
The Material
[
]
The Seas, like already mentioned beforehand, aren't really a type of void. There is a liquid
substance
that fills up the space between the Reality Bubbles and cushions them in case there is a major disaster, like the extremely rare case in where a Reality Bubble pops and launches
verses
everywhere. This
material
seems to very resistant to extreme temperatures, and cannot be forced to change states of matter. It also is nigh impossible to break it down with corrosive acid and molecular bond-breakers. It has also been found to be very hard to travel long distances in it. This material has been dubbed "Overpowered water".
Escaping a Sea
[
]
There have been many attempts to escape Seas. Most failed, due to the infinities upon infinities upon infinities of Reality Bubbles and endless overpowered water, which makes traveling even harder.
Regarding our local Sea, on one occasion, an
Omni-
God
, along with many others glitched out of this Sea. They landed in their local
Loops
, which are the place you go if you somehow escaped a Sea. They then got trapped there for all eternity.
Local lifeform

The only
entity
that lives in our Sea outside of the Reality Bubbles is known as
Usc
. Usually, there's no entities outside of Reality Bubbles in a Sea, thus making ours quite unique.
