A “The Star”
"The Stars" is very small compared to the cosmic regions with the biggest one being only about 5 kms, and smallest one 835 meters in size.
Why "The Stars" are smaller than Neutron stars.

"The Stars" are made of a substance similar made from supermassive black holes and Quasi/Black hole Stars. This matter when squeezed to small sizes, can turn so dense, some "The Stars" have gravity stronger than black holes, with gravity about
∞
2 in some stars.
Why very few "The stars" exist.

Like I said before, "The Stars" have enormous GRAVITY, so much, that most "stars" collapse under their own weight and gravity, releasing ultra-supernovas which can destroy entire solar systems if one is within 1.7 light years.
Also, "The Stars" have their own class, named, "TH CLASS".
