The Apex is a large construct resembling a 5d tetrahedron which will teleport a random verse into its center for roughly 3 Earth days before it is released. 4 Earth days later, the Apex will teleport another verse to its center, continuing the process.
The Apex, if it teleported a verse bigger than it into itself, it will grow much bigger to accommodate for the verse's size (The Apex will not shrink once it has released the verse). This has allowed it to effectively escape that verse and continue to grow bigger. It is unknown when it will become larger than
Omniverse
, its current containing verse.
There have been times when the Apex teleported its containing verse into itself, effectively destroying the verse from the inside as the Apex burst apart the verse apart when it grew bigger, eventually ripping apart the verse's barrier.
The Apex, unlike other objects such as
The Lego
and
The Verse Trap
, is a natural object and was not created through artificial means.
The Apex currently has 6 extremely powerful entities living inside it, which include
Apex
,
Oracle
, and a few more.
