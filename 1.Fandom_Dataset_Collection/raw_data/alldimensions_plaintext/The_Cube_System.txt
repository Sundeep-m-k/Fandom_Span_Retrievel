The
Cube System
is a complex of various cubes of many dimensions, having all types of cubes in infinite quantities. Cosmic Eyes reside on the lower-dimensional cubes as well, having infinite amounts of them per side in some cases. Other cubes tend to hold random elements or environments on their faces, such as plains, deserts, forests, and more. Because the center of the
Tesseract System
is believed to contain vast deposits of undiscovered compounds,
Real People
and
Daves
have tried to escape the Cube System, but so far, all attempts have failed.

Attempt 1
[
]
This attempt was performed by a
Dave
after discovering the vast mineral deposits. The Dave lached on to a
Cosmic Eye
and started propelling himself with a
The Omni Computer Room
but hit a dimensional biome smaller than that Dave, so he suffocated to death.
Attempts 2-91

After they escaped
Name Not Found
, several
Real People
had tried to escape the Cube System in a shuttle, but they died halfway through from radiation sickness.
Attempt 92
[

This was the most recent attempt, also by a Real Person, this time riding on a modified clone of
Scalene
. They too died of radiation sickness 75% through, and the Scalene clone has since been delivered to The Hyperstarian National Museum of Negative-Size Verses and Entities]].
