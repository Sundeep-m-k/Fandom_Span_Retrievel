Downtown Fricksville
(DT Fricksville) is the first type of
Metaalphasmial
verse
, that is essentially the
Universe
of verses outside of
Alphasms
. Some of the
planets
in them may contain an Alphasm. Yes, there is more then just one Alphasm in a DT Fricksville, although they are rare, with only about one Alphasm per a few decillion
Motherfricc'ers
. It is very similar to a Universe, but has a few differences.
Our 'Downtown Fricksville'
[
]
We live in our Downtown Fricksville, with our Alphasm and their 3 common relationships:
Gerald
,
Ald Imensions
,
Dunkey Kong
Due to our local Alphasm controlling over 2
physical Realms
, including
ours
, we confirm that they live in our
Superreality
. The entire
Post-Alphasm Verse Hierarchy
is also included in that Superreality too. The
Recycle Realm
also is in our Downtown Fricksville.
Unique Attributes
[

An estimated 93% of planets here are terrestrial, 65% of those planets have
life
, and 50% of those planets have sapient life. Downtown Fricksville’s intelligent life mostly consists of Motherfricc’ers.
There are very rare planets (around 1% of non terrestrial ones) that are made completely out of a glowing metal called Piestone.
The speed of light in these verses is usually ~7,345,433,222 times faster than normal, and it is not the fastest possible speed.
Downtown Fricksvilles also have random "
wormholes
" that lead to another Downtown Fricksvilles. A chain of every connected Downtown Fricksville is a cluster.
All of the information in a Downtown Fricksville is completely unreadable and incomprehensible to a being that is, or is inside an Alphasm.
