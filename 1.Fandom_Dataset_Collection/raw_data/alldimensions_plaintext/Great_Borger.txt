Great Borgers are also naturally created by huge McDonald's workers. Yep, we're a speck within a giant McDonald's. These Great Borgers are also attacked by the customers of the giant McDonald's, as they eat the Great Borgers. However, if a civilization is advanced enough to colonize a Borger, they can fire at the customers, making their local Borger float away.
Finally, each sesame seed, tomato, onion, and everything else in the borger is a huge collection of dyed Nuggets. The rest is free food that has some nuggets in it, but it still tastes very good.
The great borger is so delicious that it is impossible to dislike the taste of the great borger, as itâ€™s taste automatically modifies to be better than the best thing the customer has ever tasted.
