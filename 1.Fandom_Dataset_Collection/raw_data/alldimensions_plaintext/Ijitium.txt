Ijitiums
are the first
non-particles
in the
hierarchy
and are unimaginably small (like the ones we've seen several times already, how queer...).
Our understanding of particles and just logic in general completely breaks down at this point, if it hasn’t already. What does it mean to be contained by another object, or contain another object anymore? There is so much more about non-particles we don’t know than what we do know. The only thing we know is that these “particles” are ridiculously small, and that’s a complete understatement. In fact, they don’t even really have size at all because they don’t even exist in a logical sense, not even in an abstract sense. There are no concepts or words to describe how absolutely small these “particles” actually are. It’s completely incomprehensible.
In fact, it is absent at the level of all meanings. For example, axions are present despite the fact that they are part of the axiom of absence. That is, if the physical presence and the fact that the physical itself at all levels is a shell, then the filling is conceptuality
Axioms are pure stuffing, and not conceptual objects are just a shell, but this is neither one nor the other.
Even if the
universes
were the biggest, your fantasies would be at least conceptual, which means more.
