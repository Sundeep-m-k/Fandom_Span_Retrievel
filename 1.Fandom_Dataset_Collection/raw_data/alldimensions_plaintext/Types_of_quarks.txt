Overview
[
]
Here in the fourth wall quarks are mineable because of the size changing. And with that there are a lot of types of quarks. But with the infinite theory. there is an infinite number of types of quarks. But these are the main ones
Up quark
[
]
an easy normal quark, has an up orbit, used in jetpacks here in the fourth wall
Down quark
[
]
the difference of the up quark, we use this for sticking to the wall
Top quark
[
]
doesn't gets affected by gravity and always goes to the celling
Bottom quark
[
]
doesn't gets affected by gravity and always goes to the floor.
Charm quark
[
]
we still have no idea how to use this, but we still have it
Strange quark
[
]
weird properties, still no idea how to use it
Truth quark
[
]
This can change the -, ., and -null structure of anything, therefore changing the properties
Anchant quark
[
]
A quark that has been made a countable and uncountable infinite number of years
Tetra quark
[
]
A rare type of quark. we need more research
