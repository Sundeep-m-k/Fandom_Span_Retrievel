Iternorium
is a partially cuandavic element with 173
protons
and 2
cuandavii
. It is mostly used to create vast amounts of energy.

Iternorium is mostly made from
iternoralite
, a mineral found within specific high-instability
verses
. To process iternoralite into iternorium, you need to do a stupidly complex chemical process with billions of steps, that involves substances such as
Guaca Regia
and other crazy shit. Processing iternoralite also gives a bunch of byproducts such as other cuandavic elements
(only 60% - 70% of iternoralite is iternorium)
.
Usage
[
]
When iternorium atoms hit stray cuandavii
(a process that can be artificially done through cuandavis rays)
, they can turn into
Udekinorium
, an element whose number is 173c3. Udekinorium is stupidly radioactive, and the energy it gives when it decays is vastly bigger than the energy required to make it
(1 kg of udekinorium can create up to 10
100
J)
.
Discovery
[
]
Iternorium was first discovered by some random god named F̃roj̏-[K̉L]i͠n-A̧-k
(wow this name makes me want to kill myself)
that was trying to make their first verse. Unfortunately, it didn't go very well, and they made a highly unstable verse. F̃roj̏-[K̉L]i͠n-A̧-k then abandoned the verse, and as the verse rapidly changed, Iternoralite crystals started growing inside of it.

Most civilisations have quarries in unstable verses with good conditions for large-scale iternoralite mining. Sufficiently advanced civilisations can engineer verses to have the perfect conditions for growing septemdecillions of iternoralite crystals, with fully automated systems to mine them and process them into iternorium. We interviewed an iternoralite mining robot!!
"bro... my entire life is just looking at these iternoralite crystals and selecting which ones are sufficiently grown to send mining robots.. sometimes i have to wait entire
OYC
just to select one. good thing my creators didn't program boredom!" -Iternoralite mining robot
