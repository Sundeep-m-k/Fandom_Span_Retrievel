Squidwarp instances
are most likely a group of
entities
that spontaneously form and cause major damage to the macrocosms that they form in, basically meaning any containing
verses
nested to a certain level.
They can also affect everything that observes them, and things they don't contain but are spacially in close proximity to, or things that have influence or are influenced by the containing verses they affect.
The nature of the damage they cause varies depending on the instance, and the extent to the damage caused also depends on the instance. Lower level squidwarp instances are usually no bigger than the class systems, Mid level instances are post-class size (usually), and High level instances have no known limit to their scale and power, all related to them being estimates rather than facts.
Higher low level instances are capable of affecting structures like
6
, Mid levels can almost always destroy structures greater or containing
6
, and High levels do not need further explanation here. All attempts to harm a squidwarp instance, even the lowest level ones, have failed.
The danger of the weakest squidwarp instances does not come from the fact they destroy
protoverses
, but that the damage they cause to lower
elementary particles
, proto
particles
, pseudoparticles, and preparticle objects can cause chain reactions capable of damaging any finite structure, and it has been observed being capable of destroying greater transfinite constructs by unknown means.
The greatest extent to the seemingly weak lowest level squidwarp instance chain reaction damage observed is the destruction of several high
CS55
sized objects, specifically a group of
desomorphineverse clusters

. This therefore means, quite obviously, that all squidwarp instances can pose serious existential threats to anything existing within the first 55 positive class systems. Mid level and greater squidwarp instances can affect observational equipment which is dangerous for obvious reasons.
Squidwarp instances have been sighted mutating and forming tentacles, which appear to cause more damage to spatial things. This has not been observed to happen with high level squidwarp instances. It is unknown if squidwarp instances are separate entities, being produced by a powerful entity, or manifestations of a powerful entity. They are treated, however, as separate entities.
No communication has yet been established with a squidwarp instance. The squidwarp instance in the infobox image is the 14th most destructive squidwarp instance ever observed. It caused heavy damage to observational equipment and was very hard to track. Squidwarp instances likely have the potential to be
ultimate
entities. A hypothetical ultimate squidwarp instance would probably be the end of everything we know of except other ultimates.

Section 1.1 -- squidwarp classification (COMPLETE SECTION)
[
]
(NF) New Formation: New formation means the squidwarp instance has just formed and cannot yet be classified.
(D) Dissipated/Missing: The squidwarp instance has dissipated or has disappeared. Still dangerous in the affected verses due to chain reactions.
(LD) Low danger: Used for low end instances. Usually means low end instances that don't immediately affect transfinite objects.
(mD) Mild danger: Used for low end instances that aren't Low danger but not dangerous enough for moderate danger. Ranges from low danger end to first class system end.
(MD) Moderate danger: The instance can affect all class systems.
(MH/ HMD )M-H/High Moderate danger: The instance can affect
7.
(H/Hi/HI) High danger: The instance can completely destroy all finite numberverseobjects.
(Formerly:(VH/vH) Very high) (sV, SV, S) Severe danger: Squidwarp instance is capable of highly manipulating any infinite numberverseobject.
(EX) Extreme danger: Higher than very high danger.
Section 2 -- the main organizations specializing in research, observation, and defense from such squidwarp instances (WIP SECTION)
[
]
The three largest squidwarp related organizations are COSO (Centre of Squidwarp Observation), COSR (Centre of Squidwarp Research), and SITRADA (Squidwarp Instance Tracking, Research, and Defense Agency). These three groups are typically the first to observe, locate, and analyze newly formed instances. The COSO and COSR were at one point the same thing, but split in 2003 and are now just affiliates. SITRADA is not an organization that does anything itself, but is rather comprised of many branches and has many affiliate organizations, like
Interpol
. COSO specializes in observation and analysis of squidwarp instances, COSR specializes in research, analysis, and some observation of squidwarp instances, and SITRADA specializes in everything related to squidwarp instances. W.I.P
Trivia

Entities that are affected by a Squidwarp instance can be "infected" by their energy.
Entities affected by this energy tend to attract Squidwarp instances.
Extremly infected entities can turn into Squidwarp instances themselves.
This corrupted energy dissapears gradually.
