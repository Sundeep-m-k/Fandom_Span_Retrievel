The
Infinite Colors
is an orb that has all colors, even past the rainbow! But the spectrum for this never ends, and since it has all the colors it's very bright! There are layers, somehow life, currency, and a language!

Layer 1: The Orb
[
]
The Orb is well, an orb! It has a sphere, and is the glowing part of the structure. It has extreme temperatures, but somehow there is life on it. It is made out of Color Matter with some
Primordium Delta
and
Primordium Alpha
with it. It has all colors. (phi ray, theta ray, delta ray, and more. (all alphabets used then it just slowly becomes nonsense))
Layer 2: The Energy
[
]
The energy is an invisible, theta ray emitting (below delta ray, and thats below) matter is a plasma that creates energy, not by using fusion, but by using the Color Matter, to go into the Primordium Delta at such high speeds because of gravity of the orb, and this pushes the orb. It is like the sun, but with different stuff. But you might ask, why cant you see it. It splits the light into only theta rays, so you cant see. The way it works is by pushing the delta so fast, that it splits the color matter to 1 Angel Matter, A few primordium alpha and delta, but most importantly, White Hole Matter. It repels, all the matter, causing the effect, but the shattering of the particle makes the energy.
Layer 3: Voided Energy
[
]
Stored inside of the energy is Voided energy, a alpha ray emitting (above sigma ray, and thats above beta ray, and then thats above gamma ray) energy, and is a more powerful form, but somehow all the alpha is now omega, causing insane darkness, but the energy has the repulsion so, it doesn't happen, plus the white hole matter is now black hole matter, but it doesn't suck because of the white hole matter repelling it, except for the voided energy, but it doesn't happen fast. Because of the insane repulsion and destruction and all the stuff, it creates so much energy, that it creates the alpha rays.
Currency
[

The currency is called Alha, probably referencing Primordium Alpha. It also has a second reference on the coin. It has an alpha symbol on it.
Alha.
