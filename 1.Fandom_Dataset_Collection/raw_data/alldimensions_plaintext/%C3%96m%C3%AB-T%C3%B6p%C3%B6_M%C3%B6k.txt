Eggnogan
for "
Greatest Verse
", is a verse that contains many hierarchies such as
The Disc
. It was named by 4 Egg-Creatures exploring the hierarchy, that found out they looped back into the
Protoverse
when they passed
Infinity and Beyond
, and figured they were living in a hierarchical circle. They then upgraded their technology to progress 2-dimensionally through the hierarchy to escape
The Disc
and enter this verse. They were surprised and voted on a name for the verse. The name is in Eggnogan because Egg-Creatures speak, well, Eggnogan.
