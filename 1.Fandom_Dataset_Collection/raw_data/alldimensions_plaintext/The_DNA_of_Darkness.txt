The
DNAs of Darkness
(or DNAD for short) are large DNA-shaped structures that contain
Pens
. They're the third object in the
Giganta's Class
. DNADs are made by particles colliding into each other, eventually making the DNA structures.
Our local DNAD used to be white 400 quintillion years ago, but then parasites destroyed the DNAD's heart, making everything inside of it, yes everything, dark. After that, space was forever dark. The only light was stars, light years away.
