Description of the Verse
[
]
This verse is a purple tree with many white lights sprinkled in with the leaves. This verse is also really cold, so you should put on a suit that can withstand very cold temperatures, like one that
Metasm
made. Opposite to what should happen normally, the closer one gets to the white lights, the colder it gets. There is plenty of life within this verse, and the life here is mostly friendly. However, some creatures you will encounter are hostile, so be cautious when interacting with life in this verse. In summary, this verse can be dangerous if proper precautions are not taken.
