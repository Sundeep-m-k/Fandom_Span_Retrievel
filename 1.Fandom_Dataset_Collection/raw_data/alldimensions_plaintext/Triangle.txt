Types of Triangle
[
]
By Sides
[
]
Equilateral
[
]
When all of the angles and edges of a triangle are equal a triangle is equilateral. Each angle must have a measure of exactly 60 degrees.
Isosceles
[
]
When a triangle has two equal sides, it is isosceles. It must also have two equal angles.
Scalene
[
]
A triangle with three unique side lengths is known as a scalene triangle.
By Angles
[
]
Acute
[
]
A triangle with all three angles smaller than 90 degrees is called an acute triangle. All equilateral triangles are also acute triangles.
Right-Angled
[
]
A triangle with one right angle is a right-angled triangle. Their side lengths follow the equation
a
2
+
b
2
=
c
2
{\displaystyle a^2+b^2=c^2}
, where c is the edge length of the side opposite the right angle.
Obtuse
[
]
A triangle where at least one angle is greater than 90 degrees is called an obtuse triangle.
Special Cases
[
]
A triangle with more than one right angle is usually degenerate, but can appear on the surface of a
sphere
. The same applies to a triangle with angles that sum to greater than 180 degrees, and to triangles that have any angle equal to 180 degrees.
