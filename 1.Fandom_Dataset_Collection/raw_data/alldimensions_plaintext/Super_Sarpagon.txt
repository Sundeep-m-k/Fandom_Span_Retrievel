Same as their Sarpagons.
Glitchy?
Not at all normally.
Slighty when on hyper expansions.

Density (Void Percentage)
23.53618% on average, ours has slighty more (25,16826%). Dont ask how they contain way more Sarpagons than what their size may indicate at first.

[The Super Sarpagon]
, also known as the
Super Sarpagons
are the next type of
verse
in the
Sarpagon
's
chain
. Super Sarpagons contain roughly

each, and due to having a similar appearance to them (compare the image in the infobox of both verse's articles) they receive such name.

Timeline storage
[
]
One of the special things about the Super Sarpagons is that they're able of containing every action which can be undone creating a new timeline. These timelines are branched like
fractals
and with different colors depending on their hierarchical order, with the color scheme of them varying in each Super Sarpagon. In the case of our local Super Sarpagon, the main timelines are red while the ones directly below them are orange, and the ones directly below the latters are yellow, and so on.
"Hyper expansion"

Another weird property most Super Sarpagons have is that once in a while they randomly fly at speeds of around

per Omni-instant in any direction, which also constantly changes. This odd event is known as
Hyper Expansion
or "the hyper expansion", as when they do this, they leave a trail of
particles
that soon grow into new Super Sarpagons. This event commonly happens every
