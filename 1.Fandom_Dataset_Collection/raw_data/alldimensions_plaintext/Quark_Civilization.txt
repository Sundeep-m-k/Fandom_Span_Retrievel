A
quark civilization
is a civilization that was smaller than a quark by 1 million times while living in it. They were very smart despite their size. Their brains worked differently. They were beyond our comprehension.  They were square in shape.  They were able to successfully colonize quarks. And when they did, they decided that the quark would be -1 on the Kardashev scale. This has diverged very much and now quark  officially is -1 on the
Kardashev Scale
