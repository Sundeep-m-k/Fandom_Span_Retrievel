The
Transcendent Megaverse
is the weirdest type of transcendent verses because:
They don't have a core, or at least not one located in their center for some reason. In case they do exist, their assigned name would be the "Megatranscendium".
We don't even know if their existence is confirmed. Therefore, we don't know details like its temperature, exact size, etc.
It's theorized that they can bend themselves, because there are some places inside this megaverse that switched locations. However, this effect is a lot slower than the one shown in the image.
We don't have more interesting information, and we have come to the conclusion that
this place will remain a mystery. It's possible that we will never find out its secrets.
