In Observatorio
(formerly named
Sentialusexotiansverse
) is a very strange Verse. It started off as an average-size verse, but then, well...
It also has a similar ability to
Obice Novissimo
, being able to ruin anything that gets larger than it and cannot protect itself by crumpling it and breaking it until all is left is something smaller than a
Hebb
The massive creature thing in the picture is the cosmic entity
EEEE
, the god and gaurdian of this Verse and many others. The reason it is called something that translates to “The Observatory” is because it is where he gazes into Verses he protects, due to it’s strange properties.
Before The Great Expansion, it was average size and had sentience. it is assumed The Great Expansion was it dying. Also, while correlation may not be causation, this actually happened only a few years after EEEE moved in.
The Great Expansion
[
]
At one point after it existing for quite a long while, every Sentialus-Port in In Observatorio exploded and it began to expand extremely rapidly to an immeasurable size, larger than almost anything else. After settling at a size a small bit bigger than
Biggernoseverse
, it contained it and, suddenly, went dead, it’s sentience no longer running.
Appearance Pre-Great Expansion
[
]
It used to look somewhat similar, but with a bluer color scheme and small circles, Sentialus-Poruts, dotted throughout.
