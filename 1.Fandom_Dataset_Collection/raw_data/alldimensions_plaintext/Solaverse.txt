The Solaverse is where there are warm colors only. (No blues, purples, greens, blacks, whites, etc.) Temperature is high here, as if it was eternal summer.
Due to how the Solaverse has a high temperature, the Solaverse's stars are much brighter and hotter due to the Solaverse's general temperature being very high. Most planets in the Solaverse are covered with magma/volcanoes or deserts due to this as well.
In the Solaverse, temperatures cannot be below 1 degrees Celsius. Because of this, ice is not possible in the Solaverse.
