Summary: The
Transillud Omnistructure
is inaccuratly described as a verse that is as flat as a hypersurface, but in reality it is a massive
ω

{\displaystyle \omega^3}
-dimensional structure(the sphere is). It can be described as being littered with "galactical spirals." (that lead to some sort of singularity) littered all around them. This superior verse ( to the Loweffortverse) has extreamly unpredictable behaviour and nature. Now, the hypersurface exists on the shell of the sphere but weirdly enough some parts begin to bend into a bunch of holes. The surface is littered a bunch of "Holes(or galaxy-like structres)." that extend out like fractals if you zoom in closer, but from a far it seems like massive spirals that are all around it, same as other Transillud Omnistructures but we're focusing on one structure only. It has a VERY similar appearence to the multiversian style of spheres where it looks as if it's containing our universe, (instead those tiny dots and sprinkles are a bunch of galactical spirals that are on the surface of the thing, not inside of it.)
Here is a demonstration of what we can expect and understand before reading about the spirals.

Understanding the spirals and the mysteriousness surrounding this verse...

As we have come to understand, let's zoom into the galactical-spirally structures that surround the Transillud Omnistructure. First of all they tend to disappear, split up into millions of infinite pieces or be in superposition which means the spirals can exist in two locations at once and sometimes they are able to stop existing entierly and come back to action. They could also merge together, or extent out like fractals which explains the unpredictability of the Transillud Omnistructure. They also tend to warp like black-holes do into some very funny shapes though it's very unpredictable and it seems to have infinite patterns of how they can move around within the sphere. First of all, these spirals have a center-region that basically is some sort of enterence to some sort of "hole." that is basically the first enterence of the Transillud omnistructure. Now, every single pathway have their own levels exactly and we'd be looking into something that applies to every single "Hole." in this scenario.
So, when the observer starts going inside of the hole they'd encounter different layers, now they are also a self-containing structure that works pretty much the same as
The Box
but instead you can exit these holes but once you'd gone inside you can go pretty much forever, but trying to escape it via the walls either just sends you straight to a lower verse, or just teleports you to the oppesite side of the cyllindrical cone that seems progressivly smaller.

The Rainbow Zone (X-1) ( L-0 to L-3)

As one would enter through the enterence, they'd see a ton of fractals that spiral around the enterence, and it seems to split into many path-ways as one of them are the right way to the next one. What makes this less easier as one would go down the levels, is that the path-ways begin to split into fractal-like structures that may trick the observer into thinking this is the right way. The hypersurface of the walls of the hole has a similar containing method to
Omnistructure 1
where the objects are translated into a 2D surface, except the surface actually appears 3D to the eyes and that may trick the person to going into the wrong direction. When gone into the wrong direction, the observer may find themselves back at the oppesite side of the hole, as if it has a self-containing structure similar to

However, it is very easy to not get lost as long as the observer could see the actual path-way down the very long hole. It has a veriety of fractals that the observer would see, hence the name: "Rainbow Zone." where one would see millions of colours, even these colours can be extended to many fractal-like structures. It's very normal to see these things, but as you'd go deeper into the hole the fractals split even further which may obscure your view of your journey, however the illusions are manegable for sure. The space around you seems to get smaller until X-2.
The Strange Zone (X-2) - (L-4 -> L-7)
[
]
The Strange Zone
It's dimension is unknown. There is very little information beyond this point.
If one manages to venture far enough, the space is no longer getting smaller but rather bigger. As it gets bigger, it gets much darker as the fractals begin to split by the factor of
ℵ
ω
{\displaystyle \alef_\omega}
for every milimeter. Every level, the factor begins to stack up further until everything seems almost pitch black. The Twilight zone is where all of this begins slowly, while it approaches the Hadal Zone where it's pitch black but you can still see where the hole is going. The fractals begin to lose their colour, while the walls of the hole seemed to have expanded so much that you no longer can see the beauty of the fractals anymore. These fractal contains the lower verses of course of many dimensions. They may begin to flicker and the fractals may grow and shrink as the observer moves further into the massive abyss. Now, as a reminder where the observer would go is basically "this white hole in the middle." though the white hole may change colours into some sort of fractally-like structure where you'd have to keep going in the middle, forever. At the Tartaros Zone, one may begin to see the hole (Where you are supposed to go) split up as well into many pieces but it should be managable to dicern the right one. Now, the walls seem to come back as one the observer may see the outline of fractals, but they seemed to have lost all of their colour due to the sheer darkness of this place. The Tartaros Zone, is the most darkest thing one could go through in this entire verse, it's
ℵ
0
{\displaystyle \aleph_0}
times darker then normal Vanta-black so that's how dark this is, but you may still be able to see the fractals so it might not be truly dark after-all. If one tries to escape from the sides, they'd be lost if they cannot find their way back to the hole as they'd be looped (Just like in The Box), which is a white dot in the darkness but one may be disoriented because there are also "dot like" things that may further make it harder to focus on their journey.
The Collapse Zone (X-3)
[
]
The Collapse Zone
We do not understand how the thing works. However, (it is not this rainbowy, but it's rather pitch black with a white hole in the middle.)
The collapse Zone is where the walls of the hole begin collapsing immidietly in a radical fasion, as if it goes straight down, to a tiny tiny hole at the size of the
Milky Way
so missing your mark would end up making you loop in extreamly weird ways. You could be sent back to where you were started, (at the beginning of X-3). Once you'd find this abysmally small sized hole you are finally inside of X-4.
The Semi-Inecessbility X-4 (L-8 -> L-10)
[
]
What you'd expect to see in L-8 and L-10. (You'd see even more of this at L-10 though).
The fractals begin teleporting around the hypersurface(or the walls of the hole) at L-8, it would appear as if it would bend it up and rip the entire surface in half. Some exist in superposition with other fractals and some of them may shrink, and grow to ??? sized fractals. At L-8, you'd also encounter mandlebrots and extreamly weird fractal-sets that have never been recorded in humanity in a while. However, as you begin to reach L-9 you'd see something completly indifferent. The "Hole." that is supposed to lead you to the singularity begins to split into a billion sets of holes and that begins to worsen at L-10 as the hole is almost impossible to dicern and diffierintiate. The hypersurface is no longer present, or so it seems but its still there but has been affected by the inverse square law so much that...It no longer seems to exist anymore. One should turn back, because at L-10 is where one would get lost trying to find the hole. It's imposssible, or...Is it?
The Hyper Inecessible Zone X-5 (L-11 -> L-12) and beyond...
[
]
The hypersurface breaks up into some sort of "Cloudy" cyllinder. (The image to the right.) that extends on for eternity. The fractals exist in a full superposition, and has broken it's hypersurface containment, but it has also been contained by the verse still as it is a self containing structure. Through endless hallways one would go, through endless paths through his point, and the observer might never find a way to go forward. The fractals super-exist, but also do not exist and exist at the exact same time but it appears that it is existing normally to the observer from the outside. The observer could notice that they are in a mirror-like-dimensional pathway that reflects the same path-way and yourself again and again. It's like a funhouse mirror, but much worse as the mirror-like structures begin to bend and twist. At this point, there is no way to know what might happen, but it's so inecessible that one should turn back instead.......No more information beyond this point.
At the singularity, nobody knows what it is. It's impossible to know at this for how far it goes, but one could speculate that there is an "end." to all of this. (Information remains inconclusive at this point, there is no longer any observation beyond that point.)
