The
Chicken
is a massive sentient chicken-like creature that contains our local
Voidtown
. It is known to have great power and is capable of easily destroying verses larger than it within an instant. Another special aspect about the Chicken is that it is a verse and an entity at the same time. It also owns an almost exact (as in composition, but this one is much bigger) copy of
the blade
that uses as a weapon. The Chicken lives in a
deepverse
.
It also has many other powers that other insane cosmic entities have, like full control over space, time, reality, etc. The Chicken is also extremely intelligent, being able to do basically anything with its mind. Its strenght allows it to erase around 1/100th of a deepverse instantly.
The reason why it contains our Voidtown is because once it found something that seemed like a funny speck of dust to it, eating it. Guess what, that "speck of dust" happened to be our Voidtown, and now the Chicken works as some kind of barrier for it. In fact, this chicken is the mother of
nightmare godity
which is the ruler of our local Voidtown.
Its main hobby is playing Counter Strike, and thus it is very proficient at the game, being so good it can win against any number of relatively skilled players by itself (obviously).
This chicken is a very boring entity, and there isn't much else we know about it, so that's all for this page.
