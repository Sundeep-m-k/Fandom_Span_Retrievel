The Process
is a large verse which contains

.
The Generator
[
]
The Process has a massive generator in the middle of it which helps create new verses at a constant rate. It ensures that The Process does not become a void, as the verse ejects its contents at a ridiculous pace (
Œ∂
13
{\displaystyle \zeta_{13}}
verses every
Voidsecond
).
Getting close to the generator will almost certainly mean instant death
(even if you are a god-like being), as the generator will launch its newly created verses at a speed enough to kill
Bongus
with a single
metaverse
. All new verses created from the generator will slow down at an exponential rate, and will eventually stop moving unless they are ejected.
The generator, as it needs to constantly produce large verses such as
..::..::..:::...::::::..:::.::.:::
,
requires a lot of energy to stay active
. This usually means that it has to consume nearby verses to create new ones. The generator also takes in energy from
The Fuel
, The Process' containing verse.
