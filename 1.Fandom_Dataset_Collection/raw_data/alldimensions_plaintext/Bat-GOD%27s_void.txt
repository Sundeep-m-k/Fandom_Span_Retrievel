Prison 0101 of the Bat-GOD
The Void of the Bat-GOD Is a Cosmic Void created by
The Bat-GOD
to potentially serve as a prison for random people he decides to imprison for one reason or another. However, he is nice and decides to not have them be stuck there forever and have them never leave so there's that. The picture is AI generated to understand what it looks like. This Void doesn't really contain that much besides his prisons.
