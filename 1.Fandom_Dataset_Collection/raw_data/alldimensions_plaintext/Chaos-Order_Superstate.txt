Holding a Chaos-order Duality
When one refers to a cosmic balance or duality between
chaos
and
order
, it isn't some deity that usually does so, but rather a concept of it maintaining that balance. A nation or a large structure are not typical things of which do not consider to be in a set balance, but you find it everywhere in reality. A proton stays stable even though inside of it a soup of bubbling and chaotic energy is present, yet it can still maintain its
order
, a perfect balance between
order
and
chaos
to maintain all of reality. We can see it in nations alike, every strives for an
order
, but without
chaos
, who is to say they are prepared for even a slight shift in
order
? What if a terrorist attacks unexpectedly in an utopia? When one is
chaos
, one learns to adapt until reaching perfect
order
(death), perfect
chaos
(infinite complexity) or a perfection of stance between both, where one is alive, but not self-destructing or self-creating. This conceptual duality is once again found from tiny microscopic universes to the grandeur
final fractalism
, all of these are parts of the
chaos
-
order
duality. One cannot reach an eternity state of a structure even if in all
order
as with no change, there is always room for better. But, what if perfect
order
or
chaos
is just a mere facet of the true reality of it all? How do you know you have reached either? In the grand scheme of things one must always be a lower set in an universal set of a
order
-
chaos
duality, a set, perhaps a creature or an idea present in all worlds that have the possibility to exist, a LaPlace Demon of pure abstract reality capable into doing all that it logically is able to do so of which its somewhere in one of these worlds possible. Such a being would be in an almost
chaos
or
order
Superstate, where it can do all of the previously mentioned. One to hold a balance of infinities of magnitudes, one being that at face value is a perfectly simplistic nothingness, but in the end, is the basis for everything. A being that has always existed, must always exist, and one to know all there can be for it is the begin, origins and stabilisation of all.
Story
[
]
Defining a story for an all-being is not a thing you could do. A true abstraction beyond space and time wouldn't have a sense of there being a time before or after it, although, since its an origin and reason of and for time, one could say it does having a sense of time as a part of itself experiences

, or other such amount of temporal dimensions until reaching incomprehension. But once again one could say that that doesn't matter, as those higher temporal branes are still originated from it. You could reach a conclusion that the superstate itself is in itself is simple, but, does it contain the worlds it supports? If no, than you could argue that the superstate projects itself on another simplistic or purely nothingness plane where it gets realised into reality. But where does itself and the plane exist though? Considering both are abstract, maybe "where" is useless to it. But what does it mean to exist with no place? Would such a thing exist everywhere? Would it exist without any physiology? Maybe you could think of an infinite hierarchy of transcendental voids of higher concepts or conceptions of spacetime until it reaches beyond the absolute infinite. What if it is present in space, but instead of our conception, its a space of spiritual or platonic material? The superstate is in itself a platonic concept after all, simplistic, unreachable, perfect... If yes, than perhaps the world looks like a circle, a circle of complexity, you have the top, something purely simplistic, like a collective idea from a collective unconscious, or an automatic idea given from birth. Go further right and down, you get addition, multiplication, inflation, using software and etc... You could go on, to quantum mechanics, complex calculus, understanding higher dimensions, but further you go, you go from understanding the material to comprehending it. You begin to comprehend infinity, able to conceptualize infinite dimensionality, think through time and eventually understanding
things grand enough for the minds of your peers to collapse into a black hole
. You go on and on and on, finally conceptualizing infinite hierarchies of structures going beyond the absolute infinite and transcendence beyond belief, and yet, you find... nothing, and you'll realise that all your knowledge spans from the superstate. All of it is simple down at its core, the simplicity is that everything can be conceptualized down to
chaos
