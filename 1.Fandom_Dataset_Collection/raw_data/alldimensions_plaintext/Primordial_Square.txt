The
Primordial Square
is the 4th type verse of the
Primordialverses chain
. They contain approximately 3.24 x 10^20
Primordial Boxes
, 8.1 x 10^15
Primordiolises
, and 90 million
Primordial Strings
each. They're contained by
Primordial Cubes
, which contain 90 million Primordial Squares each and neighbours other Primordial Cubes.
Structure
[
]
They're planes with countless Primordiolises and many millions of Primordial Strings. They keep stable due to hypergravity, infrared connectors, and metaballs to keep Primordial Cubes stable.
Primordium Shape Connectors
[
]
These are connectors that sticks a Primordial Square to another one. Because of that, Primordial Cubes are formed.
