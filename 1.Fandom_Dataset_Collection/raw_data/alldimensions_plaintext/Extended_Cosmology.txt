Main article:
Verse
A verse (i.e.
Metaverse
) is a spatial container with
axioms
and a defined region. Generally, verses contain the
Universe
directly or with another object as an intermediate verse.
Containment hierarchies

Main article:
Containment
An diagram of an arbitrary containment hierarchy
A containment hierarchy is a chain of
supersets
, starting from the
Universe
or another object. These have no length limits, but most documented hierarchies have hundreds of objects.
Examples of containment hierarchies on All Dimensions are listed under
List of hierarchical articles
.
Hypocosmology
[
]
â¬¤, a hypocosmological object
Hypocosmology is a related topic to hypercosmology referring to fictional objects below
elementary particles
. Objects observed in hypocosmology include objects of negative size, hyper-elementary particles, negative cardinalities of properties, and experimentation of other logical properties.
History
[
]
Verses have made appearances in creative works and speculations since 1895, when
William James
coined the term "multiverse" to refer to a collection of universes. Carykh later released a video titled
The Scale Past the Universe
, causing
Aarex
to found the All Dimensions wiki in early 2012 out of inspiration.
Various forks of All Dimensions would be pioneered since 2016 for varying reasons, such as
Verse and Dimensions
,
Beyond Totality
, and
Ultimas Cosmology
. Relevant communities would gain more attention in 2018 and the years following, with a recession in activity forming over 2021 and parts of 2022.
