each and a portal
A
Terminal Box
is a massive box encompassing a huge portion of the
First Realms
, and they also seems to have a portal within them which lead to the
Alternate Omnipyramids
, massive structures of the
Second Realms
. They're solid and liquid, digital and physical. There is no civilization in them. Every now and then a
Yetmmud
will travel through a portal to a Terminal Box.
Our local Terminal Box is constantly decreasing in size, but at an extremely slow rate. It is theorized that when it becomes smaller than our local
True Box
, catastrophic events will occur.
