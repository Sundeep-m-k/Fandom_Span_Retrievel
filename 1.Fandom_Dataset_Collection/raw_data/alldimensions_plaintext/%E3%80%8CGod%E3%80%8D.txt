About
[

„ÄåGod„Äç
is the strongest
being
(at least stronger than fictional entities) recorded, even surpassing ones like
Mutant
and
Oblivion
. The reason why it has such a status is because:
„ÄåGod„Äç is not a fictional being.
„ÄåGod„Äç can delete the pages in the
wiki
.
„ÄåGod„Äç is not contained nor restrained by anything in
fiction
.
„ÄåGod„Äç is not affected by anything like Mutant's presence.
„ÄåGod„Äç lives in the "
Real life
".
The „ÄåGod„Äç is even above
you
, who reads this page now.

Small disclaimer: Unlike
Carl The Redeemer
, „ÄåGod„Äç is not classified as an 'Outside of Wiki' level entity, but as one that surpasses it along with fiction and real life.</smaller>
About real life
[
]
The
real
Earth is the third out of eight
planets
of our
Solar System
. It features a
natural satellite
known as "moon". It has over 200 cities on it filled with
lifeforms
such as
humans
and other animals, plants, etc.
It is theorized that it was indirectly created by the
Big Bang
of our
Universe
, which after billions of years bringed the solar system and Earth into existence, though the latter was completly uninhabitable at first. It had to wait even more time in order to upgrade its environement so life could start forming on it.
The Big Bang isn't the only theory regarding the creation of our world, though. Some say divine beings were the ones responsible for its existence, such as „ÄåGod„Äç. There's no real way to deny nor confirm this, though, so it is a quite controversial and open debate.
Photoshopped image of ancient human civilizations worshipping Jerald, as a meme.
The first instances of prebiotic life were composed of lifeforms such as bacterias and viruses (technically not living beings tho). The formers were far simpler back then than they are now, and eventually they were advanced enough to start evolving into more complex organisms such as fungi over a large period of time. Even nowadays these "beings" remain as threats agaisnt most lifeforms (for example: the Coronavirus). Back to the bacterias, they obviously didn't remain as simple beings such as fungi, but instead they kept on evolving into more complex beings: worms, fishes, reptiles, bird and even humans are just a few examples of what they managed to turn into, and its still going! Just at a very slow pace, like always.
In order to be more specific regarding the evolution species, hundreds of millions of years ago the dinosaurs were born and they roamed the Earth, becoming the dominant species of it. They were capable of eating most plants and animals (including themselves). They finally went extinct 65 million years ago, when a giant rock from space hit Earth (the event was known as the "Chicksxulub impact"), and with the help of other events such as contamination of the atmosphere caused by volcanos, killed most large animals such as dinosaurs and marine reptiles. During this time, the ancestors of humans were small mammals that overcame this event due to their smaller size.
Finally, those mammals evolved into primates then finally into humans which developed more and more technology over time. Eventually, some of them created none other than the wiki you're reading this, where they are manifested as avatars known as Transcendent Omni-Gods. This name was given due to their transcendence over their fictional creations.
So yea, that's basically a resume of the story of our planet, ourselves and this wiki. At least the one according to science. If you saw the second paragraph of this section, you'll know that this isn't the only point of view regarding this topic. Tons of religions atribute the creation and evolution of this world to beings like „ÄåGod„Äçs, though nothing can be confirmed nor denied about this.
