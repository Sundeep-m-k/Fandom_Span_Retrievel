All verses in the
Multiverse
The
Alatarverse
is an element verse, which means it has a high number of one element, which is Alatarium, the 27+ith element. However, it doesn't have nearly as much of one element as a
Periodicverse
. It is also called the
Bi
deltaverse
, because it had two Black Holes. However, they don't exist anymore because the collision with the
Ferroverse
somehow destroyed both of them.
The Alatarverse contains
Alatarium planets
, normal planets, and normal planets with some alatarium in them. These tend to be bigger, because they are normal planets that collided with Alatarium planets.
History
[
]
The
Alatarverse
was created 21.7 billion years ago, and instead of a superplanet crashing into it, its Alatarium was created naturally. 8.2 billion years ago, it crashed with
Ferroverse
, and formed the
Palladiumverse
.
