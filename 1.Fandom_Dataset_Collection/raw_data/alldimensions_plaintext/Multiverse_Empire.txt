Exploration

]
A person named Mwilcos Waxelthon Germesik Kikilms explored many universes in a multiverse near ours and wanted to create an empire. On January 19, 3000, he named his empire "The Empire of the Multiverse". More people discovered more universes and so expanded the size of this empire. 100 years later, the empire was renamed to the Multiverse Empire.
Life
[

Yes, there is life on the Multiverse Empire, however, only 100 planets are fully colonized and 500 partially colonized. Despite this, 2 billion people built oceans on 100 thousand of the planets, so by the Earth year 3500, we can expect 1,000 more planets to be colonized on. They also have higher standards than that of our Earth. The average life expectancy, without taking using immortal pills, is 192,461 years old. T
hey have sent over a thousand teleport machines, so go to the Multiverse Empire whenever you can.
