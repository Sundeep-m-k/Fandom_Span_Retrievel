About
[
]
The Actual Alien is a being who lives in the Boort Cloud that is somewhere in the Multiverse, this cloud is so big that even TAA couldn't build a house for it. This being has power, he runs very fast but not fast enough to reach the diameter of the Multiverse, this being appears to be calm and quiet but when he is angry he screams with his mouth and runs, with his super speed he kills more than 100,000 entities in just one km without even touching them, he is even faster than the fastest character in the comics. A few billion OYC's ago he had a strange yellow strand of hair that was longer than a building and was small on top as if someone had molded it and wetted it to look like that, so some people started making fun of him so he decided to change it from being long to one that looked like a Capcayk, an alien food, in reality his hair was 1mm long but until now he wanted to live in his house isolated.
