The Terminationverse is the embodiment of class terminators.  This is the first and likely only verse that has multiple places/containers.  For example, the smallest Terminationverse is the
Molecule
, AKA the terminator of class 0.  Each layer of the terminationverse contains all of the verses in its class, and is only surpassable by the previous class.  The terminationverse is every class terminator.  It's
The Box
,
The Last Void
,
Blancc
, and every other class terminator, including for classes that don't even exist, like Class -1. (
Periodk
) It's basically a lot like the archverse, but for classes instead of verses.
This verse is unescapable, even if you go past the infinity-th class terminator (
The Spawn
), there are still ordinal terminatorverses.  Anything past infinity layers works very similarly to Soupcount, in which it counts the number of layers there are.

There's not anything for several layers of ordinals past this point.

The last class termination, aka
Cantor's Absolute Infinity
, is unbeknownst to any classtrophysicist out there.  There have been several attempts to decipher it, make one, etc.  Most attempts at creating one were crappy attempts, as theres usually something bigger than it.  However, it is currently believed that this object is
Real Egg
, which was discovered due to
VoidSansXD
constantly trying to obtain it.  However, this is merely hypothetical.  It is also believed that there are infinite class Ω Terminationverses, just each with different authority.  For example, a low Class Ω Terminating Entity would likely be someone like
VoidSansXD
or
Ubersketch
, as they are above all the previous classes and things in said classes, but don't have any authority over it.  Meanwhile, other
Transcendent Omni-God
s, aka Administrative and Moderative and Bureaucratic Omni Gods are all 3 ranks of authority.  Currently, the person of highest authority is debated, but it's likely someone like The Embodiment.  There are also theories about passing Class Ω, but that's for another page.  The Class Ω Terminationverse, whatever it may be, is the biggest possible thing.  The only bigger thing is POSSIBLY
Nothing
.
