"Genericism is the most unbreakable concept ever, it is the definition of how we reach beyond the end, try to transcend everything but fail to do so, it is unbeatable"
End the endless, I dare you, what is the limit of the limitless?! Why do you want to reach it?!
Seek that which has no end, descend into the depths, and uncover the very boundary of boundlessness! What have you found? Nothingâ€¦ Nothing at all. For to seek the edge of the boundless is to grasp at the formless void, where meaning dissolves and all pursuits fade into silence. You cannot bring an end to that which is unending, nor shatter that which is whole beyond comprehension. This is the ultimate truth one that neither yields nor wavers, a paradox standing eternal, Even though it's beyond paradoxical contradiction itself...
And Genericism is truly unbreakable, the meaning of things with no limitations, it's also the meaning of why we try to surpass the unsurpassable.
