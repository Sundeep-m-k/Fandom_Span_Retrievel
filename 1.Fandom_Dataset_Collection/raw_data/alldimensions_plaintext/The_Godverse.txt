The
Godverse
is an unique type of
verse
, being above our
Omniverse
but below our
Outside
. Its role in it is still extremly important, though, as the Godverse also has the property of being the home to our all powerful Creator, who also has the control of the next verse, consisting of the domains known as
Heaven and Hell
, in which he decides the fate of deceased entities.
Appearance
[
]
The Godverse's apparearance is... chaotic, to say the least, as it features sweeping, multicolored swirls (mainly vivid orange, blue, purple, and yellow ones) that blend and twist together in cosmic-like patterns, while also looking like a magnetic field, despite this verse's properties not being related to that concept.
Its center is the part that glows the most, as it contains the most verses across the whole Godverse.
Trivia
[
]
The Godverse's image and concept is taken from
this
video made by the youtuber "
DoDeca D.
", so credits to him!
Of course some extra information was added by myself, due to the lack of information about the Godverse in the video it was presented.
Please, do NOT start arguing about religions, just because of this article's relation to them.

The Godverse is one of the most powerful voids, because it is only 0.00001% matter, and the 'matter' is just letters. Fill in the void by
