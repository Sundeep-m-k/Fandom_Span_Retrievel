About
[
]
The
Fiction Breaker Omniverseplexes
(or F.B. Omniverseplexes) are a
conceptual
type of
verses
, simply consisting of clusters of
Fiction Breaker Omniverses
, hence their name.
Explanation
[
]
Just like the latters, they represent parts of
fiction
, each containing a certain percentage of it. Unlike them, though, they're focused on more "general" sections of it, so each takes up a higher percentage of fiction than what a normal F.B. Omniverse would. Since the latters represent
meta-fictional
Omniverses
, F.B. Omniverseplexes represent, like their name indicates,
Omniverseplexes
on a much larger and meta scale.
As an example, there could be a F.B Omniverseplex focused on videogames, one focused on series, other focused on fanfictions, etc.
Different
individuals
may classify these types of verses differently, though. For example: some may think a specific Fiction Breaker Omniverseplex takes up a higher, lower or simply different parts of the percentage of fiction than other individuals. This is another reason they're classified as conceptual verses. Some may say these verses don't even exist, in fact!
