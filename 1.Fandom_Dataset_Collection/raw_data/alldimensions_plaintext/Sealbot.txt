A Sealbot (Prob Kef'yef'efpay Prow in
The Pencil Language
) is a small machine which
patches holes in a verse's barriers
.
Sealbots have been very important in the aftermath of many wars, as many verses were ruined/destroyed and needed maintenance.
Sealbots, just like the
Stealbots
, have a cubic shape. Sealbots have 10 arms which can stretch for very long distances. These arms are
used to fill in holes or pull together parts of a verse's barrier
. 
Sealbots will usually contract their 10 arms when they aren't sealing/patching holes.
Sealbots, unlike Stealbots, have a much shorter lifespan, and will pretty much be useless
after fixing approximately 10,549 verses
(if all are 1 trillion LY in diameter and have 1000 holes which are all 5 kilometers wide).
Sealbots have
been used extensively to try to patch up the holes in the
Leakverse
, with millions of Sealbots being deployed at a time. This has been proven to be effective, although the Leakverse is still ejecting verses at a high rate.
Most advanced civilizations have a large amount of Sealbots in case their home verse is attacked, as Sealbots can repair the damage to the barrier of the verse pretty easily.
Special variants of Sealbots can, repair many more things other than verses, such as other Utilibots, buildings, structures, spacecraft, and even creatures.
The Sealbot was rated a solid 14/16 by
