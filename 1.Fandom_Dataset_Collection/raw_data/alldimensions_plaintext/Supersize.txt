Supersize is a point where it is required to truly continue the hierarchy as if anything becomes bigger than the largest object of regular size, supersized objects will automatically grow to be atleast twice the size of it and it's additional supersize measurement. A supersize meter is 100 times the size of the biggest regularly sized object, which adds onto the supersize base, 2 supersize centimeters. Supersize measurement also excludes the base. Supersize has a higher level called Hypersize, doing the same thing except to be bigger than the biggest Supersized object.
