Structure
[
]
The Facility is gargantuan, with a huge part of it being underground. There are a very large number of floors, but most have not been entered.
A handful of floors include:
The Base Floor, the first floor of The Facility (excluding underground areas). Every area in The Facility branches off from The Base Floor.
The Hall, the 1st underground floor. It is a very long, slightly cramped hallway which extends for about 6 miles until a heavily locked door prevents you from getting any further.
The Testing Rooms, the 3rd(?) underground floor. They are a complex of small rooms with operating tables, beds, incinerators, and many strange objects.
The Rows of Cells, the 4th underground floor. This area is the largest area ever discovered, and has rows upon rows of cells. A large amount of bodies are piled in one of the cells.
Sector Y-31, the deepest floor discovered as of yet, being over 504 meters below ground. It has a very odd layout. Many of the walls are destroyed or heavily damaged, and a black, viscous liquid covers the walls. A huge generator sits at the center of Sector Y-31. This generator appears to be dormant.

The Rejects
[
]
The Rejects are a hostile type of entity within The Facility. They have black, wet skin and arms which extend for over 2 meters. Most of The Rejects have bags over their head, usually with a face or the word "reject" drawn on it. The Rejects will attack if they are touched, but are easy to outrun due to their long arms.
The Prison Guards
[
]
The Prison Guards are the main threat in The Facility. They look humanoid, with strange, melted faces and very large hands with sharp fingers. Even though their hands are ridiculously huge, they can still move very fast. Prison Guards are also decently tough, being able to withstand over 60 shots from a regular plasma rifle before dying.
134-69
[
]
134-69 is a creature with no arms. It is not hostile, but will stalk whoever comes close enough to it. 134-69 also seems to be able to teleport.
'/"
[
]
'/", otherwise known as The Seeker, is the strongest creature in The Facility. It has a very strange appearance, with its 4 legs directly extending from its long, slim neck. The Seeker has been known to drip a black acidic liquid which can burn straight through virtually all material. The Seeker also has immense regeneration capabilities, being able to grow back in a split second after its neck or face has been severed.
If The Seeker is attacked, touched, or looked at, it will relentlessly pursue the creature until the creature has died, due to it or otherwise.

It is widely known that the
"Password, Please"
documents are describing what happened when The Seeker was created in The Facility. However, no one knows how the documents were scattered all across the cosmos, or how they remained there for so long.
