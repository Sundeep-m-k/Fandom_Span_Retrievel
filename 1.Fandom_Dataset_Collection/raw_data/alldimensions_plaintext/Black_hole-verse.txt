About
[
]
The
black hole-verses
are basically just ultramassive variants of the average
black holes
, but they're way more deep until you get to their singularities, which are actually
Protoverses
.
Scale
[
]
They're 10 ly in diameter on average, along with having a
mass
of about 16 trillion solar masses. Even though they're very massive (several
galaxies
of mass), their density is very low.

Black hole-verse is a super-void! That means it is a very big and empty void, having only 0.00000000000001% of its volume taken up by matter, and the 'matter' in it is just a very small amount of words, or just a single template. Fill in the super-void by
