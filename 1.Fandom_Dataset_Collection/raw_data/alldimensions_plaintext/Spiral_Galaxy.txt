Spiral galaxy ( S.A )
[
]
Spiral galaxies
are a type of
galaxy
that are disc-like in shape but have their disc of stars spun into a set of spiral arms where there is a higher concentration of nebulae and large, bright stars. It is believed that stars will regularly "pile up" inside these arms like a traffic jam, and then leave the arm to travel to the next one. Like elliptical galaxies, they vary in size from millions of stars to trillions.
Spiral galaxies can be subdivided from Sa to Sc, with later letters indicating a looser and more diffuse spiral. The Sa subcategory is usually reserved for the tightest galaxies. Unfortunately, this Wikia does not seem to use this classification, with Sb being used for barred spirals (it is actually SBa through SBc).
Well-known spiral galaxies in our universe include M33, the Andromeda Galaxy, and the Milky Way
Barred spiral galaxy ( S.B )
[
]
Barred spiral galaxies
are a type of
galaxy
similar to a spiral galaxy but possessing a central "bar" of bright stars near the core, to which the spiral arms are attached. Most spiral galaxies have bars, actually, but a "barred spiral" is usually used to refer to a galaxy with a more prominent and even bar. The creation of these bars is thought to be related to the same density wave that creates normal spiral arms.
Like normal spirals, barred spiral galaxies are subdivided from SBa to SBc based on how tightly wound they are.
Well-known barred spiral galaxies in our universe include NGC 1300 and the Milky Way (which appears to have a partial bar).
Loose spiral galaxy ( S.C )
[
]
Loose spiral galaxies
are a type of spiral
galaxy
, whose spiral arms appear to be "loose".
Whereas Sa and Sb galaxies have their spiral arms close and thin,
Sc
galaxies appear to have free-flowing, thicker arms and
SBc
galaxies have many thin arms.
SBa
and
SBb
galaxies have arms that take a sharp turn, from going straight out and into a circular manner.
Irregular spiral galaxy ( S.M )
[
]
Irregular spiral galaxies are galaxies that are irregular, which mean they aren't very symmetrical or "organized".
