The
Loopverse
is a naturally made verse, where all of 4 dimensional space is bent around in the
5th dimension
, so that if a traveller is located in any position and directed in any direction, once they go forward, t
hey will always get stuck in a loop.
Thanks to this property,
basically
no large-scaled structures can exist, as any growth means eventually looping back around to itself and getting stuck. Life could potentially exist here, but the places on which it could hypothetically exist would include couple-kilometer sized spheres of planes, but anything bigger would be a problem.
Any large objects may seem regular to 4 dimensional eyes, but the 4D space simply continues in the ways that it does,
whilst not giving a singlue clue as to how it is being bent around in 5D space
, and actually causing nearly everything to constantly hit itself, if big enough.
The
infinite number of loops for each coordinate here
, are not in the slightest unique from one another, but when light is introduced into the verse,
it creates beautiful fractal visualizations that can be seen to the infobox on the right
, where orange and green / turqoise light was shined in specific ways using advanced technology, in a recreated
Loopverse
(to allow of photons).
