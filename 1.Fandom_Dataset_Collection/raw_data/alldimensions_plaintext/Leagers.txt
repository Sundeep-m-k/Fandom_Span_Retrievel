An
Omni Home
's dimensionality + 1
Leagers
are giant octahedron-like
structures
which are part of the
10th class
. Ours was discovered in 1960
OYC
by a group of 29
Daves
, which got sucked into a
wormhole
inside the Leahers.
Not much is known about them, but the Daves found out you get sucked into their core if you enter one of their rogue wormholes with a nonexistent destination.
Leagers are constantly expanding in order to not collapse into
Omni Homes
. The part that isn't in their core is even more unstable than the non-Main Branch
Endless Perches
, as it ejects about 2/0 Omni Homes per xoctosecond. The temperature is about 32 fahrenheit or 0 celsius here.
Leagers have since then been confirmed to be one of the gems of the
Gems of Understanding
.
The Core
[
]
The core of the Leagers contain about 50 Omni Homes on average. Ours was 85% just a void with a bunch of
Geodeverses
here and there before other
entities
got sucked by it. Like we alreadt mentioned in the previous section, you can get sucked into the core of a Leagers if you enter a wormhole with a deleted destination, primarly because it's litteraly nothing.
Hence, the Core of our local Leagers is home to about 95 million entities have got teleported to the Core, including those 29
Daves
. The 95 million individuals live inside 3,628,800 apartment buildings which were
built
by 40 construction workers who also got teleported to the Core. The Core is also notably stable, ejecting roughly one
Tetraverse
per hour.
