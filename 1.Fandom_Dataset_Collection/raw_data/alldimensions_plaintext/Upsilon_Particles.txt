Upsilon Particles
are extremely small building blocks that make up
TOBA Particles
. They can vary in size, some being 100x bigger then others. Since Upsilon Particles are so small, it's very difficult to obtain images of them. These particles cannot be destroyed by anything.
Structure
[
]
Upsilon Particles contain an interconnected web of
Nothings
and
Heckverses
, and the ratio of Nothings to Heckverses determines how big the upsilon particle is; The biggest particles have 100 heckverses per nothing, and the smallest particles have close to a 1:1 ratio. Due to some sub-quantum shenanigans, there can't be more nothings than heckverses, or all of the nothings and heckverses would repel each other and the upsilon particle would theoretically cease to exist. However, we've never been able to do this to any upsilon particle, hence why we still think they can't be destroyed.
