The End of Darkness is usually thought to be the polar opposite of the
End of Chain
. While the End of Chain is very dark and has a lot of empty space, the End of Darkness is full of light and other objects and verses. It was named as an analogue to the End of Chain, but because it was so bright, it was named the End of Darkness instead.
It also is like the opposite of the End of Chain in that it took a long time to enter it instead of escaping it.

Properties
[
]
The End of Darkness is similar to
The Box
and also the End of Chain where it contains itself, however unlike the End of Chain it only contains one of itself. The End of Darkness is divided into 5 layers until it contains itself. It should be noted that because in the middle it contains itself, and so these layers could be in any order.
Layers
[
]
Light Layer
[
]
The Light Layer is the 'first' layer of the End of Darkness, and it creates most of the light that you see. It has small 'duplipockets' where if a particle goes in, two of that particle will come out. These duplipockets are
everywhere
around the End of Darkness, and it is theorized that a photon somehow got into this layer, and soon it surrounded the entire layer. Eventually, the duplipockets became depleted of energy and they disappeared. By this time, though, there were so many photons that they were actually leaking out of the End of Darkness and into the
Orbinverse
.
Transition Layer
[
]
The Transition Layer, and also the smallest layer, is a small transition from just photons into some empty space. The small amount of photons that exist here will likely be absorbed by
Kappa Particles
, or they will be rebounded with even more energy.
Verse Layer
[
]
The Verse Layer is named how it is because this is where all the verses in the End of Darkness are. All of these verses are pretty small, however, and so they do not interact much with other layers.
Noise Layer
[
]
A very chaotic layer filled with fundamental particles at extremely high speeds. Any verse (from the Verse Layer, at least) would be immediately vaporized into small particles. The noise layer also has extremely high temperatures.
Barrier Layer
[
]
A thick barrier that keeps photons from leaking into every layer of the End of Darkness. Not much is known about it, as it is hard to get past the Noise Layer.
Verses in the End of Darkness
[
]
The following is a list of verses in the End of Darkness, more specifically the Verse Layer. There hasn't been much research into these, so there isn't enough information to make a whole page.
Alkiverse
[
]
This verse is only a small dodecahedral shell, there's nothing inside it, except a book saying 'Alkiverse' in it.
Olkiverse
[
]
Contains the Alkiverse. Shaped like a sphere.
Elkiverse
[
]
Contains the Olkiverse. Shaped like a tetrahedron.
I-Lkiverse
[
]
Contains the Elkiverse. The only verse in here that has a dash.
Ulkiverse
[
]
Contains the I-Lkiverse. Shaped like a truncated icosahedron.
Taloverse
[
]
A verse with many hot and cold areas, filled with random parts of all the previously mentioned verses.
Ventaverse
[
]
Oscillates between having small blue stars and large red stars. These stars don't last long enough to know what they exactly are.
