Entropic God, Noxus is a cosmic entity. Absurd. That aberration's intentions and origins are cloaked in the deepest abyss of obscurity, yet one thing is certain: Though neither God nor Dragon, it bears a distinguished, exalted might that only they could lay claim to. What divine orchestration could have brought such extraordinary circumstances, unveiling the zenith of its grotesque powers? Is it the hand of destiny, carefully weaving the tapestry of existence? Is it mere chance? Or is it perhaps simply an unruly display of nature's caprice?  Gods and Dragons... are they the full extent of all? Might greater beings such as this linger in the realms far beyond AD Wiki? There are endless questions to be asked regarding the events that have transpired, yet scant few answers.

Behavior
[
]
Noxus is an powerful boss, teleporting extremely often and moving at extraordinary speeds while cycling between a deadly variety of attacks. It has a period of vulnerability interspered within these cycles that allow you to deal damage before it continues.
Noxus has two forms: Godless Spawn, and the Entropic God. The larval Godless Spawn is the form Noxus takes in its first phase. Once the Godless Spawn reaches 82.74% health, it abruptly freezes as a fake-out before a short cutscene plays and it transitions into its second, true form: The Entropic God.
Phase 1
[
]
All existing entities will be affected by
Deity Presence
.
Godless Spawn, Noxus teleports to the side of the target and charges, releasing sidewinding Dark Comets at the player. It charges twice before moving to the next attack.
Godless Spawn, Noxus erratically teleports around the target, creating forcefields at the points it has teleported to. After doing this 8 times, it performs a final teleport behind the target, releasing 8 Dark Comets towards them.
Godless Spawn, Noxus continuously summons portals near the target which spew out clumps of gas at them. This attack lasts for 5 seconds.
Godless Spawn, Noxus teleports directly above the target as Spikes appear nearby, indicated by vertical purple lines. It slams down, creating a visual shockwave, and fires the Spikes. This attack is repeated twice.
Phase 2
[
]
The Entropic God, Noxus charges at the target, releasing Dark Explosions along its path. This attack is repeated twice.
The Entropic God, Noxus teleports above the target, raising its hands above itself. Purple Spike-telegraph lines emanate radially outward from its hands. A few moments later, it brings its hands down, shooting out a large spread of Spikes in both directions.
The Entropic God, Noxus charges horizontally twice, once above the target, and once below the target. During each charge, it releases a vertical burst of Dark Fireballs towards the target. Each of the Dark Fireballs explodes after a few seconds.
The Entropic God, Noxus erratically teleports around the target 10 times, causing explosions every time it does so. After the 10th teleport, it raises its hands above its head and brings them down, firing a burst of Dark Fireballs at the target which explode after a few moments.
The Entropic God, Noxus teleports around the target 3 times, firing a spread of 3 gas clumps towards them.
The Entropic God, Noxus hovers in place, bringing its hands to its head in pain as a rising tone builds up for approximately 5 seconds.
Phase 3
[
]
The Entropic God, Noxus fires a burst of exploding Dark Fireballs from its hands towards the target.
Two portals appear on either side of the target at randomly rotated angles and the Entropic God, Noxus charges through them, releasing a spread of 4 exploding Dark Fireballs during each charge. 4 charges are performed before the Entropic God moves on to the next attack.
The Entropic God, Noxus shatters the screen and teleports near to the target. It rotates around them before directly charging, releasing a radial arc of 12 Dark Comets.
The Entropic God, Noxus summons a series of portals around the target, including two which are vertically aligned with them. After a few moments, each of the portals fires a Dark Comet at the target simultaneously.
Phase 4
[
]
The Entropic God, Noxus does buffed versions of previous attacks. And also gains 2 new attacks:
The Entropic God, Noxus covers the screen in dense Brain Fog, and fades into the background. After a few moments, twinkles of light start following the target around, rapidly increasing in intensity as the screen shakes violently. The Entropic God, Noxus then directly charges from the background towards the target, creating a screen-shatter effect.
The Entropic God, Noxus creates two horizontally aligned portals near the target and repeatedly dashes through while building up speed, before disappearing and performing a series of massive charges. Each massive charge is preceded by a large portal appearing near the target moments before the Entropic God, Noxus attempts to ram them, releasing a radial burst of
9
Dark Comets from the portal. 6 massive charges are performed before moving to the next attack.
