The Auroraverse is a verse filled with inert gas, with bunch of stuff electrifying it. Inert gases filling Auroraverse is not ordinary inert gas, but STRON⑨ particles made to withstand insane level of energy. All that noble gas glow makes this verse sometimes brighter than
shinoverse
(considering shinoverse is incomprehensible times smaller than Auroraverse, it proves shinoverse is utterly mad verse... once again)
Also please just pass to next heading when you realize that Auroraverse is just "ra" added to
Auroraverse
...
⌬Inert Gases⌬
[
]
The verse is filled with bunch of inert gases, mainly Krypton. Gigantic electric current runs through the verse, electrifying the gas. Obviously, the gas spits energy back in form of light. Since 100% of Auroraverse is filled with inert gas, the light Auroraverse spits is little bit too large. Actually... it becomes brighter than shinoverse luminosity trillions of times squared.
And you know what. Shinoverse even has brightness big enough to
sustain infinite-sized penteract
. Now that's where you realize Auroraverse is lunatic.
⌬Gas supply⌬
[
]
Because, you see, there are gigantic nebula around Auroraverse, that means Auroraverse spits out lots of its inner gas. If lost gases are not repaired to normal level, Auroraverse will act like balloon without inside pressure then collapse into tiny spec of dust. Luckily, gas is supplied from activity of center white hole.
⌬Satellites⌬
[
]
Satellites are something with mechanism resembling giant rechargable battery. The satellites are not really a verse, nor structure. It is a spot with huge gravity, but without any mass. Big bangs happen from
protoverses
very commonly at gravity zone, and gravity zone can accumulate energy.
Because energy capacity of satellites are not infinite, they have to release it to somewhere right? Other verses are too far away, other satellites say "gtfo we are also at verge of exploding" and emit electromagnetic pulses repeling any incoming energy. Then there is only one choice: Auroraverse.

Elemental gases
Special gases
Gases filling the Auroraverse is majorly krypton, but there are so many other inert gases! Other than bizarre gases with bizarre properties, Auroraverse gases are much more than that. Types of gases contained inside Auroraverse reaches number at non-understandable level. However, only few of gases are actually somewhat important.
⌬Elemental gases:
Total 99.1%
[
]
"Elemental" gases are the ones in periodic table. Four of those are responsible for 99.99994% of Auroraverse's glow. That means they are pretty much everything of Auroraverse. And it is true; Most important process to keep Auroraverse from deflating (?) are done by major 4 gases. Other than that, Elemental gases are just fat and useless inert gases sitting inside Auroraverse.
Oh one more note: how inert gases are not fusing then disintegrating into fragments at condition more extreme than core of neutron stars? Actually, Auroraverse's inert gases are not inert gas. Yes, that is drunk sentence, but seriously, particles making up the inert gases are something different than what it is in our universe!So yeah... these inert gases are only acting like inert gases.
⌬Krypton: 81%
[
]
In daily life, Krypton is inside flashlights. In Auroraverse, it is inside whatever-number-too-big-to-have-name sized verse. Density of krypton is close to its liquid form... but not liquid. Krypton does pretty much all job to keep Auroraverse safe from its satellites' attack. How? Well, nasty satellites of Auroraverse keeps injecting... "
Aight Imma head out
" level of energy into Auroraverse. If energy is not
bonked
back, Auroraverse is gonna explode.
High-density krypton absorbs almost all energy then perfectly radiates it back out. That way, Auroraverse don't crush into a point smaller than x button on mobile ADs then explode into nebula of inert gases, all because of satellites.
That'd be fun to watch tho
⌬Helium: 15%
[
]
Yes, THAT helium. You are thinking the right one: the one that is inside the floating balloons. Being the lightest and smallest inert gas particles, they are packed together so tightly under the pressure. Then compressed particles get excited by heat of krypton, then expands like crazy. So yeah, helium has not really a big role but to exert more pressure.
⌬Neon: 2%
[
]
Neon floats over krypton-helium mixture, meaning it is floating above the Auroraverse border. Neon is also the most actively produced gas of all. As soon as it is produced inside Auroraverse, it floats to go pile up above krypton-helium mixture. Because of that, majority of energy actually goes to piled-up neon, not to the mixture. Neon quickly gets blown away by heat expansion, and becomes the big red part of nebula.
Overall, neon's roll is to be blown away from Auroraverse to get rid of extra energy. This also has effect of correcting the energy level; if too much energy comes from satellite,
⌬Argon: 1%
[
]
Argon is not needed for Auroraverse. Or rather, Argon is a product of Neon radiating from auroraverse then its structure being changed when passing through gravitational spots. Usually, "atoms" of Auroraverse gases disintegrate into countless particles when exposed to big energy. When "atoms" of Auroraverse gases are inside the gravity zone of Auroraverse satellites, they turn into argon.
This draws long tail of argon behind the satellites, mixing the colors. It does not do anything bad, so argon is pretty irrelevant gas.
⌬Other elemental gases: 0.1%
[
]
Hydrogen
and other lightweight gases such as
Fluorine
and
Chlorine
, are product of big inert gas atoms (ex. Krypton) decaying from heat, slowly over millions of years. Not even need to mention how those three nasty gases
will act
inside Auroraverse's heat. Next is pretty much all
Halogens
,
Xenon
and
Radon
. They are at least more stable (not in terms of structures, interaction with Auroraverse), and is made by fusion of heavy inert gases. Although xenon is inert gas, auroraverse does not like heavier inert gases than major four.
Other gases (such as vaporized
uranium
) can form individual verse-like conditions, while majority of them are yeeted into bursting flames.
⌬Special gases:
Total 0.9%
[
]
Not really "special" gases. they do some work for Auroraverse other than keeping it inflated. Works are majorly small, specialized work to keep or continuously run other parts of Auroraverse.
⌬Radioa
ctive
metal
vapor:
0.602%
[
]
The name says all about how unhealthy it is. Rarely, random krypton particles can be crammed into ridiculously small space, mainly because of energy. Fusion energy is close to energy capacity of NOKIA (it's a lie. HORRENDOUS hyperbole), instantly evaporating fusion product. It means they are really rare, and has lots of neat functions.
Not only Radioactive metal vapor stops lives from conquering the Auroraverse (it is actually unintended feature), they have a role to overload gases of Auroraverse. Why? Because Radioactive metal vapor is very useless toxic gases only contributing more destruction to Auroraverse. And these vapors cannot even be rejected easily! so metal vapors are cancer to Auroraverse.
⌬Ill
umin
ari
on:
0.298%
[
]
Illuminarion is a mysterious gas with impossible (not literal. Metaphor in this case) "atomic" structure. Even though it only consists of 0.002% of Auroraverse gas, it radiates 30% of total radiation energy of Auroraverse. that means this gas is really not friend with energy, because as soon as energy comes in, the illuminarion radiates it away immediately.
