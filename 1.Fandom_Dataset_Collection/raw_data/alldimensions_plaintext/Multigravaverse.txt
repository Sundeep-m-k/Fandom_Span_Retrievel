Multigravaverses
are multiverse-like to
Gravastars
, and each different universe (
gravaverse
) has different gravitional laws. At the edges of a multigravaverse, there's something. Not a star, not a verse, but mysterious gravitional voids are pulling everything close to them. These multiverses are generally not a normal one, becaus everything inside is gravitionally bounded by voids.
