The
Orangerverse
is fairly similar to the
Orangeverse
. However, it is much more orange. Side effects of entering the orangerverse include malfunction of opponency cells so only orange can be seen, carotenosis, a citrusy taste in the mouth, and excessive vomiting up of whole uncut oranges. It is a very dangerous verse that people should stay away from.
