Earth 2
is a large, rocky
planet
in a
universe
which shares the same
Metaverse
as
ours
. Most of its characteristics are the same as our
Earth
, except the size, which is two earth sizes, and the density, which is half of the Earth's density to account for the larger size. Most of the new area created by this size has been filled with new continents, seen on the map.
For a timeline of its history, see
Earth 2/Timeline
.
Earth 2's lifeforms don't really differ from the normal Earth's lifeforms, except for some added ones like Slimes and more intelligent lifeforms that aren't humans.

Mushroom Kingdom: Humans, Koopas, Toads
Spaghettia: Humans
Fish Territory: Fish people
PolloLand: Sapient chickens that speak spanish
Portugal 2: Humans
Dumbassworld: (Stupid) humans, however there are also BFDI objects at the Goiky Canal

Europe doesn't have any relevant changes from Earth 1, except for some new political changes:
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are back (OH YES)
Scotland is independent
Ireland is unified
tl;dr: apparently i don't like UK very much
Same as Europe.
Korea is unified
Again, the same as Europe and Asia:
Texas is independent
To account for this, Puerto Rico is a state
nothing happened
There's a new lake! Lake moron!
Not actually the mushroom kingdom. Was just a normal landmass before, but a portal to the actual mushroom kingdom fell down from space and some toads went through and colonized this landmass, making it a colony of the Mushroom Kingdom
A continent where everybody can make exquisite spaghetti's! there's a bajillion different types, and every outsider considers the spaghetti "the best freaking food i've ever eaten".
Not actually a continent. Just an ocean, but most of fish civilization is here.
A continent entirely inhabited by chickens who speak spanish, they have chicken coop cities
A continent with dumb people, however there is a small not-dumb zone which contains the goiky canal (OMG BFDI!!!11)
Just a continent with some extra countries. Nothing special.
Continent unintentionally created by fractalies when they were making their presence in this planet. They have very high concentration of
thuons
so only fractalies can go to the inland and not die.
Africa but better
Indonesia but better
A continent where everybody is prepared for the holidays!
Just a country where people fart. Nothing much lmao
An arquipelago, this is the only place where there are epik ducks
