The trefoilverse is a -verse that is shaped like a trefoil knot. It is constructed from objects in
The Metahyperchain
, and it contains itself.
Trefoilverses move at very fast speeds, near the speed of light.
Rare events
[
]
Because trefoilverses are so fast, they sometimes collide with each other, expanding in a similar way that
Möbiverses
do, creating a Figure-Eightverse.
Trefoilverses are orange because -verses in The Metahyperchain glow blue, so when they collide they create orange light. Sometimes, trefoilverses are large enough that -verses don't collide with each other, and so it glows blue because of collective glowing.
