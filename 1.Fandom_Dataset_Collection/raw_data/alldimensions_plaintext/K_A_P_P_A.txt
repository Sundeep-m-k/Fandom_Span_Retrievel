W O R L D
K A P P A S
are pretty much
solar system
equivalents for the
W O R L Ds.
Also, they could contain some
R E F T E R S Fs
. Like
the Tesseract Systems
, K A P P A S are also artificial as well. It also causes the W O R L D S to move.
K A P P As float around the
ALLCAPSVERSES
, which are basically a W O R L D equivalent of an
universe
. A K A P P A should contain at most 100 W O R L Ds, since if there were a higher amount than that, the K A P P A would destablize.
Between each W O R L D is an extremely toxic gas that can kill most entities except for the highest of gods. Contrary to popular belief, this gas is not
Toxicium
.
K A P P A S have a core which holds all of the W O R L D S in place. This core resembles a star, but has insane amounts of gravity not possible on a W O R L D.
K A P P A S taste good, but they're deadly so donâ€™t eat them.
