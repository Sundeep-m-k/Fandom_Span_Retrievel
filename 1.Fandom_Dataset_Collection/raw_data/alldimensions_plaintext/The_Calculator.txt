The Calculator (
badcaf
or badcaf in
the Pencil Language
, ⊁≑⋉ in Calculese) is a somewhat unknown pre-
Omniversal
object that can change its properties, appearance, and size to different entities. It always appears as a calculator no matter what, though. It has a miniature version of the
Energyverse
filled to the brim with class U stars and superstructures connected to The Calculator harvesting them as an energy source, and miniature copies of the
Energy Production Void
being utilized by The Calculator as an energy source, with all of the
White Energy Particles
and
Black Energy Particles
contained by the
Energy Production Void
copies being made to collide every
voidsecond
. There are also miniature copies of
many
different
computer
-
related
verses
, with all of their processing power repurposed towards calculating power for The Calculator. These verses seem to have been copied with a quality way better than
The Ripoff
or any other 'verse copier'; apart from certain changes, a verse in The Calculator is identical to the verse it is based off of.
The Calculator is able to calculate any function, math expression, conjecture, hypothesis, question relating to mathematics, etc. within
voidseconds
! It has no overflow limit, it is able to compute uncomputable numbers, and the only error you may run into is a syntax error for incorrectly typing a function. It is also able to calculate infinite numbers. Its answer will appear in the script used most by the viewer, including dialects.

Rules over
The Calculator
Goals
To keep The Calculator in working order
Calculator Upkeepers (⊁≑⋉ ≼⊣⊼⋀⋶≇ in Calculese) are entities which inhabit The Calculator. As the name suggests, they keep The Calculator in working order. They will often fix the "buttons" of The Calculator and assign themselves to certain Perceptions to fix. One theorized lowerbound on the number of Calculator Upkeepers is 1,280,050,000,000,000,000. They are composed of many different species, including but not limited to
humans
, many different sapient creatures from many different
Universes
, including the
humans
' own
[

]
,
Sentient Substance
,
Pencils
, etc
[
3
]
. In total, there are 1,658 different known species that have been cataloged to be Calculator Upkeepers, incluiding 23 otherwise extinct species in other
Universes
. They do not require any sustenance, and can live for many OYC. They are inherently very proficient in mathamatics, and are able to solve even hard problems very easily, even if the Calculator Upkeeper in question is young and/or mentally disabled.
[

]
The only way for more Calculator Upkeepers to exist is for two Calculator Upkeeper parents to birth a child. These children are taught written and spoken Calculese and how to be a "good" Calculator Upkeeper by their parents. Calculator Upkeeper parents will "reject" non-Calculator Upkeeper-born children, mostly pretending the child does not exist and not caring for it. They will also try to provide the child to any non-Calculator Upkeepers passing by. Similarly, Calculator Upkeeper children will "reject" non-Calculator Upkeeper adults, ignoring anything any non-Calculator Upkeeper creatures say. In a similar vein, Calculator Upkeeper adults will refuse to do… with other Calculator Upkeeper Adults. The DNA or equivalent of a Calculator Upkeeper is mostly identical to its base species, with some mostly negligible changes.
Calculese
[
]
Calculator Upkeepers speak a previously unknown language known as Calculese (⊁≑⋉ ⨛⋎≝⊕∽⊀≥⨠ in Calculese). Calculese is composed of math symbols verbally said. There seems to be multiple dialects of Calculese including English Calculese, Spanish Calculese, Greek Calculese, Latin Calculese,
Pencil
Calculese, etc. Something to note is that different dialects of languages, and the accents that come with them also occur, although it doesn’t make much difference. This also occurs with the written form of Calculese, although technically it only occurs with the written out symbols, Morse code, Braille and sign language forms. The written form of Calculese seems to be composed entirely of mathematical symbols
[
5
]
such as the string "⊿∿√÷⊸", which is the only way for speakers of different dialects of Calculese to communicate effectively. Strings of Calculese do not match any real mathematical equation, and seem to be random mathematical symbols The other version is the dialect's language's words written out such as "Right triangle sine wave radical division multimap"
[
6
]
.  This written version is less common than writting down mathematical symbols. Each dialect strangly has their own language's morse code, braillie, and sign language, used very rarely, more rarely than even writing the words out. These three mentioned before act exactly like their base language, although they are exclusively used to construct words with Calculese, similarly to writing words out in Calculese dialects. Even though their words are composed entirely of familiar symbols and words, it can take tens of years to understand
[
7
]
. Calculator Upkeepers' names are strings of Calculese, and like regular Calculese, do not seem to correspond to any known/valid mathematics. (Note: There was a comment from a
TOG
known as "
Universe2011
" that read "You can never make me make a conlang of this! You can do it if you want, I don’t care!". Further research revealed that a "conlang" from our Universe stood for "constructed language", which is a language created artificially, instead of naturally. Significance unknown. Further research into source of edit revealed DATA LOST our Universe DATA LOST omnipotent DATA LOST "Fandom" DATA LOST

Incidents
[
]
Preface
[
]
The Calculator, like many other verses and cosmic objects, has had its fair share of incidents and problems. This section of the page aims to catalog every incident that has happened at The Calculator whether it be major or minor. You can add your own if you want! Make sure it goes in chronological order.
The Incident of -205 OYC
[
]
By
Universe2011
The Calculator Upkeeper ∏∊⊐±⨳⪚⦰ was repairing the 93726.298273eth root button when a previously unknown creature
[
8
]
appeared through a portal, approached ∏∊⊐±⨳⪚⦰ and deleted all biological traces of her from existence. This was found to have happened to approx. 123,456,000 other Calculator Upkeepers, including the "great" ⪣⊫⋱⊀⊀⊀∩. The reduced amount of Calculator Upkeepers led to a reduced quality of answers provided by The Calculator, with some notable examples including 2 + 2 equaling 5 and all answers for a period of 1.35
OYC
being similar to the answers that can be provided by an item known as a “magic 8-ball
[
9
]
” from our Universe, and only appearing in English. Translation efforts for the 8-ball answers and other English-only answers were ongoing for about 8.96 OYC, until the language was discovered in some Universes. It took approximately 202 OYC for The Calculator to be repaired, and about 6.5 OYC to fix the population dip in Calculator Upkeepers. When The Calculator was fully repaired from this incident, a party was held for the achievement. One Calculator Upkeeper, ⊢∵⨘∱⊄∀≪∐, was celebrated especially due to his diligence and repairing of major parts of the Calculator.

The Incident of 2125 OYC
[
]
by
DiggyPT
Roe
teleported onto the Calculator and instantly sent 1,732 Calculator Upkeepers into its
basement
. It then decided to eat the concept of the number 14. The laws around the Calculator were modified to remove any trace of the number 14, and all entities on or around the Calculator forgot that 14 existed. This means that all answers that the Calculator gave were devoid of 14. 6 OYC passed before this discrepancy was noticed, when an entity that was too far to be affected by the 14-purge when it happened decided to use the Calculator. The instant they pressed 1 and 4 (which nobody thought of doing before), a logical black hole was created, that reverted the changes to all of the laws.
The U-018^19_=* Incident of 3828 OYC
[
]
By
Universe2011
Pictured in the infobox image. The Calculator brushed up against a very bright verse, now cataloged as "U-018^19_=*", which caused minor charring damage to the exterior of all perceptions of The Calculator. However, there were over 185,000 deaths from the incident, with about 45% being Calculator Upkeepers.
The Incident of 3862 OYC
[
]
By
DiggyPT
The Calculator was hit by a large object made entirely out of
cuanday
approximately 0.04 light years large referred to today as O-Cn53. O-Cn53 started reacting in a previously unknown way with the elements found in the surface of The Calculator
[
13
]
turning the entirety of The Calculator temporarily into
cuandaic acid
which dissolved a large region of The Calculator. This changed up The Calculator in a way similar to the incident of -205 OYC, such as changing the language to Portuguese to any viewer, no matter their native language. Since none of the Calculator Upkeepers dared to damage it this led to a period of 4.42 OYC where the TOG known as
DiggyPT
had to try to operate The Calculator as he was the only known available entity that understands Portuguese, at the time.

Calculable Measurements
[
]
Calculable measurements are a subtype of perceptions which alter not only sight of beings and operable cameras, but measurements by measurement tools (thermometer, glitchometer, existenometer, Geiger counters, etc.) This does not include rulers or any other size measurement tool.

Regular Calculations
[

Note: Somehow, some of the part of the hard drive for this verse that contained the answers for the following calculations was destroyed. It is unknown how this happened, but nothing else was damaged, except for any material referencing the answers given, and there was no evidence left behind by the perpetrator. It is unknown why some answers were left uncorrupted, and why other answers were
[

]
Despite the nature of the damage, the hard drive still worked as intended, and no other data was corrupted or the like.

'rotaluclaC ehT'
[
]
The structure nicknamed 'RotaluclaC ehT' is a structure almost identical to The Calculator, but reversed, located in The Calculator. It was discovered in 718 OYC by Calculator Upkeeper ⨛⊆∟⊬⊎⩡⫁ when they were doing a routine check of the entirety of The Calculator. Any perceptions of The Calculator are the same in 'rotaluclaC ehT', but with their color inverted, and shape upside down and flipped. ⨛⊆∟⊬⊎⩡⫁ also reported seeing 'inverted' versions of multiple Calculator Upkeepers they knew. They have not elaborated on what they mean by 'inverted'. These 'inverted' Calculator Upkeepers have not been seen or reported since.
The following document was found with 'rotaluclaC ehT'.

For example, 3 year old Calculator Upkeeper was once shown a calculus level problem, told to find the solution, and he solved it in around 100 seconds. It should be noted that in the base species of this particular Calculator Upkeeper, 3 year olds are still developing and not very smart yet.

No known elements have had the same reaction to
Cuanday
as the events witnessed on The Calculator. The only reactions that were even remotely similar were controlled tests between Cuanday and parts of The Calculator.
↑
At the time, no Calculator Upkeepers who spoke Portuguese Calculese had the experience and/or courage to fix The Calculator in its then-current state, as it was very complicated and would've had an approximately 97.182631725% chance of destroying or irreparably damaging The Calculator.
