Structure
[
]
Mindenspheres are huge, verse-like structures. They bear a resemblance to the Allsphere, which was formerly a Mindensphere. They are made up of Veraverses, which are large, oval-shaped verses. Mindenspheres are made up of two parts: the Rhombi Webs and the Veravoids.
Rhombi Webs
[
]
The Rhombi Webs are long, web-like structures that reside in the Mindensphere. They are in the shape of a rhombus. The reason for this is that during the creation of Minden, the Omni-blood from the
Omnicreator
caused the Mindenspheres to form, which then caused the Omni-blood to try and reform(the blood cells are in the shape of a rhombus). This caused the Rhombi Webs to be created. The Veraverses reside in this structure. Some of the Rhombi Webs also have hot-spots, which are very hot areas in which Veraverses cannot exist, other than Vera-Infernin, a distorted Veraverse that became extremely hot.
Veravoids
[
]
The Veravoids are
very
weird places. The Veravoids were created when distorted Omni-blood cells became distorted and turned into very cold blobs. If something is to enter these Voids, it begins to deconstruct to a point where it's
Tinyparticles
will split apart and turn into
Veraparticles
. These Veraparticles will create small explosions that fuel the Veravoids and make them expand. This is why it is very rare to see Mindenspheres with less than 1% void percentage.
Entities
[
]
There are multiple entities that rule other Mindenspheres in our local Minden. These entities were created due to the leftover Omnid-blood from the Omnicreator.
Ythothan
[
]
Ythothan is the strongest entity in our Minden. He rules over the largest Mindensphere in our Minden. He is known for looking like a humanoid chicken(I doubt anyone will get the reference). He once looked beyond his Mindensphere, only to find more of them. He once used his full potential to look beyond Minden itself, only to see the Omnicreator. This made Ythothan paranoid.
Tyvius
[
]
Tyvius is the ruler of one of the first Mindenspheres in our Minden. He was the first entity in Minden to come into existence.
