"The thought... that one day, the wiki will be no more... it terrifies me."
The Inevitable is the idea that one day, the entire wiki will be gone and forgotten, with every single contributor that came to this wiki dead. The wiki will have no activity, with the last edit being literal centuries ago. This is guaranteed to happen, as one day, either the wiki will no longer be interesting or we as the human species dies out, thus pointing to the name "The Inevitable".
Right now, the wiki is active, with many contributors and a constant stream of edits, comments, and discussion posts. However, people might leave the wiki. They might stop editing here due to either personal problems, work, or their eventual death. The best we can do is to sustain this careful balance of editors, edits, and pages.
You, having a short life of at most just a century, will probably not see the end of the wiki. You might just leave the wiki before it dies. Thus you will not witness the inevitable doom of this community. Does that mean you are a coward, not wanting to watch the inevitable? Stare at the countless edits made, and try to revive the wiki when it is beyond repair? No. Not at all. You are a person, you need food, water, shelter, money, a good job, and much more. You will eventually leave the wiki to do other things just like most of the contributors that stepped foot onto AD soil.
Compare this to the total number of humans born. Over a hundred billion humans have been conceived, but only around 7 ~ 8 billion people are alive today. Just like the inactive contributors and the active ones. There are way less active editors than inactive editors.
So, what will we do when the wiki is dead? There are many more cosmology wikis out there that people can simply join. Just don't forget about this one.
