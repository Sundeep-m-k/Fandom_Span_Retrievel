Structure
[
]
The Factor is one of the most, if not the most orderly verse in the entire
Omniverse
. It is divided into many sections, each for a certain purpose.
The Creating Section
[
]
This section is for creating verses, and takes up approximately 55% of The Factor's space. This area is very busy, and is divided into 4 subsections.
The Archverse Section
[
]
This section is the Archverse Section. It takes up about 57% of the space in the Creating Section, and is the biggest and busiest section, as there are well over 26 different types of Archverses, and all of the are nested in one another.
However, this section is one of the least valued sections, due to almost all the Archverses being very empty, dull, and boring with almost nothing to separate them from each other.
The Special Verses Section
[
]
This section is the least busiest, but is the most valued. Many extremely useful verses have been created here, such as the
Diamondverse
,
Energyverse
, and
Matterverse
. Not a lot of verses are created here, since special verses take a long time to create, and use up lots of energy.
The Regular Verses Section
[
]
This section is responsible for creating all the "normal verses", such as a
Universe
,
Multiverse
,
Metaverse
,
Hyperverse
, and so on. Basically, this section creates all verses that are not Archverses, special verses, or Verseverses.
The Verseverse Section
[
]
This is the least valued section, and has only been used to create massive void-like structures called "Verseverses". These Verseverses are really just huge empty voids, and are even more empty than the Archverses.
This subsection is starting to be demolished and converted into another Regular Verses Section due to this section's complete and utter uselessness.
The Destroying Section
[
]
This section is the second section of The Factor. The Destroying Section is slightly smaller than its counterpart, The Creating Section, taking up about 45% of the space inside The Factor.
This area is also less busy than the Creating Section, since many verses don't need to be destroyed.
The Verses Section
[
]
This subsection of The Destroying Section is for destroying verses. Most of the verses that get recycled here are Archverse copies and Verseverses, as both types are extremely useless. This section is also the busiest subsection of The Destroying Section.
The Anomaly Section
[
]
This section is less busy than the Verses Section, but it is still quite busy. Each day, many strange anomalies such as stray verses,
Sproyongs
, rogue black holes, and glitchy verses are destroyed here. Working at this section is quite dangerous, since many anomalies have the power to kill unsuspecting workers.
