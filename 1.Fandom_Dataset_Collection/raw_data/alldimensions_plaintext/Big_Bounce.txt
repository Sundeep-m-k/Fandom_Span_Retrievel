The
Big Bounce
is a hypothetical scenario of the
universes
.
It says that after a
Big Crunch
, the affected universe is compressed down to a
Protoverse
, which subsequently triggers another
Big Bang.
This cycle then repeats either forever or until another universe-ending scenario occurs and cancels that universe's Big Bounce. Bounces may explain what happened before the Universe, however if a body containing a universe has a finite lifespan, something must have triggered said Big Bounce initially.
