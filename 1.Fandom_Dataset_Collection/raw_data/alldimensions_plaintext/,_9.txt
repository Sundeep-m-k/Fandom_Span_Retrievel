, 9 (also called Commanine) is a type of verse that exists in nearly every reality somewhere. It is the main source of unbreakable material, and the place where most cosmic entities are generated.
Structure and Material
[
]
, 9 has no material, but it has matter. However, it still isn't even made from abstract material, proven by ╲╳╳︱︱╱╲╲╲╳. This means that , 9 is made of pure matter, instead of abstract matter.
Difference between abstract material and pure matter
[
]
While abstract material and pure matter are very similar, pure matter still retains the fundamental laws of matter while abstract material disregards that and is the most neutral substance possible.
The middle of , 9 is a replica of
.`;,```;,``;.,`.`;.`,`.`,;.`,`,.`;.,`.;,`
, which has the same properties as one, but where "existence" is instead the , 9. This object allows the , 9 to stay stable under any amount of pressure, due to the
.`;,```;,``;.,`.`;.`,`.`,;.`,`,.`;.,`.;,`
replica's near-infinite gravity.
Cosmic Entity Generator
[
]
The Cosmic Entity Generator generates the cosmic entity, obviously. However, the cosmic entity it generates is always the cosmic entity that fits perfectly with the reality it is in. It does this because it can detect which
isn't
fit for the reality, due to its ability to sense everything around it. The generator's math is to place every factor that makes a cosmic entity not fit for a reality on an infinite dimensional space, each one being a point. Then, it finds the cosmic entity that would be furthest away from every point in the space, and that would be the cosmic entity that it generates.
It creates these entities by using the infinite gravity to pull random atoms into the core and to create the cosmic entity that is furthest away from the negative factors. After this, a cosmic entity exists. This is how most cosmic entities are created in the first place.
