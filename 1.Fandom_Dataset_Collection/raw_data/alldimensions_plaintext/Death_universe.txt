A
Death universe
is a normal
Universe
, whose laws have been set, either naturally or artificially, in such a way, that when anything enters in it, it ceases to live.
These
Death universes
do not actually exist, they are merely thought experiments, as having a Universe cease any life whatsoever that enters it,
is impossible
, due to how technologically advanced some creatures are, and even ones at the lower spectrum of this scale could withstand
many such verses
.
The Death universe's counterpart, the
Life universe
, is a verse that when collided with the
Death universe
, produces a
"normal universe"
. This definition is very arbitrary, and highlights how the Death universe is only just a thought experiment.
Equivalents, but not specifically
Death universes
, include any verses which one could consider having extreme properties, like extreme
Eisler values
, or extreme temperature, or
black holes
, for example.
