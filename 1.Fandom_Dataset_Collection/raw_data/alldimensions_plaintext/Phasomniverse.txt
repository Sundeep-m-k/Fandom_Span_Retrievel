Omnipoverses
The
Phasomniverse
is a gargantuan verse that is renowned for its "fire hills", formations constructed from
Omnipoverses
that take on an orange color when using extremely advanced imaging technology. Unlike the
Omnipoverse
, the Phasomniverse has some voids and is not 100% filled. On a post-alphasmic scale, the Phasomniverse can be compared to a nucleon (proton or neutron) as it makes up a larger structure named after the atom known as the
Omnatom
.
Axolotl
currently resides within a Phasomniverse and enjoys swimming through the various bizzarre formations within it.
Phasomniverses also vary drastically from each other with the possible arrangements of fire hills being infinite. The types of Phasomniverses within an
Omnatom
help to define its properties. Due to this, there are also infinite omnelements (the post-alphasmic equivalent of elements).
