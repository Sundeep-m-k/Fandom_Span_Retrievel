The Absolute Stop Sign
is a very large
verse
that is shaped like an infinite number of stop signs, possibly made to try and 'stop' very powerful cosmic entities from getting into larger verses. It is built is from many
Absolute Cubes
built into an octagonal shape, and is found within
The Absolute Truth
.
It stores a lot of information from the text in the middle of it, most of it saying 'stop' or something similar in many languages, but there is some other information in it too.
Structure
[
]
The Absolute Stop Sign has a single central stop sign that has a 'pole' coming out from the bottom of it. It goes down so far that we have not been able to see the end of it, or what it connects to. All the other stop signs stick to the main, central stop sign, with there being an infinite chain of stop signs in both directions.
