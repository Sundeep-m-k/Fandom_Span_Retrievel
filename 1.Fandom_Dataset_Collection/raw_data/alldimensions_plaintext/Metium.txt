Metiums
are abstractly smaller than
Nonons
, and are "purple" Nonat particles made out of Mettium element. They're also not active compared to a Nonon. As they're recorded to be really hot, zero entities live here.
Information of a Metium is very scarce, so this page will contain all of that information we have.

Nullology
[
]
Nullity in this scale is scarcely low; as nullity phases through abstraction with high decomposition. It tells us the tree of nullology mathematics; sometimes inaccessible to normal
Axions
. Mostly, it is inaccessible to properties except in the meta-mathematical scale; which has a equation assuming null and alt-null predictates. This equation shows that these assumptions are infinitary, not just binary, ternary, and so forth; loosely connecting from each other.
Cancellation, concentration, and assignation are alien, only due to "glitchy." When it stops glitching, stability increases; allowing Mettium to be merged into Nonium and to be more accessible to null from prior mathematics. Although, they can combine into other Nonat Particles assuming alt-null subtruths and non-binary logic dependent on stability.
Stability
[
]
Stability of a Metium actually consists of mysterious subtruth matrices assuming "stability," which is why many Nonat particles merge into other kinds regardless of nonorderly sizes. These are directly connected to alt-null branches of nullology mathematics and really hard to sustain by operators. It also applies to abnormal mathematics of abstraction / logic by extent.
Mettium
[
]
Mettium, known as Metiumium, is the only element that exists in Metiums. Mettium forms when Nonium decays or a Nonoon decays from death. When enough Mettium is in one place, it forms a Metium.
Mettium is naturally purple, which is why Metiums are purple. The reason why it is so hot is because a Metium forms when there is almost too much unstability and Mettium in one place, and that makes things very hot. And that's why Metiums are naturally very hot.
Stability
[
]
Believe it or not, at such a small size at this point, you might expect it to collapse immediately. But so far, most Nonons and Metiums are surprisingly stable. Lasting for entire
OYC's
before collapsing.
