The Third Realm.
Housing even the immmense power of beings like
Alphasm
, much is unknown about this place. In fact, by definition, It is above all we could possibly know, except the little bits collected from talking with near-acendent beings. Not much is known about the third realm itself, but we do know what stops us from reaching it.
Now let me tell you a story...
Transfictional Barriers
[
]
Transfictional barriers, also known as
Fourth Walls,
are conceptual laws that stop beings of different "Fictions" from interacting with each other. Think
Existence Ranks,
but on a unimaginably cosmic scale. The conceputal jump from our reality to a higher level of transfictionality, is like a character from your favorite TV show or video game jumping out of the screen.
Almost impossible. In fact, to anything below the third realm, the third realm is like what
The Wheel
is to a
Â·
.
There are also
sub-transfictional barriers.
Some examples of these are
Boxes
,
Finality Containers
, and Subfinality Containers. In fact, each Transfictional Barrier is made up of an infinite amount of Sub-Transfictional Barriers.
The most stunning revelation is   these are dimensions created by the alphasm outside of its mind. That is, he can make alphasm fantasy dimensions  and hide them on the street.

(This is seriously the only page to have a conclusion other than some long joke page?... Ok.)
In conclusion, the Third Realm is a unknown a mysterious place that keeps us from entering via a impenetrable conceptual barrier.
Of course there's more realms. In fact, we are even aware of more realms. But this is a benchmark for verses, realms, and almost everything else.
