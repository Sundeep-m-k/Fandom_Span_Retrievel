Roe likes fish food, but if there's no fish food nearby it will eat some random entity in its own basement. Roe doesn't really need food, but they eat food for fun.

Roe's Bag
[
]
Roe's Bag is the object that contains its basement. It uses non-euclidean law
particles
to be able to trap an infinite space in a finite object, much like how an infinite holocircle/sphere can exist in a hyperbolic space. Sometimes, Roe's Bag is physically attached to Roe.
