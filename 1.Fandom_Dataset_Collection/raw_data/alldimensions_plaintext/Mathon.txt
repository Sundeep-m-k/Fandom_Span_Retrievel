A
Mathon
is the largest structure in
Class -2
, and is a hybrid between the more concrete area of particles/the more abstract area of numbers. This is due to its position in
H(-2)
, which has a description of:
"Abstract dimensions, a strange blend of mathematics and objects. Particles embodying mathematical concepts, are a common sight here."

Due to being semi-abstract, it can just flow through basically anything as if it wasn't there. However, if the force exerted on a Mathon is greater than the force the Mathon exerts, then the Mathon will collapse into an imaginary concept. There is no way to get it out of this form, apart from entities like
Alphasm
that can convert imagination into objects.
Mathons also have a density high enough that the
Endfinities
and other
Numbars
contained within Mathon, do not escape. This is due to the fact that they are way more abstract, and therefore would otherwise collapse into a theory within less than a second.
