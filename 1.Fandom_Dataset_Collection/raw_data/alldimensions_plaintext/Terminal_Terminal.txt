The
Terminal Terminal
is a verse and terminal object composed of 5 rectangular prisms of equal shape, but different size. It uses
Glomes
as a way to store information, and is programmed by a cosmic entity called
The Programmer
.
Properties
[
]
The Terminal Terminal is, being a terminal object, shaped like a certain thing, in this case a computer terminal. It is
extremely
efficient at storing information, with each rectangular prism or 'subterminal' being used for a different reason. Here is what each one does (by size)
Main calculation area and storage for the Terminal Terminal. Also helps communication between subterminals.
Designed for mathematical calculations, but mostly more simple ones.
Works with text, display, and retracing tools.
Has a screen which is viewable from the smallest subterminal.
Has a way to input data and actually use the terminal, also deals with advanced mathematical calculations.
Usage
[

The Terminal Terminal is an
extremely
good at processing, even better than even
most extremely good computers
. It has a processing power even larger than

yottahertz and over

{\displaystyle \infin(1,0)}
zettabytes and is even able to simulate itself! The only downside is that only The Programmer knows how to use the Terminal Terminal correctly, and is not willing to give any information of how to use it.
It can also simulate any computer system, and so can also run
.verse files
on
verse.exe
, and can even compute any .verse file in at most 1
OYC
, at least according to The Programmer.
