The Linguist
[
]
The Linguist is the ruler of the Taviverse, and he is capable of describing absolutely everything due to his incredible skills with language. The Linguist's power comes from words, as anything he says happens, at least within the Taviverse. The Linguist's true form is a word that transcends all describablility. Outside of the Taviverse, The Linguist is powerless.
