The fight
[
]
The fight beetween the light and the dark, The light at the end lost (why the universe is black) but in some other universe like neonverse is all white and neony because of the fact theres the light won thew dark but the dark have won on our universe, which created most universes black because we are the matter for the other universes, after all we were the 657,875K universe to be created (a very early universe) while aliens are more developed because they are like the 23,875K universe or something like that, but if the universe that starts, starts as being the 7,621,654,985,123,543,687 Universe (7 Quintillion'th verse) the light would've won because the light developed more quickly than the dark while the dark won and became stronger than the dark, tho it will be still in our universe anti-matter (dark matter) forever.
The reason
[

But wait.. Why is the reason for the fight?
well, the simple answer is:
no one knows, but we did a research and the reason is, you see, if the light wouldve won, all the light will turn in our universe while when the darkness won it wont be completely black which means the dark would needed to won to create our universe.

if the light wouldve won, it would take over the dark completely, which will break the
Yin and Yang
physics and make it impossible to create life, after all darkness and lightness needs to be always alive to create life, while the darkness won, its wouldve take only 84% of the universe making it black, and not all which makes the yin and yang still alive, which allows to create life.

If the light would won, it would destroy yin and yang, making it impossible to make life, but the dark won, and didnt break yin and yang, making it possible to make life and because of the darkness we are still alive.
So who is the real Hero and who is the real villian?
