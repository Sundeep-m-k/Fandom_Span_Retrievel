The
Authorized-verse
are universes authorized by the gods that have extreme laws and quantum physics that prevent the universes from being reused by other gods who have already authorized it. This is applied mostly by the original authors and creators of existence who know of that universe (described as numbers greater than 10^33 and 57^01; which are used between entities and universes that already existed). There can be changes in these universes and the original articles and documents are not used and instead can be used by anyone (meaning that the original articles and documents are more efficient to develop the procedure of the quantity 10^33 and 57^01).
Main Continuity
[
]
It depends on the universe. The main continuity is based on the structure of the universe and if it is less than 10^33 it is not able to obtain the main continuity; The main continuity is a way of ordering the universes that are already Authorized and from 57^01 to 10^33 the universes of these numbers make drastic changes forming a structure of up to a thousand existing ones. Its authorized authors and gods are not included in this and all of the main continuity serves in potential.
