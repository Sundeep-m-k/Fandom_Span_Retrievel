The cosmic council is a group of gods who rule over the box. They decide the laws of the box, can declare wars on other boxes, and can banish people from the box, as well as visiting with other cosmic councils to decide on forming alliances, and even more stuff. They are able to easily leave the box and even the cetaverse if they want, and can destroy hyperverses effortlessly. They are also able to destroy omniverses. The cosmic council is overall very important to the box. Coincidentally, there are no girls that are members of the cosmic council.

Supergod is one of the 5 gods of the cosmic council. He is one of the strongest ones, and wants to overthrow kingigagon and to become the leader of the cosmic council. Because of this, he is enemies with Kingigagon. Kingigagon can’t kick him out however, as the rest of the council don’t want him kicked out.

Powerzilla always votes yes on going to war. Powerzilla wants only to dominate and destroy. This may seem like chaotic evil, but he is more of a chaotic neutral and has been ever since joining the cosmic council (Before that he was more of a neutral evil). He is the dumbest member of the council, and he is always angry and naturally shoots lightning bolts everywhere uncontrollably.

Godrill is the smartest and most peaceful member by far, and is a giant sentient nigh-omnipotent drill mech. Him and Powerzilla HATE each other. Godrill also always votes no for war and yes for an alliance. Godrill has actually never killed anybody, which is insane for an entity this strong. The reason for this is that he is a pacifist. He never even hurts anybody physically or mentally on purpose, not even a little bit. He is extremely smart, knowing pretty much everything, as if he was the all-knowing hexagon or something.
