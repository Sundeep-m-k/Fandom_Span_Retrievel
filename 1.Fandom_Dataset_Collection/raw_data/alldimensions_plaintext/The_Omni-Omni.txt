Position
Contained by:
Thes
Contains:
Nested Realities
and infinite other Nests.
The
Omni-Omnis
represent the last layer of the
Nested Realities
, and they contain everything that has the prefix "Omni" but is smaller than them. Don't confuse them with the
Omniverses
.
Life
[
]
Surprisingly, life does exist in Omni-Omnis; In ours, it comes in the form of
entities
such as the
Square beasts
,
Cube beasts
, and
Omni-Beasts
.
The Square beasts are the weakest of the beasts, only controlling 0.000096% of our Omni-Omni.  The Cube beasts can control 0.02% of the Omni-Omni instead, while the Omni-Beasts control 13.8% of our Omni-Omni.
The rest of the 86.2% of the Omni-Omni is controlled by a singular creature.  However, the creature has never taken an
Omni-Selfie
, so we don't have any
Omni-Clues
about it. They're rumored to be called
The Omni-Omni-Omni
, including the uppercase in "The".
Escaping them
[
]
There is nothing outside of the Omni-Omnis as we know of yet,
[

but some creatures HAVE tried to escape. For example, the Omni-Beasts created the first ever
Omni Class Spaceship
on our Omni-Omni, meaning it can travel an entire
Omni-Universe
In one second.  However, after 99,482,842,829 OYC's, the spaceship ran out of fuel. A few septillion Omni-Universes were traveled, and the lowest 17 layers of the
Nested Reality
were also exceeded.
Beyond them
[
]
Somehow, Omni-Omnis ARE contained by something. These things is known as
Thes
.
Thes
are completely unknown at this time, and once a picture and any form of reliable info is made, the article will be posted.
