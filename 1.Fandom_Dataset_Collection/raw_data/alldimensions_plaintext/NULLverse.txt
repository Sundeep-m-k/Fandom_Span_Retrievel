The
NULLverses
are the
universes
of error. They are made up of the
extreme glitchonicite
element
, which makes these
verses
unstable, though verses that contain NULLverses are so large they end up somewhat cancelling the glitchiness of the element. Example: They can sometimes affect a
Fake Pageverse
on a very small scale. In fact, they are so small that these affects are completely null for the latters.
However, if these verses never existed, then larger verses may not even be able to form as they serve to balance their stability.
If something or someone touches the barriers of this type of verse with enough force, it could create an explosion able of destroying everything within the diameter of a
Primordial String
at any time.
There are, of course different types of NULLverses. Most are normal with their glitches but some special variants could even be considered as anti-versions of NULLverses. In other cases, they might be so much more glichier which sometimes could end up making them self-destruct and spread their remains over their entire local
ERRORverses
.
Effects
[
]
There are, of course, no major destructions to verses like the Fake Pageverses and above. NULLverses are too small to do this as their maximum capacity can only make some things in the larger structures to move or get distorted in a very slight way.
If we are talking about smaller things like ERRORverses, then the effects can depend on which NULLverse type it is. At times, when a NULLverse is so corrupted it can affect its neighborhoods and maybe even their ERRORverse. There can be deposits of leftover matter when a NULLverse dies, which are like
stars
dying and turning into nebulae. Those deposits can still make glitches, but in a smaller scale.

NULLverse is one of the most powerful voids, because it is only 0.00001% matter, and the 'matter' is just letters. Fill in the void by
