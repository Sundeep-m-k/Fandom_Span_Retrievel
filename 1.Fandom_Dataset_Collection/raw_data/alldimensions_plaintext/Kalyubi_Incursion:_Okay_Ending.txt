The Kalyubi Incursion was a medium-scale invasion of
The Barrelplock.
which was carried out by the cosmic entity known as Ubbley Vios (also known as Ubbley Vio, Ubbley Vi, Ubbley V, Ubbley, Ubble, Ubbl, Ubb, Ub, or U), who had escaped the Kalyubi Dimension or something.
While the events of the Alomgated Triangular Bicupola still existed, the Kalyubi Incursion however maybe perchance possibly did not. As far as it is presumably known (perchance), the version 1.2.4 patch of Ubbley Vios fixed minor bugs such as the screen freezing during the Borwein integral operation and the chicken not moving when you press the spacebar.
The Kalyubi Incursion, was, an, event, so, destructive, and, devastating, that, it, never, could, have, been, dreamt, by, anyone, anywhere, ever, in the world. Find out why and how after these messages.

The Re-Rebirth of Ubbley Vios
The Rebirth of Ubbley Vios
[
]
Oh, you wanna know how Ubbley Vios rebirthed? Alright, then. It all started when Ubbley Vios died in an accident last year, but then, a bunch of people came to Ubbley Vios and found it on the ground. So, those people put kimchi into Ubbley Vios's backpack and then that brought Ubbley Vios back to life. Hooray for kimchi!
But that's not all. If you thought that was a good argument for kimchi, just you wait. If you put kimchi in the
bathtub
, the kimchi will not die (as opposed to a falcon who will die if you leave it in the bathtub for long enough). Sounds like a great deal. Wouldn't it be great if kimchi wasn't afraid of heights? Well, fear no more, because kimchi is indeed not afraid of heights. You don't need to imagine that. Tired of kimchi getting all over your shelves? Well, don't worry, kimchi will not get all over your shelves. Unless you place it there manually. But, like, you'll have to do that
intentionally
. If you don't do it intentionally, it probably won't get all over your shelves. Well, now that really sucks does it? (assuming you
do
want kimchi all over your shelves). Well, you don't actually need to put the kimchi on the shelves; you can take the shelf off and rub the shelf all over the kimchi. This will essentially result in the same effect. Although, you will have to put the shelf back on for full effect, so be wary of that if you plan to try this at home. Although, this all assumes you actually want the kimchi to get all over your shelves in the first place; you don't need to worry about doing any of this if you
don't
want that. Why would you want it anyway? (Oh, and by the way, if you only want to get kimchi on
some
parts of your shelves and not all of them, you can do the same thing, but for a shorter length of time. By default, the longer you spend putting kimchi on your shelves (or rubbing the shelf in the kimchi), the more kimchi will get on your shelves. Obviously, there are a few exceptions to this. For example, if you run out of kimchi, rubbing the shelf in kimchi will not put any more kimchi on the shelf.)
Escaping the Kalyubi Dimension
[
]
NOw that Ubbley Vios is back up and running again, doesn't that mean Ubbley Vios needs to escape the Kalyubi Dimension (or something)? So, here's how it was done. First, you draw a circle. Then, you take that circle and put it on top of Ubbley Vios. Next, Ubbley Vios says: "What is that?". Ignore this remark; this is expected and unavoidable. Now, here's the tricky part; you need to attach a magnet to the top of the sheet of paper that contains the circle. Please make sure to put the magnet in the exact centre of the circle. The top of Ubbley Vios is magnetic for some reason so you should be able to lift Ubbley Vios from there. You can use your local transit system (a train or hyper-train pod supercar that definitely isn't just a worse version of a train will do in most scenarios) to bring Ubbley Vios to the outside of the Kalyubi Dimension. Try not to bump Ubbley Vios into too many objects, as repeated collisions may hinder performance.
After you're done moving Ubbley Vios to outside the Kalyubi Dimension, you need to take the magnet and the circle off of Ubbley Vios. To do this, you need a few shims of wood. Put the shims between the piece of paper and the top of Ubbley Vios in order to separate the piece of paper from Ubbley Vios, and then you should be able to take the magnet off easier due to the material between the magnet and Ubbley Vios. Do not let go of Ubbley Vios while this is happening; Ubbley Vios has a tendency to get scared and run away from you during this process. However, once the magnet is fully off of Ubbley Vios's head, you can then take the piece of paper and the shims of wood off Ubbley Vios's head as well. Congratulations! You have successfully caused Ubbley Vios to escape the Kalyubi Dimension. Give yourself a pat on the back. Whoop de doo.
Recon

As usual, Ubbley Vios was able to avoid detection of any common sense and decided to walk around for a few minutes. Eventually, Ubbley Vios stumbled across
The Barrelplock.
. I don't remember what happened next.
Recruitment
[
]
Ubbley Vios asked Terminus M for help on homework. "Terminus M, would you please help me with my homework?"
Terminus M declined, saying "No."
Ubbley Vios was thus very mad. This homework was extremely important because it was assigned by the world-famous Idea Breakers and they said that anyone who completed the homework would get a 30-day money-back guarantee if any idea was accidentally broken incorrectly. How could Ubbley Vios possibly complete the homework if Terminus M didn't provide any help? Oh no!
"Terminus M, please help me with my homework! It is extremely important because it was assigned by the world-famous Idea Breakers and they said that anyone who completed the homework would get a 30-day money-back guarantee if any idea was accidentally broken incorrectly."
"No, Ubbley Vios; I will not help you with your homework."
"Please, Terminus M, I really need it. Would you help me on my homework if I give you 500 elephants?"
"No, Ubbley Vios. I will not help you with your homework, even if you give me 500 elephants."
"Ugh! Terminus M, this is so frustrating! I am so mad at you! You must help me with my homework. What if I give you 501 elephants?"
"No, Ubbley Vios, I will not help you with your homework, even if you give me 501 elephants as opposed to 500."
Ubbley Vios was extremely mad at Terminus M. Ubbley Vios was so mad at Terminus M that Ubbley Vios filed a complaint to the world-famous Idea Breakers.
"World-famous Idea Breakers, I need your help! Terminus M is not going to help me with my homework! I even offered 500 and 501 elephants, but Terminus M still refused!"
The world-famous Idea Breakers were not impressed by Ubbley Vios's statement. "Ubbley Vios, Terminus M is not required to assist you with homework. We are unsure of what your request is."
Ubbley Vios was furious. "How do I get Terminus M to help me with my homework?"
"Why would we tell you? If you complete your homework, we will lose money."
"Fine!"
Ubbley Vios walked affectionately up to Terminus M. "Terminus M; you will help me with my homework right now. I am forcing you to. I must complete this homework and win a 30-day money-back guarantee."
Terminus M was not having any of it. "No, Ubbley Vios, I will not help you with homework, no matter how many times you ask."
"Yes, you will."
"No, I won't."
Ubbley Vios decided to win Terminus M over by force. Ubbley Vios grabbed Terminus M and threatened to physically abuse Terminus M. "Help me with homework right this second, Terminus M, or you will face the consequences, you worthless outcast."
Terminus M finally gave in. "Fine. Ubbley Vios, I will help you with your stupid homework. Write whatever you want on it. You don't need to get any particular threshold, you just need to complete it. Now leave me alone for once."
Ubbley Vios quickly ran away to write whatever nonsense on the homework that Ubbley Vios could think of and then submitted it to the world-famous Idea Breakers. The world-famous Idea Breakers then gave Ubbley Vios a 30-day money-back guarantee.
Ubbley Vios was not satisfied. Ubbley Vios then asked The Constant and the Democratic People's Cosmic of Republic for assistance with life. "The Constant and the Democratic People's Cosmic of Republic, could you please assist me with life?"
They both declined the offer. "No."
However, instead of berating them again, Ubbley Vios simply accepted the denial and moved on. Wow, that's such meaningful character development.
The First Wave
[
]
One day, Ubbley Vios felt especially malicious. Ubbley Vios had just finished watching an episode of Complex Corn Redux and got inspired by it. Complex Corn Redux was just... way too good for Ubbley Vios. It immediately changed Ubbley Vios's perspective on everything. Ubbley Vios gained a much more logically cynical mindset and learned that existence wasn't good enough as Ubbley Vios thought it was. Ubbley Vios looked at the clock to warp to gym class. Then, Ubbley Vios took the gym and ate it. This obviously caused Ubbley Vios to become strong and powerful and everything because Ubbley Vios is too cool. Let's call these two incidents the Corn Incident and the Gym Incident respectively. Anyway, Ubbley Vios immediately used the motivation from the Corn Incident and the power from the Gym Incident to take over the entire universe. Victory for Ubbley Vios.
Beings such as the
Hexagon Shut-Upper
began to investigate Ubbley Vios out of pure and utter curiosity and determination.
The Second Wave
[
]
(Image of Ubbley Vios appears on screen)
Ubbley Vios is one of the most infamous entities of all time.
Having dealt significant damage to the Omniverse, Ubbley Vios's actions have caused significant impacts that can still be felt today.
But it wasn't always this way. Ubbley Vios had to work Ubbley Vios's way up the ladder of strength.
The full story is far too much to cover here, so today we will be looking at only a small fraction of what happened. This is the story, of the second wave of Ubbley Vios.
(snare drum plays while the image disappears)
(titlecard that says "UBBLEY VIOS: The Second Wave" appears while LEMMiNO - Cipher plays in the background)
The year is 1931. Ubbley Vios had just finished watching an episode of Complex Corn Redux and eating the gym, and was ready to use Ubbley Vios's newfound strength and knowledge to cause destruction once and for all. Ubbley Vios's first target was the
Folding Ideas
, a verse located near the gym that Ubbley Vios ate.
(show an image of the
Folding Ideas
on screen, slowly zooming in, and simulate Ubbley Vios immediately destroying it)
Ubbley Vios immediately destroyed it, bringing terror to all of its residents. Ubbley Vios was certain that this must have been a success; now Ubbley Vios would be unstoppable... right?
(Titlecard that says "The Mistake" as Kevin MacLeod - Adventure Meme plays)
One of the guardians of the
Folding Ideas
, known as Terminus M, was watching the front of the
Folding Ideas
to make sure nothing was going to happen there, when Terminus M noticed Ubbley Vios right there destroying it. Prior to this event, Terminus M had just argued with Ubbley Vios about homework, meaning they recognised each other. Terminus M was not happy with Ubbley Vios's behaviour right now, because it endangered many innocent residents of the
Folding Ideas
. However, before Terminus M could say anything about it, Ubbley Vios escaped very quickly to cause destruction elsewhere. Terminus M logged this incident and published it in the next issue of Terminus Magazine to spread awareness about Ubbley Vios.
Meanwhile, the
Hexagon Shut-Upper
was doing investigative work on Ubbley Vios. As a result, Ubbley Vios decided to make the
Hexagon Shut-Upper
the next target.
(Coconut Mall plays; cut to a pencil animated segment showing Ubbley Vios and the
Hexagon Shut-Upper
)
The
Hexagon Shut-Upper
was prepared for this. In fact, the
Hexagon Shut-Upper
had prepared some traps in its vicinity in order to make it more difficult for Ubbley Vios to reach it and allow the
Hexagon Shut-Upper
to escape in time. Now that Ubbley Vios had come to the
Hexagon Shut-Upper
's location with the goal of killing it, Ubbley Vios was vulnerable to the traps. Ubbley Vios would have to be very careful in order to make it work, and...
(Slam noise plays, followed by a clip of Ubbley Vios almost dodging a trap but not quite, and getting launched very far away because of the trap)
Ubbley Vios did not make it all the way through the traps. The
Hexagon Shut-Upper
was very relieved because of this, and immediately warned other individuals in the vicinity to defend against Ubbley Vios for the future.
Ubbley Vios could not take on the
Hexagon Shut-Upper
alone. Ubbley Vios would have to get outside help. And thanks to the trap, Ubbley Vios was now in a new place to find someone. It wouldn't take long for Ubbley Vios to verbally convince someone to help Ubbley Vios on Ubbley Vios's quest. Ubbley Vios already found one in the dumpster after only interviewing
three
individuals. Ubbley Vios could tell; this individual was going to be a gamechanger. And his name... was Shia LaBeouf.

Ubbley Vios honestly thought it would go like this:
everyone loses the fight
But in actuality, the fight ended up being much more two-sided than Ubbley Vios had hoped for. Logical Pixel, "Iwo Jima" Tim and Shia LaBeouf all came out from the underground they had escaped to previously and used the Sentient Square that Ruins Metaverses (or something)
