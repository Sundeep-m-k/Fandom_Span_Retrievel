Circuits
are machine parts that are part of most machines. They have the device's programming, and without them the machine probably wouldn't work.

Electronic Circuits
[
]
Electronic circuits are the first tier of circuit. They are used in machines that don't need a lot of programming to do the task at hand. One of them costs 5d
ɢ
. They're made from iron and copper wiring.

Advanced circuits are the second tier of circuit. Machines that have them have a medium amount of programming in them, and an advanced circuit costs 1ɢ. They're made from electronic circuits, copper wiring and plastic.

Processing units are the last tier of circuit. They are normally only used in machines that do very complex tasks. A processing unit costs 15dɢ. They're made from electronic circuits, advanced circuits and sulfuric acid.
