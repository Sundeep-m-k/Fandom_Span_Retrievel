βs are tiny worlds where
αs
and
ζs
live. Although they are usually flat, they appear to maintain some characteristics of a planet. Here are the following types:

Hyperbolic
[
]
Hyperbolic βs are strange, and their properties are exaggrated versions of what happens on a hyperbolic surface.  
If you spin too much on a hyperbolic β, then you are sent to a random
Heaa
(with
Dave
on it) where you will get eaten by Dave as punishment.
Triangles are also forbidden here. All triangles will be downgraded into a line segment. This, however, has been exploited by some clever sentient
αs
to crush other
αs
, increasing the production rate of
αs
, which means more food for them.
Round
[
]
Round βs constantly spin around at a rate that an object would go 10
ζs
per second on average. The bigger the β is, the less this matters.
Towers of 1,000,000
αs
have been built that when climbed up, can launch
αs
to other βs or even to other
Σs
!
Flat
[
]
Flat βs have a force limit of 10
ζs
per second here. Any force greater that and the object that is exceeding speed limits will be immoblizilizfor 1 minute.
Red
[
]
When a β is red, a vaccum is in the center that is slowly eating away at the β. It will also suck everything in, until eventually, the β dies out.
This kind of thing is more common is less massive βs.
Green
[
]
When a β is green, it is in energy producing mode. 10% of matter will be converted into energy, then everything will return to normal.
Blue
[
]
When a β is blue, it will launch every object very high into the sky. This can lead to transportation of
αs
to other βs or even to other
Σs
!
Purple
[
]
When a β is purple, that means it is corrupted, It will spin at 570
ζs
per hour and getting compressed by 1
α
per second and it slowly turns into a black hole.
