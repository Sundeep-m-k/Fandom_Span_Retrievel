A portion of the Wall of Text
Wall of Text, true to its name, appears to be a massive wall of text extending for over

ω
{\displaystyle \theta ^{\omega }}
LY. It has a LOT of text, with the creature having to read everything on the Wall of Text if trying to get through. Due to the sheer size of the Wall of Text, no mortal creature has managed to cross the barrier.
The Wall of Text is divided into portions, with the easy-to-read portions coming first and the super-hard-to-read portions coming last. Portions are also rated on a scale of 1 to 10 based on how easy they were to read, with effortless and super fun to read being 0 and boring and impossible to read through being 10.
Significant Portions

The Thegatus Portion
[
]
The Thegatus Portion is a very well-known portion of the Wall of Text due to it being one of the longest portions that isn't infinite. Due to this, many creatures usually don't make it past this portion. The Thegatus Portion is rated 4.2 on the scale. Many other long portions of the Wall of Text are very similar to the Thegatus portion.
The Chetoma Portion
[
]
Chetoma is also very well known due to how it scores very low on the scale but is also very long as well. Many creatures have reported to have had fun reading it even though it was the third longest portion. The Chetoma Portion is rated 4 on the scale, which is very low for such a long page.
The Wall of Text Portion
[
]
This Portion is so well known is because it is the longest portion, technically making it infinite as it is talking about this page and that page is talking about itself, dragging on forever. This Portion is rated 10 on the scale due to how it is infinite. However, creatures have learned a lot about the Wall of Text due to this Portion talking about it.
The Organismverse Portion
[
]
The Organismverse Portion is one of the most infamous portions. It is mainly hated due to it being so similar to Thegatus, and is widely considered the worst knockoff of a long Portion in the entire Wall of Text. It scores 9 points due to how it is a ripoff.
The Core of Everything Portion
[
]
The Core of Everything Portion is known due to how it literally describes the thing on the other side of the Wall of Text, The Core of Everything complex. This portion has been in a lot of debate due to how it could possibly motivate creatures/entities into trying harder to get to the other side since they already know the rewards of successfully going through. So far, Alphasm has not removed this portion. This portion scores a 6 on the scale.
The Hidden Portion is a relatively small portion of the Wall of Text which is not visible. The text on it is an endless repetition of "aphoonn adek" ('I can't edit' in The Pencil Language).
The Cosmicialverse Portion
[
]
The Cosmicialverse Portion is by far the longest portion in the entire Wall of Text. It scores 10 on the scale as it is just incredibly long. This portion has mixed reviews, with a few creatures liking it but the vast majority of them finding the portion extremely difficult to read through, partially also due to its very strange formatting.
