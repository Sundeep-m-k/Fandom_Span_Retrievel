Universal Neighborhood

UNI-1
,
UNI-3
,
UNI-5039
and
Calamity Galaxy
all reside in the Universal Neighborhood, which is the area immediately surrounding our universe. All of the objects in the Universal Neighborhood were initially formed by the Inertio Supernebula, which still has some remnants today. Some also classify the Greater Universal Neighborhood to exist, which contains these objects as well as UNI-55, UNI-205, UNI-8008 and the Geraldson 9-21 system.
Orkis Universal Triad
[
]
The Orkis Universal Triad is a universal triad composed of UNI-20, UNI-78 and UNI-79. It is slightly larger than the size of normal universal triads.
Other Objects
[
]
Calamity Galaxy
: An interuniversal galaxy triple the size of the Milky Way inside the Universal Neighborhood. It is very unstable, and will likely only be able to live another 10 billion years. The direction it's heading to suggests it was ejected from our universe in a catastrophic event.
Geraldson 9-21 system
: A trinary star system which contains the first
purple quettagiant
observed by humans, Geraldson 9-21 C. Among other things, it contains
Akalor
.
Arkonces Superstructure: A superstructure launched from UNI-216 by the Yux species. It is approximately 1AU wide.
Galinacio Supernebula
: A nebula 20 million light-years wide, which may start producing new universes in a few billion years.
Le Grand Fromage
: A collosal block of
cheese
that is continually growing and emitting mysterious signals.

Politics

DID SOMEBODY SAY POLITICS?????
The Local Universal Group is home to a lot of civilisations. These civilizations are majorly peaceful with one another because of the
Local Universal Alliance
, however this does not prevent wars. The most recent war was the Neighboorhood War, between the Humans and the
Tuhis
in 2512. This war was responsible for almost wiping out half of the entire Tuhis population.
