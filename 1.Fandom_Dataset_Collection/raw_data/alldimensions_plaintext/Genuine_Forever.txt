The Genuine Forever
is a number that is beyond all comprehensions can cannot be describes with conceptuality and superconceptuality. This is by far the biggest number we know of. But I expect we will find something even bigger.
is a term referring to something that truly does not end and is >any scriptable (1), non scriptable (0), semi scriptable (0.5) i-scriptable (i), etc. (any value) term to describe an infinity or number in any form, a period of time, basically anything that would refer to something unending by a truly nonscriptable margin (true nonscriptable = not scriptable even to something that could script any value in the aforementioned state of scriptability, as well as all extensions to this pseudoconcept > all other prefix concepts. This number cannot be used with anything ever by the way. This number is also like an entity because it can make a number larger than itself but it causes them to enter a loop and ascend and yes this also includes all your pathetic numbers trying to be bigger than this as well. Even if there is no other bigger number than this it's still constantly getting bigger.
