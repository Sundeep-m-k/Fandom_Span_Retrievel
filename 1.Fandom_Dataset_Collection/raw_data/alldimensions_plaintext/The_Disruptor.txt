Capabilities
[
]
The Disruptor has been seen to have a very wide range of capabilities, from instantaneous warping, spatial manipulation, and space-time ripping.
Instantaneous Travel
[
]
The Disruptor has been seen to teleport into other Realms using
wormholes
of some sort that the Disruptor can manipulate just as freely, sometimes using those wormholes to move the position of entire Realms.
Realm Manipulation
[
]
The Disruptor can also somehow make Realms simply disappear, although each Realm, when located, seems to be exactly where it was before they disappeared.
Existence Rank
Manipulation
[
]
Sometimes, when the Disruptor needs to avoid being terminated by other entities such as Alphasms and the
Seeker
, it will "fold" each Existence Rank in such a way that if you try to follow the Disruptor, you will end up just glitching through every single Existence Rank and end up in
Unexistence
.
Space-Time Ripping
[
]
The Disruptor can also rip space-time, shown when it shredded a
verse
's space-time, causing it to explode. The Disruptor usually does not use this ability, since it can make its location more easy to find, which the Disruptor does not want due to many entities actively trying to terminate it.
Matter Creation and Manipulation
[
]
Other than instant travel and spatial, existence rank, and realm manipulation, the Disruptor can also create and manipulate matter out of nothing. It has the ability to make ANY sort of matter, whether it is
physical matter
, antimatter, negative matter,
repulsive matter
,
dark matter
, or even abstract matter. The Disruptor has used this ability to create extra existence ranks, most of which are not even describable.
Nullification of other Entities' Powers
[
]
The Disruptor can also nullify an entity's powers and abilities, albeit to a certain level. The Disruptor usually does this when another entity threatens the Disruptor and/or is a major threat to it. However, this ability requires a lot of energy to use, and sometimes can completely exhaust the Disruptor, making it easy to catch it. Any entity that is not an Ascendant
Omni-God
can be affected with this ability.
"
Energy" Beams
[
]
The Disruptor can, yes, also shoot massive "energy" beams. The main usage of these beams is to destroy verses. These beams are used very commonly, as it takes little to no energy to create. These so-called "energy beams" aren't actually energy beams, and are instead some abstract matter that can interact with physical matter through still unknown means.
Advanced Mind-Controlling
[
]
In case you were wondering why gods like the already mentioned Alphasms and Dunkey Kong couldn't simply think of the Disruptor to destroy it, its because it also has the ability to control other entities' minds, making gods that are stronger than it fail to destroy it. This mind manipulation is not unlimited though.
Weaknesses
[
]
The Disruptor, even though it is almost as powerful as something like an Alphasm, still has a handful of limitations that prevent it from destroying every single Realm or wiping out every other cosmic entity.
Limited Realm Access And Manipulation
[
]
The Disruptor, when pushed to its limits, has been seen to not be able to pass the Ωth Realm, and can't manipulate any Realm higher than the θth
Realm. This has allowed gods like Alphasm to on occasion restrain the Disruptor's abilities and keep it in
a secure place
for a short amount of time.
One Life
[
]
Unlike most other entities at the Disruptor's level, it is not able to regenerate after it is dead, thus making the task of killing the Disruptor a top priority. However, due to the sheer number of abilities that it has, killing the Disruptor is very hard, and might even be considered impossible.
Relationships with Other Entities
[
]
The Disruptor, since it is a very deadly entity that can possibly wipe out the majority of the Realms, causing countless casualties and chaos, is hated by hundreds of cosmic entities, some which haven't even seen it before. However, a few cosmic entities, such as the now gone
Chaos
, the
Hyper Nightmare
, the
Destroyer
, and
Delimangur
are not enemies with the Disruptor, and instead share a common goal: to cause chaos.
Local Alphasm
[
]
The Disruptor and our Alphasm and not on good terms, and the latter is actively trying to terminate the Disruptor with whatever he can do. The Disruptor is always trying to escape from this specific Alphasm, and sometimes have even gotten into battles across the Realms, causing googolplexians upon googolplexians of
16th-class
verses and massive portions of Realms to be destroyed.
The Seeker
[
]
Just like our local Alphasm, the Seeker also wants to terminate the Disruptor and lock it in nowhere for absolute eternity. Unlike our Alphasm though, the Seeker cannot really be fought by the Disruptor, since its home is outside of the Realms. The Disruptor just wants to escape from the Seeker, although it's not very possible.
Chaos
[
]
Chaos
, before it was destroyed, worked together with the Disruptor to cause havoc and chaos. When Chaos was gone, the Disruptor came to all the gods who worked together to destroy Chaos and obliterated almost all of them. The ones who survived (such as
Gerald
, the Seeker,
Nacker
,
Bongus
and the
Transcendents
) escaped from the Disruptor, and are now trying to destroy it once and for all.
The
Cosmological Recycler
[
]
A random Cosmological Recycler is also enemies with the Disruptor, but also hates the Seeker as well. This has made collaboration between the two entities very hard, and sometimes have even gotten this CR and the Seeker into a fight before, making the CR glitch into
nowhere
. The Disruptor will usually use this to its advantage, avoiding both entities while they are in a fight and escaping.
