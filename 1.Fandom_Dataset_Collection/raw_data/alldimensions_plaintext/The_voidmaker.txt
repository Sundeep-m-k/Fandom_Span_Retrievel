The
voidmaker
is an extremely powerful entity who actively searches for places with nothing, not even voids; these places are black holes. He replaces any black hole he finds with voids. They have a small chance to be replaced by a

He is not the only voidmaker. There is a single voidmaker in every
Ultimate Continuum
. They are all exactly the same, and this page is a page for all of them. 0.00004% of them have somehow died despite their immortality(?) and the continuums that they died in got quickly overtaken and destroyed by black holes, and some other voidmakers had to fight against huge black hole amount boosts that were portions of that class 10 terminator. Some usually die, meaning that this is probabally how they die, though it is unknown how one died to start each one of these. This usually causes a “viral” black hole that destroys many ultimute continuums. so much that, rarely, an entire name not found gets destroyed.
Hunger
[
]
The voidmaker sometimes replaces verses with voids too, usually if those verses have the majority of them forget to worship him, because if no verses worship him, he goes hungry and has to eat the verse, and then creates a void in its spot. If anybody is sleeping in that verse when this happens, they will get a voidmare.
Voidmares
[
]
A voidmare is a nightmare that usually involves the voidmaker (in the form of a huge black shark, sometimes red with bloody teeth) approaching on the shore of a beach that the person lives on in the dream. As the huge black shark gets closer, a few boats sink for now reason and a few umbrellas become evil and attack people (some versions of the dream have the umbrellas and the people they attack dissentigrate except for the human skeletons, which fall on the ground).
Then it starts thunderstorming (some variants have tornadoes and/or hail). The endless forest (jungle in some variations) that is along the lines of the back of the endless beach usually becomes a huge wall of spikes (sometimes meat grinders, legos, and spiky eggs that roll) and chases the victim into the water.
In the water, a strange weed (sometimes a mini-
devourer
plant) pulls on their foot and drags them down. However, they don’t drown for some reason, and instead get sniffed by usually either eels or sharks. Afterwards, the eels/sharks get devoured by the huge black shark, along with the victim, who then dies.

However, unlike a normal dream, if you die in a voidmare, you don’t wake up (because you get eaten and killed by the real life voidmaker at the same time you get eaten by the big black shark in the dream). If the verse is slacking on worshipping him but he isn’t hungry yet, he gives voidmares to lots of the residents of the verse that end with them waking up right before the big black shark eats them.
Escaping a voidmare
[
]
It is possible to escape a voidmare. If you become aware that they are dreaming and are aware that it is a voidmare, you can start running to the left along the endless beach before it starts thunderstorming. If you travel 2 miles to the left (to the right will result in you hitting the wall and won’t work) by the time the forest turns into the wall of spikes (if this is done after the thunderstorm starts, it won’t work because of the same type of wall that is on the right, which will drain your power infinitely if you try to break through)
Then, the black shark will die and then you will wake up you will wake up in the void that is in place of the verse that was eaten. However, because the black shark IS the voidmaker, doing this causes immense pain to the voidmaker, and the most likely candidate for how the viral black hole starts is if the voidmaker dies if too many people in the verse he is destroying do this.
You can also do this when he is giving you the “warning”, where you will wake up normally and he will get less hurt than if you do it with the death voidmare. About 0.000000001% of voidmares have somebody realize the truth, and about 0.04% of those manage to succeed the escape. Most people who do this die swiftly after that because of the nothingness around them, causing them to freeze to death, or if they don’t freeze somehow, eventually starve. A few really lucky people survived and found a new verse to live in, though. Oh, and I don’t know why 75% of this article is just about voidmares.
