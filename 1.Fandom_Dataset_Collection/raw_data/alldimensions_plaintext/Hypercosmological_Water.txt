Cetaverse
(Dropverses contain ~1,000,000,000,000,000 of them on average) though certain dropverses have the white colour, they are known as "White dropverses" they are made of another material named Kalabelgoof. The Boxes float inside of it causing to remove some particles in it. Notice just some boxes because not all the boxes float inside dropverses, Ours contained by The Boxes observed inside of a dropverse are candidates for disappearing. Life inside them will dye because by the time, the temperature will decrease onto -ε₀°C and it will be transformed to a jelly substance and consumes the boxes by time, approximately 100OYC or ~50 OYC, the sphere dropverses are the most common shape and the normal in our earth if a gravitational attractor thing in the box cluster we can say okay, because it will be shaped like a normal drop of water.
