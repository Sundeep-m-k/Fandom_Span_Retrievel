The
tiny egg
is a tiny egg that is stuck to the bottom of
The small egg
. This egg has no eggshell, as it is a hard boiled egg.
The Material
[
]
While this egg is hard boiled, the material inside is actually a solidified white dwarf that has expanded. This means The tiny egg is still a cosmological verse. In the places where there are gaps between the material, there is egg white. There isn't much egg white since there aren't many gaps.
Why it is stuck to
The small egg
[
]
The tiny egg's inside is still very hot, even though it is a solid. Due to the pressure of the water in
The small egg
, the solid star has put heat force on the bottom of The tiny egg, causing it to melt a little bit. However, since The tiny egg is very light, the bottom solidified, but it solidified inside
The small egg
, so now it is stuck.
