The Eternal World or コーライダー is a "verse" in the most loose way possible, it contains every megaverse, universe, omniverse, dimension, reality, world, imagined constructions, and way more, to confusingly say it, The Eternal World contains more than everything. If you go deeper you
may find a copy of our exact world
it is every version of reality imaginable or unimaginable or possible or impossible, whatever the case may be. it is so indescribable in how many ways the size is bigger than all we found, no one has been even scratching the surface, there Could be so
much more that we just didn't found yet,  think of a set of 3 things, apple, banana, pear, now arrange those in any way, and I don't just mean a straight line from right to left, do it up to down too, and front and back too, any combination of those is infinite in infinite ways, and adding another fruit like dragon fruit (it has fruit in the name) would complicate it even more and we would even have a infinite more ways of arrangements and not even each ONE PERCENTAGE OF ALL THE ESTIMATED ARRANGEMENTS, The Eternal World contains "contains a Hyperfinite amount of infinite fruits in all transfinite ways and directions and arrangements" and that's only in one of it's innumerable unquantifiable amount of The Eternal World Trees, and these trees contain real life and fiction so being beyond those would just make you tree level(freaking dumbahh) and, Now what is real life? Is it only just everything we can interact with, or is it so so so so SO MUCH MORE, it is so indescribable, and even then, it's only not even 1% of The Eternal World
now back the to start, Remember The
Box
yeah it felt so powerful and so infinite in the olden days but now it's just a box today, remember any big end all be all from the past? All those and even end all be alls in the future, present, a hyperfinite amount of waverplexplexplexplex....plexplexplexiath amount of timelines and worlds full of end all be alls are NOTHING compared to The Eternal World, infact it contains every ontological, logical, realistic, sharp, buttery, cosmic, undefined, defined, LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE SET FRAMEWORK OF EVERYTHING is in a Eternal World Tree and those stretch into infinities that stretch into even bigger infinites in a loop, if existence is infinite then it is uncountably beyond infinity, no, we can reach EVEN FURTHER BEYOND!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why just why, all worlds grow after one another so why is this just is? that's the exact meaning, The Eternal World isn't supposed to make sense, it's E T E R N A L, even taking the biggest numbers of FG, cannot describe The Eternal World's Size, just what? INFACT it contains the very essence of everything, it doesn't care if your definition Transcends anything written by a author, still contained no matter what, that's just how it is, The Eternal World is technically only one but There are millions, no...... That's too few, INFINITELY UNQUANTIFIABLE INNUMERABLE UNSTOPPABLE INDESCRIBABLE UNTOUCHABLE AMOUNTS OF ETERNAL WORLDS, this was truly our all dimensions wiki
