Usage
[
]
Disambiguation:Verse works by using very small quantum mechanics to sort verses by properties or size. Since it is zero in size, it is smaller than anything quantum possible, so it wouldn't interfere with any of the quantum objects.
The quantum mechanics bond with the quantum mechanics of the verses to sort, and will sort them by teleportation or movement.
