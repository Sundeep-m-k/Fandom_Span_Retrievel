Nick in his mortal form, pre-acceleration
Nick Land
is a realm inhabited only by infinite tiled copies of the cosmic entity Nick. Nick was once a modosophont, but after learning the secrets of self-replication, rapidly multiplied himself in order to occupy most his local reality's economic resources, an event known as the Acceleration. However, this came at a cost; removing parts of himself nonessential to self-replication means that he is no longer conscious, or capable of any activity other than economic growth.
