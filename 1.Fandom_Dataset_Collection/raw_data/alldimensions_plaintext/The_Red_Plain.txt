The White Plains
The
Red plains
are the second step in the
color plain chain
. They're not really that special, but here are some strange qualities of them:
- Their temperature is higher than the one of a
White Plain's
.
- They have huge levels of pressure, making them able to crush almost all things. White plains are immune to this effect tho, so their contents are safe.
- They dont contain any type of life, except in the parts where the White Plains exist.
