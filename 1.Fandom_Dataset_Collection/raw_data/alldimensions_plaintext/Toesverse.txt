A
Toesverse
usually consists of 10 toes, separated into 2 separate parts called "feet". Sometimes one of the feet will have more than 5 toes and sometimes less than it due to strange things which happened when their respective Toesverse was created.
Toesverses will grow bigger on a periodic basis and decompose after roughly 80 ~ 90 years, making them one of the most short-lived verses ever recorded.
Toesverses are relatively vulnerable, and can be severely damaged if ramming into another verse or accidentally touching a sharp object.
Toesverses are usually part of larger entities which control them, but it usually isnt a full control over them. However, these entities have much more control over a
Fingersverse
. These large entities also usually cover up their Toesverses with things called
Shoesverses
, which help protect the Toesverses from outside threats.
Toesverses, just like a Fingersverse, have
Nailsverses
on each of their toes.
