Omnicosmology is a word used for describing unimaginable objects going up to this concept of level. The term ¨Omni¨ is used to describe a word in the
All dimensions Wiki
, To the actual point of being above
Metacosmology
,
Hypercosmology
, and
Xenocosmology
. Directly being approved to have more matter in those concepts, it is known to be the one cosmology that has faith in them that will be provided to start over again, and again, and expanding its own existence apart of cosmological terms of beyondance. It is the level of itself to given information on a article about its state of existence. There is possibly no way to describe this as below other verses ¨Cosmology¨ and not for other objects beyond the Omniverse. It is simply used as a expansion point to lake here and there to nowhere that you can find outside of it.
This is the last ¨Verse¨ of cosmology. Any other cosmological term beyond this is rather not canon, or is a structure that is stated to be beyond the verses there are, and is not a verse. So what are the leaks provided within this? Well, there is a Hierarchy about Omni-Classes, and 0 being above all of classes. There is a secret one that can be above 0 in terms of dimensionality.
