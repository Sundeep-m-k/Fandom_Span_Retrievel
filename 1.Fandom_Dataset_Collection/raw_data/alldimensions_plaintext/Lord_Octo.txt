Lord Octo
[
]
Lord octo, is a large cosmic entity that is also a god, hes ruling over
Octoverse
and is a very good god at doing his job, he's known for being believed by many of his followers, and is very smart, he might look like a normal basic octopus, but hes larger than he's looks, believe me.
Powers
[
]
He can create and destroy everything he wants, he can teleport and kill everything he wants, and he can destroy the entire verse if he wants every second, hes also known for being a grateful god and using his powers wisely, thats also makes sense because if you didnt know, octopuses are one of the smartest animals.
Knowledge
[
]
We said he is very smart, but how much? he is very smart, he knows every bible and he is yahweh friend, (judaisms believe in him) but his knowledge is very big, he can teleport everywhere
WITHOUT
using any of his powers, just math, same with telekenisis, but he can do it still with his powers, scientist believe he's IQ is 943 IQ, the world record is only 250, imagine how smart he is.
