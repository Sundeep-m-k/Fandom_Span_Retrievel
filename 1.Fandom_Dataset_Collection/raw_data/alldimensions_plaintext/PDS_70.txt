PDS 70 (Exoplanet)
[
]
PDS 70 is a super massive exoplanet bigger than Jupiter and it takes 227.5 years to orbit the sun. If you look hard enough, you can see a little planet in the middle and a bright light to the Right of the planet. You can also make out a ring of fire surrounding the planet. This planet looks like it has a pair of rings with the planet from what I have seen while looking at the photo of the planet
History
[
]
All of its history is not known but if Nasa took a guess, it probably formed from cosmic gasses and asteroids and gasses getting caught with it thus forming the ring of fire that surrounds it. The planet is 370 light years away and is 5.4 million years old.

the star was found in the constellation Centaurus and got its photo taken and it came out like this a ring of fire containing a supermassive inside it This planet can be observed with a ring of fire and in the middle can be a planet and if you can look you can see a bright light. Just note that this planet may not be a candidate for life so be weary that there may be no life except for small bacteria on the surface of the planet
Where it can be found

it can be found in the night sky constellation Centaurus if you find it cool. Authors note I'm realizing after 4 hours went by this looks like a massive eye I never knew it looked liked that before that's nothing you see in space these days. If you could use a better telescope to get a better photo you could possibly see land and see what the bright light is to the right of the planet in the center.
