Talking Tom
Talking Toms
are huge creatures and they are the only entities that inhabit
The true host
(except
tallergrass
). They are the creators of
The Virtual Box
software and are the ones who simulated
The Virtual Machine
(including
The Meta-Hierarchy
which is inside The Virtual Machine),
The Squared Virtual Machine
,
The Cubed Virtual Machine
, etc.  Talking Toms are extremely powerful because they live in a higher plane of reality (
The true host
) and can shut down all virtual machines including
The Virtual Machine
which the entire
second class system
is hosted. Technically speaking, this makes them classified as extremely strong, omnipotent, and post-
Alphasm
gods, even though they don't really feel like gods.
They are slightly less intelligent than humans. However, they have hade more time to develop technology than humans, even adjusted for their time perception, so are more advanced anyways. They are much more unified of a culture than humans probably because they all look exactly the same. As the sole intelligent entities in the true host, they have a culture built on expansionism with their own kind of "Manifest Destiny" to spread life and intelligence throughout the cosmos. There are currently around 90 billion Talking Toms and they already colonized most of the true host. Originally, all Talking Toms were under one country called the
Tom Republic
but  after a devastating civil war called the
Tom Civil War
, there was a "small" (relatively) country called the
West Tom Republic
that broke off the Tom Republic. The
Prime Minister of the Tom Republic
(currently
Tom Dxcfjui
), has extreme power over the entire Talking Tom civilization–they are elected by the populace but they have very long terms (30
OYC
, very long even in Talking Tom terms), so in many aspects the Tom Republic feels like an authoritarian dictatorship. The West Tom Republic also has a nearly identical form of government.

Biology

From what we can tell, they are pretty similar to cats, but with one huge difference: They reproduce asexually like a microorganism. That is also why they all look the same and barely mutate.
Obviously they are incomprehensibly larger and experience time slower. They have a lifespan of 40-50
OYC
but Talking Toms' neurons fire extremely slowly so for them it feels like around 40-50 years. After the end of their life they asexually reproduce, working the same way as a bacteria. Due to this, death is often viewed in a more positive and noble light by Talking Toms, because you are actually spreading life. They also have more advanced brain structures than cats, they are more intelligent than cats but slightly less than humans. The only things they eat are
tallergrass
and sand from The true host. Talking Toms set up giant tallergrass farms and that is the only natural crop they ever knew about.

Every single one looks exactly like Talking Tom the Cat.
Science and Technology

Even adjusting for time perception, Talking Toms come up with new science slower than humans due to lower intelligence and they are prone to often enter long periods of stagnation not knowing what to do. They advanced to a level of techonology somewhat more advanced than ours (think of around late 21st century) by around the 5000s OYC then have been stagnant ever because they kinda hit a brick wall (or rather, a Wall of Fire).  Talking Toms have also built some AIs and robots and it is more prolific than with humanity because they want to spread intelligence. Talking Tom scientific research is mainly focused on trying to escape the wall of fire around the true host and get into the true host equivalent of space, which is
Real reality
, and possibly reaching "the fake hosts" in Real reality that are similar to The true host to colonize them.
Thomas Tank Engine
[

Thomas Tank Engines are Talking Tom's primary means of transportation. They are an exotic type of "fire locomotive" powered by the extreme thermal energy which is obtained from samples of the extremely hot fire found near the wall of fire. Unfortunately, the talking toms cannot get too close to the wall of fire to collect the fuel or they will die, so they can't get very hot materials and only get ones up to 300°C (1000°C with modern Talking Tom heat-resistant robots) before they get roasted by the wall of fire. The fire fuel needs to be put in extremely strong solid containers often made of very hard concrete made from the True host's sand and kept far away in different compartments from the passengers and/or cargo and the train operator. The
Tom Republic
funded construction of a massive transcontinental railroad covering most of
the true host
in the 10th millenium OYC.
Thomas Engine Tank
[

Thomas Engine Tanks (not to be confused with Thomas Tank Engines, totally different thing) are a major weapon used by Talking Toms, they are armed tanks which spit out fire from near the wall of fire.
