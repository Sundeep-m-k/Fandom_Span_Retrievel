Omnatoms
are structures which are assigned to a certain omnelement based on their properties. For example, two Omnatoms designated Primium have very similar properties, although are not 100% the same. There are an indescribably infinite amount of omnelements, but a certain few are very abundant in larger structures. Below is a list of omnelements which hold lots of significance in post-alphasmic verses.

Omnatoms can actually merge together like normal atoms to form
Omegoids

Omegoids
are like post-alphasmic molecules, and there are infinite of them, even "more" infinite than the amount of Omnatoms.
