Macrotime and Macroreality
An incredibly large structure inspired by Obice Novissimo, this place is a living entity of triangles. The whole purpose of this odd lifeform is to become the largest verse, although it has stopped here. Occasionally, you hear it bellow to other Maior Ultima Obices. The size gap between this and Macrotime and Macroreality is like that of Macrotime and Macroreality to Hevv.
This verse-like organism does not require anything but company to keep its mind running, and it does so by interacting with the other Maior Obices within its containing entity. Many have been seen to have unique personalities, and they even launch psionic attacks on one another, decimating their inhabitants.
