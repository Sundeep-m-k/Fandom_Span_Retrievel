ARZ-05 is the largest known ideatic complex that could qualify for classification as a
Black Box
. Not much information about ARZ-05 is known, due to it's extremely powerful infohazardous conceptual shielding from knowledge sources. ARZ-05 dominates all known ideas and physical objects below
The Supremum of Zero
. Besides that fact, it is unknown what exactly ARZ-05 is. Specifically, the mechanism of it's internal concepts remain unknown, as it's infohazardous concepts dominate all known analytic techniques. It is currently believed that ARZ-05 is stable and unmoving. Nevertheless, it will continue to consume anything that discovers its concepts, and is easily able to wipe out the infohazardous defenses of other Black Boxes before consuming them.
ARZ-05 appears to be growing at a rapid rate. Measurements taken in 8651 and 8652 indicate a size difference by a factor far larger than M (where M is the limit of Berkeley cardinals). Due to the sheer size of ARZ-05, almost nothing is known about it. In particular, the lower bounds of it's size rely on superintelligent AI-generated calculations. It is unknown: If it is contained by an object, it's exact EUSI, and any other specific attributes.
ARZ-05 remains the main research subject of our organization.
