About
[
]
The
Dropoverse
is a very large type or
verse
that is usually formed into many, many layers, with
Dropoffs
at their center. Because of this, the Dropoverses do not really have a single 'edge'. It has also been debated if a Dropoverse is a
chain
or a single verse, but for the purposes of this page, we will be considering it to be the latter.
Layers

A Dropoverse's layers usually stay the same size between each other for a very long time, until a study by Danica Todd found that around (this is just an estimate, the exact
number
is not completely known)

layers in on average, there is an extremely large gap in between the next layer, actually increasing in distance over time. Danica said that the number seemed 'oddly
saladlike
' and she also noted that more research should be done to find a reason to why this specific number is so special. It is currently unknown why these layers are where they are.
The color of the layers are different on each layer, until the previously mentioned large gap, where the colors loop. It is possible that the colors loop at most 5 times before this, but we do not have equipment precise enough to know for sure.
