Primordial Hexagons
Noröks are the second most fundamental buliding block, and are made of
Primordial Hexagons
. Noröks define what a simple substance such as rock is made of. The material is decided by the number of points on the Norök. The more points a Norök has, the more Primordial Hexagons it requires, and therefore, the more points on a Norök, the heavier it is. The amount of mass that a point on a Norök has is denoted by 1 Nor, or 188 attograms. Noröks whose Primordial Hexagons are going through rotational vibrations are very attracted to Noröks who are not, and transmit their vibrations by colliding with them. Depending on the postion of their points, a Norök can be in its more common, first isotope, or its rarer second isotope, and its isotope can be changed via certain chemical reactions, although they are different for every simple material.
