The
Pentorb
is, like its name implies, a pentorb (5D sphere) shaped verse that is made up of
Glominders
and has famous 'chiral-spirals' on it, making it a popular tourist attraction for those who can reach it.

Properties
[
]
The Pentorb is a static, visible object that is composed of two main parts: it's 'chiral-spirals' and the actual solid part of The Pentorb that holds everything together. There is also a small hypersphere that encloses The Pentorb, which is somewhat hard to escape. The solid part of The Pentorb has never been broken before, and there is exactly one Pentorb because every Pentorb is completely identical.
Chiral-Spirals
[
]
The purpose of the chiral-spirals of The Pentorb are unknown, although current evidence says that they were actually constructed from some sort of civilization, but if this civilization did exist, there are nearly zero signs of them ever existing. Chiral-spirals are very cold, being very near absolute zero.
