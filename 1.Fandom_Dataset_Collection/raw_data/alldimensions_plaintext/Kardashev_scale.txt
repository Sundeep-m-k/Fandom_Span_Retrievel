The Kardashev Scale
says how much energy is needed to control something. We are type 0.7 on the
Kardashev Scale
. The measure was proposed by Nikolai Kardashev in 1964. The original Kardashev scale divides civilizations into Types 1-3, although extensions used on this wiki are also commonplace.
With using this formula:
K
=
log
10
⁡
P
−
6
10
{\textstyle K = \frac{\log_{10}P - 6} {10}}
, we can calculate our
Kardashev Scale
. The
P
{\textstyle P}
means power, or how many power it uses.
