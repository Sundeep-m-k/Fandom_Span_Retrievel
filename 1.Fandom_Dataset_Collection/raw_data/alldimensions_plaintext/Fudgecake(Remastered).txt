Fudgecakes Experience with The
Horde
[
]
"what do I think of them? Well They remind me of cicadas, they're insignificant but make a lot of noise, they're very hostile, one tried to slice my wings off but my wings are resistant to any kind of damage or what counts as damage, so i easily slapped that one away to a different part of the allsphere and I think I hit way too hard because nihil is telling me that the borders broke, oh dear"

Fudgecake thinks of the horde as like cicadas: insignificant, yet so noisy, Fudgecake had to travel though the Irrepressiblecosm while so many godmode entities (think of the godmode entities as green tadpoles swimming around Fudgecake) and oh yeah, Fudgecake keeps godmode entities as goldfishies in fish tank(u can find in times dimension)
