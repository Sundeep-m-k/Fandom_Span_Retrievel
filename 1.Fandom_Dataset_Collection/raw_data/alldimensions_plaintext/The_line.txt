The line is the largest object in the
The Outer Bubble
. The line is very simple, being composed of a soup of building blocks and other simple particles. It is the easiest thing to take pictures of because of the amount of light it emits. The line is so chaotic that anything that enters it is ripped apart into building blocks.
The line was created when
The Outer Bubble
was still young and very chaotic. As order began to emerge, this region stayed, and got more chaotic. The line still gets more chaotic to this day.
