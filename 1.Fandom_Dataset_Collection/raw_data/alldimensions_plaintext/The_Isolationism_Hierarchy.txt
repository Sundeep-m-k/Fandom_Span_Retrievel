This will be the starting point for many other pages that I plan to make eventually. Think of it as a baseline or organizer.

NOTE

Intro Description

The Isolationism Hierarchy is a hierarchy that is independently separated from a majority of other verses, hierarchies, and other places, hence it being called the Isolationism Hierarchy. Unlike some hierarchies, it starts off at a relatively average size for a human being, with no object ever going into decimal sizes or even negative numbers. However, the size expanse for the largest of the hierarchy extends as far as space-time can witness, even to
The Point of No Return
(although there, you can just go back). For a few verses or realms, they contain a link towards hierarchies, such as the
Official Hierarchy
, with one, for example, being an unofficial starting point.

As said above, this will be the start of other pages to be added to this hierarchy, with possibly new worlds and verses to be added whenever I feel like it.
Being isolated from the Official Hierarchy and most others, the ending applies to this and ONLY this hierarchy, and shouldn't be seen as an end-all-be-all to this entire wiki whatsoever.
Despite having similar names, this hierarchy has no connection whatsoever with
The Isolation
.
