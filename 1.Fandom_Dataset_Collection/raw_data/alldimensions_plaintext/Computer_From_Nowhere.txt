An image of the Computer From Nowhere when first discovered.
The Computer From Nowhere is a very old-looking computer found within
[REDACTED BY ALPHASM]
. Even though it is in
Alphasm's
imagination, the strangest part about it is that Alphasm had no recollection of it until he was notified of it. Because of the possible properties of the Computer From Nowhere, the location of the computer is currently being kept private.

The Computer From Nowhere is a computer that resembles one from the 1980s, but it is somehow much more powerful then a supercomputer. It was discovered in ████
OYC
by an exploratory spaceship, and was just assumed to be in another weird verse.
The Computer From Nowhere is found in an otherwise empty verse. All attempts to remove it from said verse have failed, as there seems to be a second, invisible barrier that the Computer From Nowhere cannot exit (around 50% to the actual barrier). If you find the Computer From Nowhere,
do not attempt to take it
. It may puncture a hole in your spaceship (if you are using one).
The Computer From Nowhere does not seem to require power to operate. It actually is entirely absent of a power cord. The screen defaults to a plaintext format, although it was found that importing
\\windows
into the command line simulates a normal Windows 10 computer. It was soon found after that that the Computer From Nowhere contains many audio and text logs, most of which are more mysterious than anything else.
Computer Data
[

Upon analysis of the computer, it was found that there was an extremely large amount of computer data. A large amount of it will be documented here.
To make this easier to read and access, the information found within the Computer from Nowhere will be split into three parts:
Images and visual media: Self-explanatory.
Logs: A large amount of text data and data logs were found in the Computer from Nowhere, logged here.
Other: Other data found in the computer.
Without further ado, here is our findings of what is in the Computer From Nowhere.
Images and visual media
[
]
33 images unrelated to any text within the Computer From Nowhere have been found. They are only described here as when the Computer From Nowhere has an image taken of it with one of these described images/videos on screen, the computer will bluescreen and turns off for 56 days before showing a barely visible image of a simplified lemon (this can be imaged) which fades and leads to the command line. This is the first image found. All others are found as data within the Computer From Nowhere.

rain.png shows a plain of grass with a floating raincoat. The inside of the raincoat contains millions of water droplets in a vaguely humanoid shape. There are three trees visible in the distance and three moon-like objects in the sky, although there is no star visible in the photo even though it is daytime. The species of grass in the photo has not been identified, although the species of two of the trees are known (
Carya illinoinensis
). The third grows an unknown bright light blue fruit in the shape of a diamond.

A photo of a canvas with a painted blue circle inside. Nothing other than this is photographed, however reading the .png's file as ASCII characters shows the text 'This is my favorite painting' ten times very near the beginning of the file.
