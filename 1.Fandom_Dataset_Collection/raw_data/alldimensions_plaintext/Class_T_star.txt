An artist description of Class T Star
A
Class T star
is a dim type of
brown dwarf
, too small to engage in full hydrogen fusion, but large enough to fuse deuterium instead at 13 - 65 times the mass of Jupiter. Their emissions peak in the infrared, meaning that they should appear a deep red colour, but instead they appear a dark magenta colour. The reason why is because of the sodium and potassium ions in the atmosphere. A typical class T star has a temperature between 550 K and 1300 K.

Class T stars also feature prominent methane spectral lines, which is how they can be identified by astronomers.
