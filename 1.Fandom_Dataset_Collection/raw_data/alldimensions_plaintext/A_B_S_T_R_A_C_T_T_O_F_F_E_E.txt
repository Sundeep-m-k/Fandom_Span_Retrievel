The A B S T R A C T T O F F E E is a small but sentient object located in the
Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse
. It sticks to the outside of the verse, keeping it stable.

What it is made of
[
]
The outside is made of fine coal, while the inside is made of a strange material. The material is called meurjfribfiuewbfiuebf, and it is very reactive. Whenever it collided with another material, it explodes, deleting the whole coal shell.
How the meurjfribfiuewbfiuebf doesn't explode

It turns out, coal is the only substance possible that can repel meurjfribfiuewbfiuebf. The coal repels in and pushes it to the middle, and the coal also protects it from many substances. The only problem is if it gets in contact with a gas, the coal won't be able to protect it. Luckily, the
Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse
does not have any gas, allowing the A B S T R A C T T O F F E E's inside to exist.
Significance to the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse
[
]
The A B S T R A C T T O F F E E's fine coal on the outside of it allows it to stick to the side of the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse. However, it doesn't actually stick to it, it only half-sticks to it. The outside of the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse will get stuck to coal in a way that it is difficult to take it off, but it can still move around on the outside of the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse. The fact that it is tilted to it allows the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse to stay stable, since whenever its gravity moves to one side, the A B S T R A C T T O F F E E will move to the same side and stabilize it due to its high mass and acceleration.
Why it is brown
[
]
It is brown because the light from the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse is absorbed by the A B S T R A C T T O F F E E and it creates the brown colour.
How it was created
[
]
It all started when an unnamed living blob in the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse getting really sick of having to stabilize the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse using advanced and inefficient technology, which is how they stabilized it before A B S T R A C T T O F F E E existed. This one blob decided to dig a huge hole into one of the planets, hoping that they would find materials to make something more useful. It found many weird things, like every planet in the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse has, but one of the things it found was a ball with its own gravity. It was also vibrating when someone held it.
It decided to try to grab it, but due to its extremely high reactivity, the blob got sent flying on touch, and got knocked to another planet. The blob couldn't make it back without more inefficient technology, and it refused to use inefficient technology due to saving it being what it did this for in the first place. The ball was left there for a long time until it finally stopped vibrating, and it released a lot of energy. Another unnamed blob decided to go down and get the ball, but realized it was the reason the other blob got flying. It decided to use coal to create a shell around the ball, and realized coal repelled the ball. It took a long time but the blob was able to completely surround the ball in coal. After that, the ball made a noise, and it was estimated that the noise meant the ball had stopped vibrating. This ball turned out to be the meurjfribfiuewbfiuebf ball in the core of the A B S T R A C T T O F F E E.
The completed A B S T R A C T T O F F E E was eventually moved to other locations, without having much of a use, until the A B S T R A C T T O F F E E missed a planet and got stuck to the outside of the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse. However, then, the Fickvddjdfjsdfjsdverse instantly became stable again, in the middle of a stability project. At that moment, the A B S T R A C T T O F F E E became how it is today, and the first unnamed blob's quest was successful.
