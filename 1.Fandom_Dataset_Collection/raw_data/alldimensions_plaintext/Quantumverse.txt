The Quantumverse is like an average universe, but laws of quantum physics don't just apply to subatomic objects. Rather, they apply their effects to
everything
in this verse.
One side-effect of quantum mechanics being applied everywhere in this verse is quantum tunneling. Quantum tunneling  is a mechanic in quantum physics where a particle has a chance to go through quantum field. While that is very rare in the real world, in the Quantumverse it is used most of the time; it is a way of translating an object from one location to another.
This is just beginning of complete weirdness: quantumverse contains all quantum rules there is, even quantum rules of transinfinite objects and all its components apply to here.
Effect of this is pure chaos with different physics trying to kill each other. Due to explosion in weirdness, let's do some real-world examples. Go and grab.... 100cm nuclear-bomb-fueled paintball cannon, because that's what every house has. Then shoot 100cm paintball with that, aimed at surface of moon. 3...2...1... launch!!!
Shoot few more paintballs at moon, and you will have at least small fraction of region where colors overlap each other. That point is quantumverse, when you change different color regions to different region guided by different quantum rules. Don't make sense yet?? hmm sorry... Idc sadly D:
So with all those quantum rules... quantumverse's actual effective region reaches far out largest infinity.

The Quantum verse has 4-dimensional objects; objects that have an extra spatial dimension. As 4D objects cannot be fully visualized in 3D, various projections are used in order to represent a 4D object in 3D form.An example is the
tesseract
. When rotating and viewed in three dimensions, it appears to be various cubes moving in and out of the tesseract.Weird quantum rules create all sorts of different dimensional objects, but they are insanely rare so don't care  bout em :D
WHITE HOLES
[

Along with 4D items, there are also white holes. White holes are the inverse of a black hole; instead of objects getting sucked into the singularity as in a black hole, objects get sucked out of the singularity. One little special trait of white hole in this verse is that white holes have different forms according to where it is located in which quantum rule region. Sometiems it is in region where multiple quantum rules apply it to it leading to Explode.
