gravastar
is a sub-galactic object created when a star goes supernova. Gravastars are made with a shell made ultrarelativistic plasma. The shell is thinner than an atom and is made up of an unknown type of matter. The inside of a Gravastar is made up of highly compressed energy, making it able to destroy black holes. They are contained in
Gravastar Clusters
Natural Position
[

Gravastars are the building blocks of the Grava-Hierarchy, every verse in it must contain them. Gravastars are formed in clusters, which form into complex structures, eventually making a “cosmic web” of Gravastars. These complex structure are shaped by the presence of invisible dark matter, which explains why
gravaverses
are so stable.
Gravastars do not have to appear in gravaverses—they can appear in
universes
too! This is where the grava-hierachy branches off, and after only 3 “grava-classes,” more than 30 normal classes have past so they can rebranch back.
The Grava-Hierarchy
(

The hierarchy of objects that contain solely
Gravastars
.
Class 1 (Vasik Class)
(

)
This is the first class of The Grava Hierarchy, with verses and structures consisting of just Gravastars.
