Trixa is crazy. it has
Grangrams' number
as many Duoxas, some of them even have SCG(13) Duoxas. Trixas are tunnels of duoxas. It is unknown how the real shape is, the closest theory is that there are many tunnels on a sphere, and tunnels need to be a diameter and thus, all of the tunnels meet at the middle. That middle part is very accurate cause we have put
SVPP
s inside a trixa using
MVFF
s, and it closely coincides with the middle theorem, the sad part about SVPPs is that they cannot grasp the whole shape and as i said earlier, TRIXA IS CRAZY. That middle part is called
The bright zone
because its, well bright. If you go there, you get obliterated by the brightness
