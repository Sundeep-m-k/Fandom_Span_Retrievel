A paradoxical being is any being that has power above existing entities. Paradoxical beings are above
Transcendent Omni-God
s but below the Architects.
Paradoxical beings not only grow in power, but they can transform their shapes and forms. They can distort quantum physics. Interact with any lower-class entity. Teleport, move, bend, organise and destroy existing objects.
No known paradoxical beings have been found due to the lack of technology, but it has been proved that they exist, and there are many of them.
