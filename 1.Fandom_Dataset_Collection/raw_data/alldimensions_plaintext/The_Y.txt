The Y
is a verse which involves the cookie wars and this verse will be destroyed soon. Due to the cookie wars and the semi-related pastry wars, once the Y is destroyed, everything will descend into pure chaos and randomness, and it will be too unstable for anything to form. The Y's destruction is still preventable, and is being halted by the
Obamaverse
, almost all Ultimates,
Dave Packs Co., Ltd
, and many others. The obama field somehow stretches out to the Y, but as soon as the Y is destroyed, the obama field will vanish. If the obama field vanishes, instability will increase rapidly, and all rare materials used by advanced civilizations will also disappear as they are often comprised partly of obamium related shits. If
concept eaters
and anti-concept eaters are destroyed with the Y, then extensions of conceptuality will be destroyed, obliterating all conceptuality and conceptuality-related things. All of these factors and many others will lead to the annihilation of absolutely all once the Y is destroyed, unless
The Biggest EVER
is safe. Unfortunately The X has already been destroyed, and its destruction was catastrophic. No one remembers it though except the Y.
The X
[
]
The X
is a counterpart to the Y, and it is of equal size. It was the exact opposite of the Y, and they were connected and intertwined in harmony until the sraw eikooc began. Sraw eikooc destroyed the X, and its destruction was catastrophic. However that is all we know of it because its destruction removed all record of it. All remaining memory of it is intangible and is only within the Y itself, totally irretrievable without also destroying the Y. Things were much better when the X was around. Sraw eikooc's inevitability alone did not destroy the X, it was instead the unwillingness from entities within to let it end. Sraw eikooc's destruction came with the end of the X, but it has risen again by a new name within the Y.
The Web
[
]
The Web
was the connection between the Y and the X. Now that the X is gone, half of the web has disappeared, which has major effects to the Y and some other things. The Web was built by scallywaggius II, and he was destroyed with half of the web due to himself being connected to it. Now, without the constant maintenance from scallywaggius II, the web is slowly degenerating. The web's degeneration and the inability to make any major change to the rate of its degeneration resulted in the creation of the cookie wars and pastry wars. It poisoned the minds of many entities within the Y, causing an endless constantly escalating conflict that is accelerating the destruction of the web. Once the web's degeneration reaches the Y, it will disappear irreparably. Without the creation of the cookie wars and pastry wars, scallywaggius III would have risen to continue maintaining the web. Due to the infinitesimally small acceleration of its degeneration, however, scallywaggius III will not form as the degeneration will have reached the Y before he can spawn.
