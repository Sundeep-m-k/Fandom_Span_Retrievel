FACTS.
[
]
The naming is not because of god being illiterate this time but because the people in the "Hexegon" have a language different than english so they spell Hexagon like Hexegon.
The hexegon is not being destroyed by
Obice Novissimo
and
In Observatorio
because it self regenerates too fast to be damaged. The outer yellow layer must be completely destroyed for the prime blue part to be damaged in any way.
The people in the Hexegon are called Hexegonians.
The Hexegon is located near the
Poiple Tyangle
so it can only be observed from
The SUS
or the
Poiple Tyangle
.
