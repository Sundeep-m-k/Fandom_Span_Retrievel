Metaweb
is the maximum limit of anything below
Meta
level, because everything above is not the fantasy of people of the first

Limit of reality
[
]
There should always be emptiness after the biggest one. For example: what comes after the
universe
if they were the largest? Emptiness, and emptiness has no limit. So that you don't create more, it can't have space, which means it will be denser outside the concept of mathematics. Due to the fact that the concept of true nothing does not exist. A
Wikiverse
doesn't count because non-fictional objects are an exception. And for one fictional object, another is fictional. It also happens the other way.
Limit of time
[
]
On this concept, time simply does not exist, as does the causal relationship. well, beyond that, you can't exist. It's like being in a time stop outside of all the
gods
in a true non-existence in which the time stop was in the first seconds of its appearance and not existence was eternal. Remember that there is still no space here, which makes the existence of any god impossible because he is somewhere, no matter what anyone says. And density will simply destroy any omnipotence.
Limit of
verses
[
]
There is like the absolute limit of all limits and nothing can be more. I mean, you won't be able to continue the hierarchy even if you do stimulation or
polyasm
. The only conclusion is that it should be contained in a
Pageverse
. And this was contained in a Wikiverse. So the
metaclasses
go beyond all normal classes.
Limit of limits

This is the mind of the
Collective
. It is real and is a bridge between
the meta hierarchy
and this hierarchy.
The fact that it is its imagination means that everything that humanity has invented is contained here. ALL
FICTION
INCLUDED TOO.
