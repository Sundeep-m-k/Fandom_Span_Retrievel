A
Spiroverse
is a
verse
described by most as being very beautiful, and it indeed is, as the ginormous amount of
multiverses
that reside within it attract each other to form magnificent spiral-like structures.
Our
particular multiverse is not in a Spiroverse, instead being in
a
Metaverse
, as most multiverses are. Another notable property of the spiroverse is how every single one is exactly the same to the next. There are no two spiroverses that are different.
Spiroverses cling together to form, you guessed it, spirals! These formations also cling together to form even more spirals, and so on. This continues transfinitely, until it is approximately 1/245th the size of an
Omniverse
.
