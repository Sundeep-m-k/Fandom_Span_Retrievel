The True Box
[
]
The True Box
is the name given for VERY high-level type of
Boxes
with tons of life. This property is common among small
verses
, but are rare
[
2
]
for Box sort of structures. Not really extreme and flashy like the
plutfuseverse
and the
shirroverses
, or rather, the True Boxes are similar to common, smaller
verses
.
Planets, stars, and other common stuff
[
]
Inside a True Box lies
stars
and
planets
and all the other objects making their inside look like that of random verses. Except... they are all different sizes and shapes depending on where you go. And you know what determines size, shape, and pretty much all the other properties of objects?
That's right, physics laws!
Ahem, yes, you may have thought of
matter
and
energy
, but just look around;
electromagnetic and weak nuclear force
runs all your electronics, gravity keeps earth, sun, and all other celestial objects from
falling apart
, and strong nuclear force acts with electromagnetic force to
keep you alive
.
And dark energy

pushes everything away from each other, including your girlfr-

Habitability
[
]
The average temperature
[

]
of a True Box is really warm and pleasant at
20
{\displaystyle 20}
°C~
Γ
0
{\displaystyle \Gamma_{0}}
°C
[
5
]
, which is perfect for life to emerge! And you know what's better? Due to the property of any Box and everything above being able to contain all possibilities and impossibilities, there HAS TO BE advanced life (as in at least
Ultimate Box
level civilizations) somewhere around a True Box, obviously excluding the ones contained in smaller verses.
Even if you include these:
Too high temp variant
: is not a problem because a True Box is too wide for temperatures to spread in less than
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
amount of time
[
6
]
. And new temperature zone keeps forming across them, temperature is completely out of problem list.
Instability of the True Boxes
: is little more concern because True Boxes much more unstable than the normal Boxes and little higher levels. To answer that, imagine filling water bottle with few tens of pellets. Then shake the water bottle by, say, shooting thousands of paintballs at it. Observe the state of pellets, and if they are not destroyed, instability problem is solved. And if they fall apart, you might wanna wear
tinfoil hat
.
High-energy density
: is probably the first big problem. Although a True Box is truly beyond top of infinity, it is still a closed system
[
7
]
. An inside law of them is not allowing energy to disappear fast enough! Accumulating energy can be fatal to life, but luckily, The energy flow is so big that anything below size of
ϕ
(
1
,
0
,
0
,
1
,
1
)
{\displaystyle \phi(1,0,0,1,1)}
[
8
]
just cannot be destroyed completely. This phenomenon also happens at the
Probabilistic The Box Hypercluster
.
Structure collisions
: is probably the biggest problems among all. many structures such as common Boxes are infinite, and when they collide with something and explode, they annihilate everything
[
9
]
around it. And these types of collisions are extremely frequent! There is no way any lifeform can get away with this, and that makes Structure Collisions No.1 threat to lives.
There are STILL plenty of
safespots
for life inside a True Box since there is at least one made by very basic property of things larger than the common Boxes
