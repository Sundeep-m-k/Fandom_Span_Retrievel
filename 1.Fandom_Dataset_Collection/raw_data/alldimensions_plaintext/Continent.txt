A
continent
is any large landmass on a
planet
, usually surrounded by oceans.
On
Earth
, there are 7 recognized continents
(in the English-speaking world)
: North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Oceania (or Australia), and Antarctica.
Continents are the last objects on the hierarchy that aren't necessarily located in outer space.
Technically, the
Kardashev Scale
of a continent would be 0.75, which is around the same scale that
humanity
is currently on.
Formation
[
]
Continents are usually formed through continental drift, that is, a supercontinent breaking up into smaller pieces that later separate themselves.
Supercontinents are formed due to plate tectonics, which overtime cause a planet's crust to be slightly elevated, allowing for the formation of such a landmass. Continents also form from volcano’s, but that is only happening to young planets.
