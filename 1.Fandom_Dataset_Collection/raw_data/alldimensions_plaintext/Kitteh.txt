Kittehs
are cosmic beings who watch over all verses within and below
The Xeno Hierarchy
. However, they almost always watch over the
Jherayon'had
.
Kittehs
are known for their omnipotence, cheerful personality, and most importantly, their ability to get along with pretty much any cosmic entity. Hell, there is even a
Kitteh
called K53-665 who is friends with
[REDACTED]
.
Kittehs
have also been recorded killing entire groups of
Esriums
in less than a minute. However, some
Kitteh
species have poor vision. Most
Kittehs
speak
The Kitteh Language
and Lolcat, but some also speak Spanish, Polish and even conlangs such as Toki Pona and Esperanto.

Box Kitteh
Snek Kitteh
Red Box and Snek Kittehs
Box Kittehs resemble a black domestic cat with blue eyes and mouth and a blue solar eclipse-like glow. They also sit in a box with the same glow and colors as them, which is believed to protect them from threats such as Lynontmeuues and Doggos. Unlike any other discovered (but mostly unknown) Kitteh variant, they have very poor vision, but an unfathomably great sense of smell. Hell, they can even smell a single milligram of water from 1 yottameter away. They are the size of the average domestic cat.
Snek Kittehs look exactly like a Box Kitteh, but they aren't sitting in a box, they are much smaller, and have a very long body. Their body length can range from 3 meters to 1.2 kilometers.
