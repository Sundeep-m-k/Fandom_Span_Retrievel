The JTOHNKVerse is a very large verse. It is ruled by
JTOHNK
. It’s very small compared to the
beemovieverse
. Half of it is the entire Jupiter’s Towers Of Hell game, and on the other half is a giant nk. (Aka the
JTOH
and the
NK
.) It’s so indescribably large that the dimensionlaity, size and kardashev Scale are all JTOHNK. People think that this verse will one day stop and just stay that way, much like
Not yet
. There is 9 rings and 10 zones and 9 systems in this verse. It would take forever to list them all, so I’m not going to.
This is NOT a Ch04s dimension. You probably think it is because humans are constantly changing it, but no. We also know because the chaos level on the
Ch04s Chart
is only 50. A surprisingly low, 50. Unlike the
JTOH
, the
NK
is a very large void. There is no layers because the rings, zones and systems are sky islands. This might become a Ch04s dimension in infinite years but it’s unlikely.
