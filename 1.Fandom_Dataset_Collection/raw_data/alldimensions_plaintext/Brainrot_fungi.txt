Brainrot fungi

Diet
Meat
Brainrot fungi
are symbiotic partners of the
Brainrot parasites
.
They infect any
being
and cause it to reincarnate. Different sizes of brainrot parasite contain different amounts of brainrot fungi, and the smaller the parasite is, the less fungi there is. They can spread by coughing and water contamination.
Unlike other fungi, which reproduce as fast as possible, the fungus likes heat and can eat immune
cells
and dissolve cytokines and antibodies, meaning the fungus can actually fight back against the immune systems of its hosts. The fungus will also try to resurrect the infected if possible, creating vast hordes of zombies.
Right now the brainrot fungus kills
3,667
beings every second.
To give you an idea how big that number is,
Svki.z
is infected by it. But he is an asymptomatic carrier confirmed by a scientific test.
There are also 4 strains of the fungus.
Symptoms
[
]
For most beings, symptoms usually progress quickly, with fever, coughing, seizures, delirium, meningitis, fibrosis of the lungs, encephalitis, kidney failure, anaphylaxis, pericarditis, myocarditis, psychosis, reversible dementia, splenitis, hepatitis, lumbar hyperlordosis, myelitis and necrotic areas of the bowel and heart with death occurring in a mere 2 hours usually because of a cytokine storm. The fungus also weakens the immune defenses so much that mouth , ear and eye bacteria can penetrate the body causing bacterial pneumonia, otitis media, scleritis and possibly vitritis and retinal atrophy.
For
humans
, they will experience mental deterioration, clouded mental functions, and become attracted to bright colors or images and rarely makes them say tralalero tralala, bombardiro crocodilo, skibidi or john pork jumbo josh continuously. These symptoms effect on humans of all ages, however, if the patient is untreated for a long time, they will start to have the same symptoms as animals, and will die with a rotten purple brain that smells of spoiled meat: however If the parasite infects a human in a
Universe
where the laws of physics allow respawning or reincarnation, the patient will respawn, and be healthy and immune but more aggressive than before and will have amnesia and only remember their name.
In rare cases, humans can develop diarrhea, adrenal gland dysfunction, muscle atrophy and dementia and cyanosis, but this has only been recorded in just over 300 people and may simply be an allergic reaction.
There is a small chance of not having any symptoms at all. This is usually because the body's T-cells are naturally immune to the fungus. So it just stays inside them not causing any trouble. Research suggests it may even help them live longer and healthier than ordinary people. They can still pass on the fungus though and have to be quarantined for their whole lives.
Stages
[
]
Like amoeba, the fungus has different stages that help it survive.
Cyst stage
[
]
The cyst stage is the stage shown in the first image of the gallery. They stay in one place and get food with tentacles like an anemone. They are not dangerous in this stage.
Flagellate stage
[
]
The flagellate stage is the stage shown in the second image of the gallery. The flagellate stage is a stage where the fungus behaves like E coli. They swim using a tail. They are also not dangerous in this stage, like the first one.
Trophozoite stage
[
]
The trophozoite stage is the stage shown in the last image of the gallery. This stage is the most dangerous. In this stage, the fungus can eat and do lots of things like invading humans. The fungus is usually found in this stage.
Cure(for humans)
[
]
there is no known cure, the only way to cure the patient is to limit their screen time, however, this isn't a perfect solution. however if the patient respawns or reincarnates, they will be immune to both the fungi and the parasite, but we cannot take their antibodies, due to the fact that the antibodies will weaken in the new host body and would just be dissolved by the parasite into amino acids and proteins. Implanted T cells will simply be attacked by the host immune system and killed(unless the patient is severely immunocompromised, in this case they will last for about 2 days).
War
[
]
There was a war against the fungus by the LUA.
