Elementary unit
[
]
The elementary unit of an Archreality is a unit that serves as the basis for the reality's components.
The most basic elementary objects would be comprised of a unique
combination
of an elementary unit's sub-elements. For example, the lowest level object in Unireality is an arrangement of the properties of a Blueprint Particle, or in other words, a simple list of boolean properties.
By this definition, an Archreality is bound to a
power set
of an arbitrary component.
Properties
[
]
Archrealities with no superior reality will join together at a speed proportional to the corresponding diameter. This event occurs to counter the propagation of gaps which contain undefined information.
A system of elementary units in an Archreality progressively return to their original state, comparable to the laws of entropy in the
Universe
. The magnitude of speed recovery is variable relative to recursive layers, with greater levels of recursion having a higher magnitude, and a inferior depth of iteration resulting in a lower multiplier.
Terminology
[
]
Archrealities with no content other than
Blueprint Particles
are a
Inane
. Archrealities with an elementary unit that isn't an external Archreality are a prime Archreality.
