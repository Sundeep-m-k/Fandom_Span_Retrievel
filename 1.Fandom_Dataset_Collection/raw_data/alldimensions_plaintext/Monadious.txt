Monadious is “something else” a ultimate void without any of subjects and objects. This “void” all grammaric structures including “ever” “there” “is” “could” just not never-occured but all absorbed by it as a always never occurent inexistent potantial of impossibility. However there are no concepts. And absorbing is a concept? What does this mean? Monadious is neither independ or depend or have any relation, they were already neither applicable or inapplicable. It is not a “thing” or “nothing” in Monadious, "absorbing" doesn’t happen. Rather, the possibility that absorption could mean anything is what is un-done. You can’t transcend Monadious because it is a fallacy that never were never-occured and always-occured even as a never-occured potantial. Monadious has no “name” because it requires syntax that always were a never-occured potantial as a inexistent impossibility.
It is home to
one being
, one that rules over the entire Monadious.
Neither time or space or events exists in the Monadious. Neither all “-un/—non-/-post/-pre” transforming of there words. It is not that Monadious is “beyond concepts” it is that “beyond,” “concepts,” and the idea of something being “is” are never permitted to arise.
And arising and the willing concepts always were a never-occured potantial as a inexistent impossibility. Categories and uncategories are just a labeling. Monadious absorbs all applicable and inapplicable concepts and entities. Creation and destruction are verbs and they are forgotten here, No direction no position no coordinates. It is not a void too because it is a concept…
Even (CENSORED) is too much concrete and chained for Monadious.
