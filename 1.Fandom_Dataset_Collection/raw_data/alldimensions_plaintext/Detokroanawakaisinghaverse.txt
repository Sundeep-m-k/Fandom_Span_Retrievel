Reasons why this verse is so hated
[
]
There are a bunch of reasons why the Detokroanawakaisinghaverse is the most hated verse in the Omniverse. The reasons include:
having its dimensionality and size be a salad number
randomly appearing again after it had been destroyed 2 times
being a huge waste of space
Why this verse is called the Detokroanawakaisinghaverse
[
]
The Detokroanawakaisinghaverse was first named by an ancient race of god-like beings way before anyone could remember. "Deto", in the ancient beings' language, means "bad". "Kroana" means "stupid", "waka" means "foolish", and "isingha" means "gargantuan". Due to this, "Detokroanawakaisinghaverse" translates to "bad stupid foolish gargantuanverse".
All occasions in which it has been destroyed
[
]
The first time
[
]
One day,
The Creator
was strolling through the Omniverse when he found something which caught their eye. It was the Detokroanawakaisinghaverse, and they went to check it out. When The Creator stepped inside the Detokroanawakaisinghaverse, they immediately started have a mental breakdown due to just how bad and empty the verse was. Even though The Creator wasn't supposed to destroy things, they did anyways and used their full power to obliterate the Detokroanawakaisinghaverse.
The second time
[
]
1
OYC
after The Creator destroyed the Detokroanawakaisinghaverse, the Detokroanawakaisinghaverse appeared again in a different spot in the Omniverse. This time, it was harder to destroy for some reason. The Creator was very confused, and promptly destroyed the Detokroanawakaisinghaverse again.
The third time
[
]
After 0.13 OYC, the Detokroanawakaisinghaverse appeared once more. The Creator found it very easily, but this time, since they knew about how the Detokroanawakaisinghaverse will always appear after it is destroyed, just pressed it against the side of the Omniverse, flattening it, and they folded it together, making it smaller. The Detokroanawakaisinghaverse still exists, but is noticeably smaller now.
There is an even more hated verse called the Opusquakalupuninlaskoshedbekseuqorueverse.
