The strongest get a vision at infinite chaos insanity when they open something they shouldn't.

Chaos and Insanity
Everything is nothing and nothing is everything, and paradoxes aside, if everything you know is part of a higher world, which is part of an even higher world, and it continues on forever, where does it all start? And the end?

Ultimate Fractalism
The Ultimate Fractalism is a chaotic dimension of fractals and sub-realities. It exists in a weak superset of logic beyond traditional theory, so it doesn't contradict reality by existing.
Structure
[
]
The Ultimate Fractalism isn't a
verse
; it is a web of connected
omums
contained in a border. It has the ability to create larger clones of itself, known as
Penultimate Fractalisms
. However, the Ultimate Fractalism is still bigger than all Penultimate Fractalisms combined; both structures grow at the same rate. This force causes the Allsphere to expand, similarly to dark energy in
our universe
.
