Pearlverse
is a type of verse made of
pearl material
that encompasses the entirety of The aardwolf. it is 70 meters thick and non-reflective. Pearlverses isn't protected from the rays of the aardwolf at all, but instead after absorbing the light energy, Pearlverse immediately transports it to the outside and blasts itself off in a certain direction along with everything inside of it.
Properties

This behavior has actually been observed to stabilize the rotation of Pepton, and has also been proven that without stabilization, Pepton could accidentally hurt itself and its contents would leak out. Pearlverses also eliminate any potential threats to The Wheel / Pepton via immediate obliteration. When Pearlverses destroy something, so much power comes out that the thing that they destroy is destroyed 900 milliseconds before they actually attack it, And if something actually suceeds in peircing a Pearlverse all the way through to The aardwolf it will pop. After the Pearlverse pops everything in the vicinity will also pop including
Blueprint Particles
and it will make the sound "KOK". Because of their protective nature towards their containing bodies, they have been nicknamed Enormus Antibodies.
