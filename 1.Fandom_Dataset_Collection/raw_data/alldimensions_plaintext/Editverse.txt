The
Editverse
is an unique
verse
that gets bigger with every edit done on this wiki, hence its name. It's volume currently is 164,032 m
3
, but when it reaches the same volume as its
Wikiverse
(which is 100% impossible, considering its growth method), it just stops growing, until the Wikiverse gets bigger thanks to the addition of more
Pageverses
.
Ascension
[
]
In rare cases, an Editverse is known to ascend its own Wikiverse and cause chaos by making Primordium Omega in a
Sentient substance
's
multiverse
until they merge with it. There have only been 6 cases of this happening all over the
FANDOMverse
.
