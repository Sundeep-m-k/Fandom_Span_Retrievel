are the most safe triangles and the smallest are non-habitable, this thing is the concept of triangle itself, or to be honest it is the shapes themselves, the things that contains this are non-existence, because the sierpÃ¬nski triangle like I said, he transcends all shapes so every image that have a concept of a shape or close to a shape or donâ€™t have any relation with it but still an image, the SierpÃ­nski triangle surpasses it. It seems to stretch whenever you go, even the

, there is still more triangles, no one know how much this extends. There is more shapes like the circle and the squareâ€¦ to be honest the more the amount of the angles was decreasing, the more bigger it was (in this Xeno hierarchy shapes context). WIP

This is a trap for the Xeno-entities that have tried to escape this, they will be trapped in SierpÃ¬nski prison, the worst place ever, even worse than Dunkey Kongâ€™s hole
