The
Final Existence
is a second area that contains many objects called Final Beams, and also a huge amount of
Final Hyperverses
in the empty spaces between the beams. When these beams intersect, lots of light are emitted due to the varied amount of verses that each beam contains.
Final Beams
[
]
Each Final Beam contains verses of drastically different
laws
, although almost none of them allow photons to escape their barriers, making The Final Existence extremely dark in most places. When these beams collide, the barriers of these verses also hit each other and allow lots of light to escape, although most of these collisions are found near the edge of The Final Existence.
These verses are usually called
Capsules
due to the amount of light that they contain. The reason that Capsules form a filament shape to create Final Beams is because of the way that gravity attracts Capsules to other Capsules, forming a sort of coil shape (like
Versal Strings
).
