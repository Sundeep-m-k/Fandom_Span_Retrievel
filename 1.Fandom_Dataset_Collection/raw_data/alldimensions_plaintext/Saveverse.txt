The Saveverse is a large
Multiverse
. A large "button" resides at the far corner of the Saveverse, and if it isn't pressed within 13 Earth days, the Saveverse and everything in it will be reset back to the state that the Saveverse was in at the last button press (this does not reverse time/memories).
A large civilization exists in the Saveverse. They guard the button extremely well, and will press it
at an interval of exactly 1 press per 5.2624345 hours
. Unfortunately,
this pressing is not done by an automated machine
, and instead by regular creatures.
A large timer is placed above the button
, and when it is time to press the button, a loud alarm will sound, alerting the creatures to press it.
These creatures are paid very highly as they are vital to ensuring that the Saveverse does not reset.
On 6 occasions, the button was pressed too late, causing the Saveverse to reset. On all the occasions, the creatures responsible for pressing the button late were fired and had to live in exile. These events each happened in 132
OYC
, 742 OYC, 745 OYC, 791 OYC, and 1842 OYC.
