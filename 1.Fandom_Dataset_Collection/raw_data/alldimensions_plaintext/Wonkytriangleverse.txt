The triangle of the good day in the big box that likes to dance and go home like a camel with a triangle on its head and he is the same camel species as the one that i saw yesterday so i like to look at the clock to warp to gym class and i have to go home because the chicken in the oven is ready and the chicken is for my brother Ted who has a red jacket and a blue skirt and some green socks and he likes to do taekwando and he has a red belt and he is very good at it and he needs to go to the bathroom so he went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet and the toilet exploded so he had to go to the tree outside but the tree fell down and i want to go swimming in the pool so i got in my car and i turned it on and started the engines and drove to the local swimming pool so i could swim and in the shallow end there was a person in a red shirt and he wanted to get out but there was a storm and it was very bad and the room got a hole in it and i had to leave the pool and i got in my car and went back home and yesterday i won the contest for biggest pancake and i got that reward of the best pancake by taking the good stuff and putting it on a giant pan and that made it big so i took it to the contest and won a green helmet for a motorcycle and i used my motorcycle to go all the way to china and at china i found the great wall of china and it was made out of rock and then i went home to put the chicken in the oven.
