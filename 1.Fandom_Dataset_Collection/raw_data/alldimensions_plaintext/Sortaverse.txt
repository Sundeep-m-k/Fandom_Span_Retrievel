"Incredibly stable, incredibly smooth, and incredibly abundant. The new hottest thing on the market. But don't try to eat it."
Believe it or not, the Sortaverse is not that chaotic a place. It’s not too dense, and as such, it is basically a soup of random
Archverses
, which, when viewed at an extremely large scale, takes a gooey sort of shape. The Sortaverse has a border of course, but it is incredibly fluid, and due to this property, their size can vary immensely. Like, IMMENSELY.
So in the
Tredaverse
page I talked about the
Tredaverse
being doomed to be destroyed. Well, here is the elaboration. The
Sortaverse
is actually a renewable source of matter. See, the Sortaverse contains many portals into other verses and even sucks some matter up from the
Rintaverse
. As well as this, when a Tredaverse explodes, it explodes into a wide host of verses, which start combining up into new verses.
The Sortaverse has plenty of
Metabubbles
, however, since the Sortaverse is so gooey, these Metabubbles are dispered throughout the Sortaverse. This makes some areas more stable than others. As well as this, Sortaverses have numerous sinkholes into the
Kindaverse
, which funnel dark forces out of the Sortaverse.
! WARNING !
Do not try and swim in, or make soup out of, or drink, Sortaverse Matter. It's not a liquid. You'll look like an idiot. You'll also be DEAD.
Sortaverse Matter
[
]
The Sortaverse also has Sortaverse Matter. When something is annihilated or exploded or whatever, it typically ends up in the Sortaverse soup as Sortaverse Matter. Sortaverse Matter tends to draw like
Archverses
together. And, when absorbed into one, it is converted into whatever matter that verse is made of. Sortaverse Matter can expand, alot, and it gives off alot of orange-ish light. This means that the bright spots are either high in
Tredaverses
or high in portals, especially to chaotic dimensions, where most fields, generic matter and loose energy (light, etc.) that leaks into the Sortaverse is converted into this Sortaverse Matter.
While this Sortaverse Matter accounts for only 15-20% of all
mass
in the Sortaverse, it accounts for 94-99% of all matter. It sort of coats the
Archverses
to make them glow orange. The reason why it attracts verses so well while being so light is unknown. It’s less like a large body, more like… glue. Another weird property is this Sortaverse absorbs all light and colorshifts everything to orange light.
Sometimes, objects can be dissolved into Sortaverse Matter, which is yellow, and creates alot of light. However when it is absorbed by an Archverse it converts into whatever matter that Archverse is made of. This Sortaverse Matter is also really good at diffusing the field of a
Tredaverse
. Rogue
Tredaverses
can have their field grow alot bigger because of this. However, on the timescale of a Sortaverse, when a Tredaverse escapes it just dissolves pretty quickly. It is then usually absorbed by a
Rintaverse
.
Size, Density & Tech

There are some reports of smaller objects being sucked into the sinkholes. These were generally unlucky universes. If sinkholes drift, they can start disposing of stuff that isn’t dark forces or chaos. However,
Kindaverses
also feed the Sortaverse with light, so it is a beneficial cycle.
The Sortaverse has no average size. Ours is actually a bit on the small side, only being about 52.2 tresvigintillion
Tredaverses
wide, or
10.82 unoctogintillion LY.
However, they can reach up to
133.1 SEPTENOCTOGINTILLION ly (1.331×10
266
ly),
and the largest one on record, SRT_XLJ2.6159a, was over
82.2 TRESNONAGINTILLION LY.
This comes out to 8.22×10
283
ly!!! This was due to multiple Sortaverses being created next to one another and subsequently merging into a massive and giant Sortaverse.
The Sortaverse is surprisingly not that dense, in fact, it’s about 5 times less dense than a
Tredaverse
. This is because while a Tredaverse may appear to be less dense, it is still incredibly dense due to the sheer amount of
Udekaverses
compressed around its perimeter. As well as this,
Tredaverses
make up only about 30% of matter in the Sortaverse (excluding void and Sortaverse matter).
The Sortaverse is highly sought after for its stabilizing properties. So, civilizations with a Kardashev > 23 can sell Sortaverse Matter to smaller
Archverses
and gain a monopoly on the market. As well as this, numerous civilizations have built portals into Sortaverses from their artificial verse to stabilise it and serve as a replacement for
Metabubbles
.
The Sortaverse has a perfect opposite, the
Kindaverse
. This is where dark forces in the Sortaverse go.
Kindaverse
[

The Kindaverse
The Kindaverse is like the
Sortaverse
, except with numerous differences. First of all, it is full of dark forces, and as such, actually has almost no mass. It also has portals from multiple huge verses and voids, where rogue matter exists. Usually, these portals take this matter in and converts it to energy and dark fields for the Kindaverse. Its density varies alot, and its color in the
Rintaverse
depends on the density. Sometimes, these dark field leach out into the portals to the
Sortaverse
. Normally, these forces are just converted into
Sortaverse
matter. It is this cycle of exchange that constantly ‘purifies’ both the Kindaverse and
Sortaverse
. And it’s for the better too, if the Kindaverse’s energy could leach into the
Sortaverse
nothing would exist, as these would be in perfect equilibrium and everything would just be one soup of matter. It is this reason why dark and light must stay separated.
