Hardcore Zyoron
No, the image is not moving. It is meant to hypnotize your eyes so it looks like it's moving. It does not move for me.

The
Hardcore Zyoron
is the largest
Hardcoreverse
in
Giganta's Class
, and its also the class 20 terminator. They contain unknown particles that might be similar to an
Axion
or a
Mathon
. The verse is illusional, meaning that it is confusing for entities. The Hardcore Zyoron's pressure can compress you into small pieces if you try to leave without any suit. If you look at one of them for too long, your eyes will be hypnotized. But why? Because it’s weird. The zyorons contain lots of weird things.
