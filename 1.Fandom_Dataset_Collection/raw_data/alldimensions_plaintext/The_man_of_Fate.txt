The man of Fate
is a supernatural being who controls everyone’s future. When it is gone however, it can never come back for another 5000 years. And in those 5000 years, the universe won’t exist.
But after those 5000 years, The universe comes back like that. We never process those 5000 years, The man of Fate always leaves sometimes. But we never process it. Because The man of Fate leaves, sometimes the universe changes or distorts a bit. The Mandela effect never existed. That was the universe changing itself. When The man of Fate changes something, it can never change back. If The man of Fate was always leaving, we would cease to exist due to the universe changing too much. Only one thing can be changed in the 5000 years the man of Fate is gone.

He has a daughter named
Neon
, but they rarely meet. When Neon was very young, she made a heart necklace for the man of Fate. He has worn it forever since then. He also has a daughter named
Stella
, and he made a universe for her to reside in, called
Karano
. He wiped Stella's memory of him, for she was easily influenced, so to make sure she doesn't develop M.I.A.M, he made a home for her to reside in with no thoughts other than her own.
