The
Great Superpentagon
(THEGRESUP) is the largest shape-verse before the

. Outside of it laws of physics don't work, because strings in there are totally broken, but permitting the existence of cosmic objects. While physics is broken here,
Macroformers
are perfect for the job.

The pentagon, much like its lower shape cousins, is a type of portal-esque verse, with each pentagon being a door in and out of a pocket of reality with many more
Altahsuperverses
on the inside than out (you may be reading this from a said pocket). The green of the pentagon mostly derives from its density, as green is one of the most dense colors containment-wise, only behind black.
For the pentagon, it is classified as a shape verse and not superverse is because of the person who first saw it, as they were very messy and did not know the zoom of their telescope, so they thought it was after
The Great Square
in the hierarchy of who knows what. It has been replaced into both.
