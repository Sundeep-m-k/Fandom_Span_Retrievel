The
Inferno
is a gigantic ring of gas and leftover husks of
universes
that vary in size. Somehow, said universes are so hot that they are set on fire constantly, thus no (conventional)
life
can survive
here
.

Rotation
[
]
The Inferno rotates very slowly, so slow in fact that it takes 7 trillion years to do a full rotation, nothing significant happens once it makes a full rotation the cycle just continues again and again, until the inferno will run out of stuff to burn and it will become a dead husk rather than a fiery mess and the cycle repeats.
Sproyong formation
[
]
This is one of the only type of universe that can create
Sproyongs
by itself, because they can become super hot for some reason.
Thus, only Sproyongs are able to thrive here, as everything else gets vaporized instantly, really hot or just pure nonexistent as mentioned earlier.
Second ring
[
]
The Inferno has an extra-halo like ring of fire surrounding it, the secondary ring is around 10 septillion light years in length and width. Anything in this radius is incinerated almost instantly because it's really hot, hotter than 300-pulsar cores. If someone or something managed to get past that and into the inferno itself, they will see only orangish circles. These circles are actually just really big fireballs that seem to be left over remains of universes that got really unlucky.
Location
[
]
It was first located in a gigantic
void
that was filled with stuff before the inferno was created and ate the stuff for breakfast or just vaporized them instantly. Eventually, said void met the same fate, thus allowing the Inferno to escape and float around.
