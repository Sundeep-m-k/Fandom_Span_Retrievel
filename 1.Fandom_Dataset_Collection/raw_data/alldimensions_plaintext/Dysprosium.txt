Uses

Dysprosium is used as a metal for renewable energy (also actually real), so quite important for energy creation of a universal civilization. It also has unique warming abilities when outside of a

, so it's also used for air condicioners, yep.

Dysprosium can be fused with other things, which is strange. Its warming abilities mean that, when combined with
Cheese
, it creates Dairyite, which is a cheese alloy that has can block all lazers, independent of their power. Unfortunately, to get the energy from this, it drains the surrounding energy, so everything gets hypercooled.
