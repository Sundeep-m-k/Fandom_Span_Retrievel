The Gigamonarch
The Allsphere Leaves exist as dimensional constructs within a higher-order reality structure. Each leaf represents a complete dimensional space containing all conceivable and inconceivable sets of existence. These leaves originate from
Allsphere Trees
, which populate infinite dimensional regions. Each Allsphere Leaf constitutes a self-contained dimensional space. Within this dimension, all possible sets of reality exist simultaneously. The dimensional boundaries of each leaf encompass both comprehensible and incomprehensible forms of existence. The Leaves are unbounded and are absolutely unlimited.
Gigamonarches
are vast dimensional regions within each leaf. These regions serve as major divisions of the leaf's dimensional space. Each Gigamonarch encompasses enormous areas of reality and contains multiple sub-dimensional zones.
Giftboxes
exist as discrete dimensional pockets within the Gigamonarches. Each Giftbox contains a single concept in its pure dimensional form. These dimensional spaces isolate individual concepts while maintaining their connection to the broader leaf dimension. The Allsphere Trees exist throughout infinite dimensional regions, forming what can be termed the Allsphere Verse. Each tree grows within its own dimensional space while simultaneously connecting to the broader verse structure. The trees produce leaves that contain complete dimensional realities. An infinite number of these dimensional trees populate the verse. Each leaf dimension contains all possible forms of existence. This includes realities that contradict each other and realities beyond comprehension. The verse operates through layered dimensional structures. The Allsphere Verse contains tree dimensions, which produce leaf dimensions, which contain Gigamonarch regions, which house Giftbox spaces.
Allsphere Leaves can estimate to 8 CI or even in The Hundreds or Even Thousands
