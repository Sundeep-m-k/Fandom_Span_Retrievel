Species Info, Ideology, and Flag
[
]
These calm fellows move slowly and look like the stones in
this
and are a hive mind, with a complex system of individuals. An ancient has free will, but shares the same mind with all the other ancients. They are created by putting a special stone into a rock and carving it (if it has no soul, it has no memories, the rocks can carry a soul to an ancient vessel). They are technechally in anarchy, but they stand united as a nation with a completely neutral government. They call this an Ochracy (Not to be confused with an Ochrachie, a group of ancients)
Their flag is a moai facing to the right, signaling progress towards the peracosmos.
