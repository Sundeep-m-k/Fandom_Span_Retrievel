Little Rocks are called this because they are little and commonly made of rock, although they are sometimes made of iron and even mirror in some cases. Little rocks commonly orbit around
Big Rocks
due to their comparatively weak gravitational pull, but enough of them can completely overwhelm one. There are many different Little Rocks, too many to display in base 2 without using enough information to crash your entire networking system, and due to the way that they are created, they very commonly contain Organic, causing many civilizations to exist. Little Rocks are created by peices of matter coagulated together, usually from exploded Big Rocks, and Big Rocks can change the simple material of an object.
Due to wood and Organic being the same weight, when in formation a Little Rock allows those materials to rise up close to the top and just below the plastic layer. The Wood and Organic materials fused together to make wood-based life now known as leafplanks, who take in water from the water layer below to shoot their seeds. In the plastic and plaster layer, there is mostly plastic mixed in with some glass shards from leafplanks who pushed their wood through the glass layer, this can cause an interesting effect where the plastic is translucent, making the large clumps of plaster there much more noticable. Below all of this, there is a rock layer, this layer is the biggest layer, taking up a whole 99.122302% of a Little Rock on average, although it can still take up less or more than this. At the very center, there is a core made of iron and gold, these cores are very valuable and usable and are often harvested, they are fabled to be home to fabled cities of gold, which might not be a hoax, given that material changing reactions do occasionally occur down here and generate Organic.
