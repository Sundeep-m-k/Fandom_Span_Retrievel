This world is just a mirror version of other worlds... Something is opposite from the original but no travelers can figure that out because when they enter, all particles of their body turns into the Δ particle and when all Δ particles' energy is lost they just dissolve leaving nothing behind.
Δ particle is the Dual Mirror Particle. Not to be confused with
Primordium Delta
