The
Upload Site
is a collection of quintillions of
setverses
that work together to upload things onto the
Upload Network
to then be uploaded.
Upload sites are ran on computers that simulate
alphasm
and therefore upload sites are not the end to but close to the end of alphasm’s imagination before it extends past it. It also contains portals in a hub to travel to other realms.
The upload site is a murderer too, it uploads Murder weapon.exe that destroys dead setverses, killing all who live in them. They spit milk.
