Triangularverse
The Triangularverse is a rare, stupidly dangerous parallel reality where everything is made of triangles. Not even metaphorically, literally. The laws of physics, the concepts of time, emotions, and even sandwiches are all triangles.
A list of examples can be shown under here.
Triangular-shaped atoms, weird, sharp, don’t touch them.
Additionally, time flows in 3-pointed cycles. Past, present, future, and sometimes "sharp pointy moment."
Beings known as the
Trikind
, not to be confused with Flatland triangles.
Jagged pyramidal mountains, flat triangular oceans, and the occasional
The Great Floating Dorito
. No one eats it. It eats you.
Why is it so weird?
Because when the laws of reality were being assigned, someone accidentally poured extra geometry into one universe's batch, and rather than fix it, the Cosmic Janitors just marked it as “DO NOT ENTER: POINTY”.
The Great Floating Dorito
Notable Event:
During the chase between
Ribspike
and
Flying Moon
, their combined speed collapsed the Triangularverse into a 2D triangle for 6.2 milliseconds, which is still considered its most peaceful period.
