The
Pixelverse
is a universe that pixelizes everything by 5 milimeters.
It doesn't have life because there is no chemical reaction between pixels, except for forces like gravity and collision. When pixels exit the Pixelverse, they still are pixels, but made of Block matter, which always form cubes of 5 milimeters.
