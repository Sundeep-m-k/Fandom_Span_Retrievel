The
Forgotten God
(
Bood-Zul-Vav
in
Puffish
), is an ancient
entity
created by the
Primordial
and one of
THE 8 DIVINE GODS
. It was sealed away from exiting its realm, as was
BOOD-VOOD-VAV
and the
Devil
.
It was sealed because its goals were to in its own words 'fix everything', which in reality meant to make everything static, unchanging, non-moving and simple, it still has a few creations left that it has created to help achieve this, the only known one right now is
Zul'Em Kauth
.
It is the opposite to
Glitchy
, the 2 would often fight a lot before it was sealed away.
