Heck
is a type of verse with negative dimensions that is too small to be given an accurate measure of size or shape.
It's been theorized that something exists inside them, but Heck is too small to be observed by almost all realities
(outdated). Even if something was able to see something of Heck's size, Heck would still be very difficult to observe because it moves fast enough to create rifts between verses, causing it to change which verse it's in at an extremely fast rate.
Size

The imaginary number used to measure Heck's size is one that would not use the imaginary unit "i" like most imaginary numbers, but use a different imaginary unit that allows the number to be smaller than zero and negative numbers, but still positive. That concept may sound completely impossible to most people that may be reading this, but it's called an imaginary number for a reason, therefore making it possible.
A positive number cannot be greater than itself multiplied by two, therefore making Heck the smallest verse. Hecc has shown that it's '2x property' fluctuates from 0.5x to 2x from time to time, but Heck has properties that counter either case. 2x is countered by the Heck Number (rendering Heck the smallest), while 0.5x is countered by Heck's normal shrinking properties (rendering the position contested). Basically, the position for smallest Verse would either be kept by Heck or eternally contested between Hecc and Heck.
