The Spreadverse is a sentient verse that can convert other nearby verses into mindless minions of it. It does this through a relatively simple procedure. However, the Spreadverse also has life inside of it, most of which are not willing to let the Spreadverse "spread" to other verses.

Structure
[
]
The Spreadverse has a very simple structure, and it is very easy to navigate through it.
The Core
[
]
The Core is the layer at the center of the Spreadverse. It contains a very strange, corruptive material known as Oqium, making the area surrounding it uninhabitable. The Core allows the Spreadverse to spread as well, and houses the "brain" of the Spreadverse.
The Tentacles
[
]
The Tentacles are a layer of black, slimy tentacles that are connected to The Core. These tentacles have been cut before by the life, but can easily grow back and are very hard to destroy.
How the Spreadverse Spreads
[
]
The Spreadverse's tentacles will suck out Oqium from The Core.
The tentacles will travel out of the Spreadverse and latch onto other verses while also injecting Oqium into the verse.
The Oqium will slowly infect the entire verse, at first infecting the outer area of the verse. Once the core or up to 90% of the verse is infected, it will be under control of the Spreadverse.
Due to this, the Spreadverse has successfully enslaved hundreds of verses close to it. It has been locked away in other massive verses countless times, all of which proved unsuccessful. Every time, the Spreadverse used its simple infection method to infect the verse it was kept in, turning it into another minion of it.
As of now, the Spreadverse has stopped its spreading (possibly due to a shortage of Oqium in its core) and is inactive.

LOG.29,182,192,817 AD:
“As any archverse-colonising civilisation knows, Mingaversite (the protective layer of a
Mingaverse
), is not only incredibly strong, it is a perfect insulator, meaning no light, sound, radiation, or even fields can get in, unless they are absolutely, ridiculously, STUPIDLY strong. A project has been planned to cover the entire Spreadverse in a shell of Mingaversite. It is not a verse, so it should succeed, and eventually, the Spreadverse will run out of Oquim by itself.”
LOG.PRESENTDAY, YEAR: UNKNOWN:
“Well, we were successful. And so, the tyranny of the Spreadverse is no more”.
