History
[
]
Originally, the Trappedverse was a relatively big verse in the
Omniverse
. Roughly 349
OYC
after it was formed, it went too close to The Verse Trap and got a huge side of it frozen. Most of the life in it died.
After about 2 minutes, it suddenly came across The Verse Trap again, and was heated to an extreme temperature. The Trappedverse now had a freezing cold side and a burning hot one, and a wall of liquid/solid matter divided the 2 portions.
By now, all life in the Trappedverse had already died due to the extreme temperatures. However, things were about to get even worse. The Trappedverse drifted right into The Verse Trap once again, and this time, it got shredded into approximately 45 pieces. 44 of these pieces came to revolve around the biggest remaining piece of the Trappedverse.
The next 2 "traps" happened in less than 1 second. The Verse Trap made the now unrecognizable Trapverse mess have insane gravity, which almost collapsed it into a black hole, until the Trappedverse got "trapped" again, which made it start rapidly expanding. This made the Trappedverse slightly more dense and broke the 44 smaller Trappedverse pieces into over 523 pieces. The pieces kept breaking for a long time, and it is unknown how many Trappedverse pieces there are now.
Now, the Trappedverse is pretty much just a huge mess of hot/cold debris.
