Rotationverse
is like a neutron star, because it
spins
REALLY fast. It does a 360º in only 0.07 seconds, but Rotationversians don't feel
so good
the fast
rotation
on their verse, because they are inside of it, it is like the earth, the earth is
spinning
, but we dont feel the
spin
. It’s also purple, but it used to be green.
