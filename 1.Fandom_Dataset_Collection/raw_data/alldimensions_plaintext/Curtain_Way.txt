Curtain Way is a doorway to realm between life and death, with only the dead can only enter the living world while the living cannot enter the dead world. There are sightings of paranormal activities and videos of them. The tall beings with black cloak at night, the naked black humanoid figure in the shadows, the ghosts peeking from under the beds, corner of the walls, etc... and they all mostly appear in the curtains or behind the windows, sometimes they don't appear at all, but they will make sounds or move objects to scare the living beings away. They are only invisible and cold until they decide to appear by opening the curtains and disappear by closing it back, they sometimes show themselves in daylight and mostly in abandoned places where they are used to the environment.
The size of the other world is as same as our universe, with only time is distorted and sometimes the events repeat themselves over and over, it contains all beings in the universe who died, and the dead felt more self-aware, the more evil they become.
