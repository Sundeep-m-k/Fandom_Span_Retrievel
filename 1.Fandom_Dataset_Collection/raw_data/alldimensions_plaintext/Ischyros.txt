Ischyros
is a strange, barely-known entity that wonders throughout.. well..
everything
. His origin is entirely unknown, along with basically any actual information about him.
He's 'visited' almost every single dimension, verse, or anything of that sort, but no entities contained in said dimensions or verses would have ever been aware of his presence.
Ischyros is a special case of power, in the fact that.. he doesn't have any. Well.. he does, but he doesn't.
Ischyros is entirely ambiguous, in all senses. Anything that you 'apply' to Ischyros, cannot be proven. If you state that he is powerless, it's entirely ambiguous. It is not true nor false. The same can be said if you say he is powerful. But since it's both at the same time, neither can be proven, meaning his can do whatever he wishes within that statement. Since this can applied to
anything
involving him, he can do
anything.
That statement is used a lot for 'gods', but heavy, heavy emphasis on
anything
.
If you were to say he existed within an objective, existing space, it would be entirely ambiguous. Saying he is undefinable, is undefinable. Sure, it would make sense to say "if he's undefinable, hes undefinable" but no. If he's undefinable, he cannot be defined as "undefinable" because that's defining him, and he cannot be defined. (that was a lot of define's)
There are many other things Ischyros is capable of, but listing them all here would create an infinitely long page. (This does NOT mean he is bound by infinity.)
In short, Ischyros is a mostly peaceful(?) entity, who wonders and minds his own business. In every place he visits, his presence is place as entirely ambigious in existing into that verse, so in no way can he be detected by anyone, even those who possess a form of 'omniscience' in their respective creations.
