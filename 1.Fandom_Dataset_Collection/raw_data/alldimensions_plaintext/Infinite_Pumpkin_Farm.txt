The Infinite pumpkin Farm is a place where all the snakes, pumpkins, striders, ants and spiders live in. Its a ''infinite'' 3 dimension grid consisting of snakes, spiders, and pumpkins. There are 6 biomes in the Infinite Pumpkin Farm. Also if you hear IPF, it means Infinite Pumpkin Farm in short.
Story
[
]
Once upon a time, there were children that had seen a simulation named ''Infinite Pumpkin Farm''. They were confused on what it was, so they activated the simulation, but then... A UNKNOWN GOD APPERED! He made the simulation real. All the creatures escaped and caused chaos, everyone was scared, so the god took it out and placed it in space. The people who made the simulation said ''Well, good thing nobody died... but you children have lost it... WHY DID YOU NOT SAY THAT YOU WHERE GONNA ACTIVATE IT!? YOU EVEN PRESSED RANDOM BUTTONS!'' So the children run away, never seen again...
You can also add stuff to the story, my story telling is very bad.
Biomes
[
]
There are 8 biomes that are randomly genarated in the Infinite Pumpkin Farm. The biomes can change if there is a change in the pumpkins/snakes/spiders.
Plains: A normal grassy hill that snakes, spiders, striders, ants, and pumpkins are in. 50% water, 50% sunlight.
Hills: A rainy (sometimes snowy) biome where small pumpkins with big violet colored thick leaves live in. The snakes here are big and friendly, the spiders here are small hunters that leach off of the big snakes. Ants here attack anything they see that moves, they are also very big and strong. The striders here have are big, blind, and omnivores. 75% water, percent 35% sunlight.
Desert: A harsh, dangerous biome where big pumpkins with red thick leaves live in ponds of water. The striders here have big wings that they use too fly and get rid of heat. Here, the snakes, ants, and spiders here are tiny, energy saving, dangerous creatures. 25% water, 85% sunlight.
mountains: A very snowy, cold biome where there are huge pumpkins with super thick violet colored leaves that turn the snow into water with their heat. The snakes here are big, dangerous, creatures that eat and hibernate. The spiders on the other hand are very big, friendly, calm, cute. But the striders are big, friendly, wingless creatures. There are boids of ants that move and eat anything that they see. 90% snow, 10% sunlight.
Ocean: A water filled place where the spiders swim and eat. The striders here are just swimmers that eat the spiders. The water pumpkins here have huge green long leaves that stretch out to get the sunlight. The spiders here can vary. some spiders hunt, and some spiders just eat the water pumpkins. (there are also no ants here) And because of that, a stable ecosystem is in the oceans. 100% water, 40% sunlight.
Jungle: A wet, very hot biome with giant pumpkins with green colored leaves that take up a lot of sunlight, the rest of the pumpkins are small, energy saving pumpkins that have green colored leaves.  The snakes here are small, harmless creatures that feed on the giant pumpkins and ''shrubs''. The striders crawl on the giant pumpkins, drink their juices, and throw small pumpkins at the spiders. The ants here are small and friendly. The spiders on the other hand are are big, tanky, dangerous predators that rely on echolocation to spot and eat their prey. There are a lot of tiny snels in this biome, but they all live under pumpkins. 75% water, 75% sunlight.
Valley: Like the hills, but upside down! More snow, less rain. 35% snow, 55% sunlight, 10% water. Also the spiders here are huge and they might eat over 450kg of pumpkins every day to live. This is one of the few places where snels live.
Pumpkin Forests: Like plains, but full of trees that have pumpkins growing on them! 50% water, 50% sunlight, 10% snow. Monkes live in these trees, and often feed off of the pumpkins that grow on them. The snakes here try to eat the monkes sometimes but usually they don't succeed. Also the striders here are all dead....................................................................................................................don't ask why. there may be massive ant colonies in pumpkin forests which might take down trees for easier access, but usually the monkes will stop them or at least delay that, .,. Ant colonies in pumpkin forests can be as large as 2 trillion ants. Snels live here, but they aren't very common. There are also ponds that occur in pumpkin forests, sometimes they have crocodiles living in them but there are massive underwater pumpkins in them which are very nutritious and may act as a food source for a long time for whatever. However, accessing those pumpkins is a very difficult task as usually there will be a crocodile preventing stuff from getting to them. Contrary to what you might believe,
the trees are not alive.
The height of a tree can range from 2 meters to 117 meters, however most things in pumpkin forests can climb trees, which is typically easy loot unless something is already there, which there usually is due to the high presence of monkes.
Pumpkins
[
]
The pumpkins are a good food for the snakes, spiders, ants, and striders. it lets them grow a body segment, or the snakes, spiders, and striders can just make a body segment bigger. Pumpkins have control over some stuff, those are: Nutrient amount, pumpkin size, color, leaf size, leaf amount, growth time, seed amount, and pumpkin amount.
Evolution (Pumpkin)
[
]
Nutrient amount is how much food a pumpkin gives. (it needs time and energy for a pumpkin to have a lot of Nutrients)
Pumpkin size is how massive a pumpkin. is (a bigger pumpkin can store more nutrients, but it costs energy to make a bigger pumpkin)
Color is what kind of light a pumpkin absorbs. (violet would be useful if there is not much light, but red would be useful if there was alot of light. And so on)
Leaf size is how much sunlight a pumpkin absorbs. (but it would be dangerous to make a leaf big, its because a big leaf can get ripped by the wind easily. So a pumpkin leaf may evolve to be sturdier and more thick)
Leaf amount is how many leafs a pumpkin has.
Growth time is how fast a pumpkin grows. (but its very inefficient to always make a pumpkin grow insanely fast)
Seed amount is how many seeds a single pumpkin makes. (like growth time, its very inefficient and energy costing to pump out huge amounts of seeds)
Pumpkin amount is how many pumpkins a pumpkin plant has. (its pretty useless and energy costing to make a huge amount of pumpkins)
Aquatic is whether or not it can grow underwater.
Snakes
[
]
Snakes are more interesting then the pumpkins and spiders. They aren't real snakes as they can only move around 8 directions and can only eat pumpkins. Also if they bump into something, nothing will happen, the snakes can also stop moving. But that's not it. They have organs and limbs that they can move around with. They also have control over a lot of things, and I mean a lot.
They control: Speed, body segment size, mass, evolving rate, thinness, health, armor, regen, teeth, tongue, baby amount, brain, limbs, organs, eyes, and boids
Evolution (snake)
[
]
Speed is how fast a snake goes. (too much speed will drain  alot of energy)
Body segment size is how big a body segment is. (a bigger segment will need more food)
Mass is how much a snake can push. (it also effects speed)
Evolve rate is how fast something evolves. (for a snake to evolve really fast, it needs a rotten pumpkin. A rotten pumpkin appearing has a 0.01 chance)
Thinness is how sharp a snake can turn. (if a body segment is to thin, any snakes that accidentally hit it will snap that body segment)
Health is how many hitpoints a snake has. (hitpoints are consistent to body segment size. Also if a body segment is big, it wont spread the whole hp to every body segment)
Armor is how protected a snake is (if armor is to thick a snake will have a hard time moveing around)
Regen is how fast a snake heals. (if the regen is going to fast it will waste alot of energy)
Teeth is how hard a snake can bite. (they may use it for hunting spiders, also it costs energy to bite hard)
Tongue is how far a snake can reach to food. (if a tounge is to long it will drain alot of energy just to move it)
Baby amount is how much a snake makes babies. (if a snake makes a huge amount of babies, it will take a huge amount of care and energy)
Brain is how smart a snake is. (a snake can have an intelligence of an ant or a elephant and even rememberÂ !)
Limbs are what the snakes here can use to move around with. (they can have limbs or not. Its also much efficient to walk then to sliher around like that)
Organs are what snakes have. (snakes can improve any organ the want, but it costs alot of energy)
Eyes are what allow the snakes to see. (better eyes cost more energy to use)
Boids are how snakes group up. (there can even be a queen snake that commands the boid it controls over, or there can just be a boid that does its own thing)
Spiders
[
]
Spiders are way less interesting than snakes and pumpkins. Spiders are also very basic, they also have no organs aside from just a brain. They are very unintelligent and are capable of just a few things, including: Throwing pumpkins in random directions, eating parts of pumpkins, jumping, walking in random directions, breaking into small pieces (they can actually control this)
Spiders, unlike snakes, do not group up at all.
Spiders reproduce asexually so they just multiply like a bacteria.
Controls: breaking into small pieces and reproducing.... that's it.
Evolution (Spider)
[
]
Evolution is completely random, the spiders just do stuff at anything and anywhere at all the time. Here, it's just picked.
Brain is how smart a spider is..... this is a fixed value that cannot be changed and will always be the same no matter which spider it is.
Echolocation is how a spider tells where its at. The spiders sometimes live without it. (it costs energy just to echolocate, there is also no slider to echolocation)
Body segment is how many body segments a spider has. (but the body segement are only the back of the spider, makeing the body segments look like a ball. Also there can be legs on the body segment)
Acua is if a spider can live in water. (they can live in land or on water)
Gills is how a spider gets oxygen in water. (the spiders can live on land or water)
Eyes are what allow the spiders to see and they have none; they are blind and just move randomly. Not what you'd expect a spider to be.
Limbs are what spiders use to move. The limbs can be long, thick, tall. This can very be usefull in water. They have 8 legs (usually) but sometimes they can have even more.
Skin thickness is how thick a spider's skin is, functioning similar to snake armor. But if they have very thick skin, they move slowly and if they have very thin skin, they are faster at the cost of health. Too thick and it can't move, too thin and it dies to a raindrop, snake, or anything else that crushes or bites it.
Evolve rate is how fast spiders evolve, but its much like brain size. (It needs also needs a rotten pumpkin just like the snakes)
Teeth is how fast a spider can eat a pumpkin. (at the cost of energy) Usually it takes around 5 minutes for a spider to eat a whole pumpkin.
Size is how big a spiders body segment is. (just like snakes, a bigger body segment needs more food)
Multiplication speed is how fast a spider can make more of itself. (but it costs a huge amount energy, and its really inefficient too multiply super fast)
Multiplication count is how many times a spider can make more of itself. (just like Multiplication speed, it costs a huge amount of energy just too make alot of itself)
Striders
[
]
Striders are a combination between snakes and spiders. This can happen if a spider shares its genetic traits with a snake, and because of that, a strider is born. striders are very special and strong, They can even multiply by their own, and Striders like to burrow deep underground and suck on the pumpkins roots. The striders can have spider legs, eyes, organs, limbs, and much more, they are just a combination of a snake and a spider.
Onto the evolution bits.
Evolution (strider)
[
]
Speed is how fast a strider walks. (it costs energy too do so)
Egg amount is how many eggs a strider lays. (but it costs a huge amount of energy to lay a huge amount of eggs)
Armor is how protected a strider is. (it slows them down if they have a thick layer of armor)
Skin is how thick a striders skin is. (skin does not slow them down alot, but it costs energy to regenarate skin)
Gills make the striders breathe underwater. (the striders can breathe underwater or on land)
Growth rate is how big a strider grows as a child. (but it costs energy too grow fast as a child)
Mass is how much a strider can push (it effects speed tho)
Organs are how many organs a strider has. They only need a heart, stomach, lungs and intestines to live, but they can have much more. (they can also upgrade the organs if they want)
Brain is how smart a strider is. (but the brain only scales with the bodys size)
Eyes are how far/good a strider can see. (but it costs energy to maintain those eyes)
Wings are how much a strider flys fast. (but better wings need more energy too fly)
Spider legs is how big or how many spider legs a strider has. (it needs more energy just to use bigger legs)
Limbs are how many limbs a strider has. (spider legs also can have more joints, also limbs still use energy just to move them around)
Teeth is how hard a strider can bite. (it costs energy to bite hard)
Ants
[
]
The ants are the only creatures to make colonys, pumpkin farms, and much more. The ants are the only ones that can grow a body segment on a body segment, thus, its why civilisations sell them for money. The ants comunicate with long tongues streching from their bodys and mouths, they even can strech their bodys, and more. Sadly the ants cant share their genetics.Â :(
Evolution (ant)
[
]
The ants can share their traits with the other ants, Thats why they thrive. Together. Is. Better.
Speed is how fast an ant walks. (the walk speed value can only be changed by 10 or 1)
Antenna is how far an ant can communicate. (it takes energy to communicate long distanses)
Mouth is how hard an ant can bite. (it costs alot of energy to bite hard)
Tongue is how far an ant can communicate. (but it takes energy to grow)
Size is how big an ant can get. (the ants can only grow to 3 meters before crumbleing down)
Boids are how many ants there are in a boid. (a queen can command the ants, or the boids can just do whatever they want)
Eyes are how well an ant can see. (but it costs energy to use good eyes)
Brain is how smart an ant is. (Its just like the snakes)
Peace is how friendly an ant is. (they can also be aggressive)
Shell is if an ant hides in a shell or not. (a shell greatly effects speed, a shell can be stronger, or bigger. But those effect speed)
Crocodile
[
]
Crocodiles are a type of reptile with narrow long jaws. they are the some of the only predators here and eat snakes and snels.
They have four limbs and a strong bite force able to make a pumpkin explode. their bite force is equivalent to 9,200 PSI, so they can annihilate pumpkins.
Snels
[
]
Snels are a type of OBJ in IPF that suck nutrients from pumpkins. Their predators are Snakes and Crocodiles
They are 9-12 cm long.
Evolution (snel)
[
]
Brain = smort
Peese = frendly!!!
Shell is always set to 1, all snels have shells.
eye = isite!!
Suction is how fast a snel can SUCC all of the nutrients out of a pumpkin, it takes a shit ton of energy to have good succ.
Speed is how fast they are, they are usually very fast
Snel variants
[
]
there are many snel variants, these are basically just variations of the default snel
Succ snel
[
]
Succ snels are able to succ tons of nutrients out of pumpkins and max everything out. Only problem is that maxxed out snel = GOOT food for corcodillos.
Fast snel
[
]
Fast snels are able to outrun corcodillos, but they have to succ fast to maintain enough energy to go around that fast. They are typically 30-60% faster than a default snel.
Hard snel
[
]
Hard snels have very hard shells to protect them from crocodiles and snakes.
Parasitic snel
[
]
Parasitic snels latch onto the skin of a larger animal, such as a snake, and drink their nutrients.
Monkes
[
]
Monkes are actually just primates, and they live in pumpkin forests and jungles and consist on a diet of pumpkins and ants. They are one of the only lifeforms in IPF that can climb trees.
Evolution (monke)
[
]
GS = grip strength, basically how long it can hold onto a tree branch. this is important for climbing trees to escape stuff like crocodiles
ATK damage = attack damage, self explanatory.
SPD = speed
bran = how smart a monke is, high Bran can mean that they can group up into large groups, among other things.
Boibs = how large groups of monkes are.
Multiplication = how many monkes a monke can produce
Evolution speed = evolution speed.
Monke variants
[
]
orang
[
]
orangs like to hang out in trees in pumpkin forests and eat pumpkins, they are also pretty smart with a bran value on average of 150.
chemps
[
]
chemps like to do much of the same, but they have a bran value of 220 on average and like to group up and kill eachother for fun and also because meat = shit ton of protein which is very useful.
grills
[
]
grills do not climb trees, preferring to eat ants and pumpkins and have a bran value on average of 185.
monkys
[
]
monkys vary widely, but they are like orangs but small and might group up into large groups.
thats not a monke
[
]
get that out of the page you bumbler
The very big squash
[
]
While most plants in IPF are just pumpkins, there is one very big squash located in the middle of a plain. The reason why it is so big is because it sucked up all of the nutrients from the ground and stole all the roots from the other pumpkins, but it stopped doing anything 8,000 years ago, some crocodiles tried to destroy the very big squash because it was extremely nutritious, but the squash was so thick that they couldn't pierce its skin because of how tough it was. The very big squash or VBS is around 60 meters wide, and towers above anything else in the plain. There are also no pumpkins around it (in a 15 meter radius).
