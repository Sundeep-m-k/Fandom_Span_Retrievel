Kaip̈ 7+671~R
(Better known as
Orbitverse A
) is the only binary verse in
The Box
. It is in our multiverse, but it is very far away from our universe. It orbits Kaip̈ 9+143=L (Better known as Orbitverse B), which is smaller than the Orbitverse.
Orbitverse Aians sometimes travel to Orbitverse B, and sometimes Orbitverse Bians travel to Orbitverse A. If you exclude the fact that they orbit each other, Orbitverse A is similar to
Lifeverse
, and Orbitverse B is the mixture between Lifeverse and
Deltaverse
.
