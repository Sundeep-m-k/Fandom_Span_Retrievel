The
Knot Chains
are
chains
that contain all knotverse types, such as the
trefoilverses
,
Figure-Eightverses
,
Cinqueverses
, etc.
Because there are infinitely many knots, we find chains out of them.

Here are the first few types of objects in the Knot Chains:
Trefoilverses (shaped like
3
1
{\displaystyle 3_{1}}
knots)
Figure-Eightverses (shaped like
4
1
{\displaystyle 4_{1}}
knots)
Cinquiverses (shaped like
5
1
{\displaystyle 5_{1}}
knots)
Three-Twiverses (shaped like
5
2
{\displaystyle 5_{2}}
knots)
Stevedoverses (shaped like
6
1
{\displaystyle 6_{1}}
knots)
...
Cinquiverses
[

Example of a Cinquiverse.
The
Cinquiverses
are
verses
shaped like
Cinquefoil knots
. They look similar to a star, and Cinquiverses are made from Figure-Eightverses, and also sometimes Trefoilverses which come from Figure-Eightverses colliding. Some properties of Cinquiveses is that actually inside them it is completely full of
moquarks
shaped into a hypercubic grid. This causes Cinquiverses to be very dense, combined with Figure-Eightverses being so tightly packed, Cinquiverses are one of the strongest objects of their size class discovered.
Size

The size of elements in the Knot Chain varies dramatically, so here's a chart based on relative size:
Name
Dimensionality
Trefoilverse
ℵ

{\displaystyle \alef_2}
Figure-Eightverse

{\displaystyle \aleph_{\aleph_0}}
Cinquiverse

{\displaystyle I}
or likely
ℵ

{\displaystyle \aleph_{\infty}}
Stevedoverse

{\displaystyle I_{I}}
By the time we get to Stevedoverses, they'll likely be already larger (in dimensionality) than
THE atoms
(although the number
ℵ

+
ℓ
)
ℵ
ℵ
9
{\displaystyle \aleph _{\infty \times (\mho ^{\mho +\ell })}^{\aleph ^{\aleph _{9}}}}
isn't well-defined).
The limit of all these knots has a dimensionality of
I
(
1
,
0
)
{\displaystyle I(1,0)}
, or the first 1-innaccessible cardinal.
