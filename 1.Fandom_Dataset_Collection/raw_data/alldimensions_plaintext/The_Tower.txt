The Tower
is a superheated tower in contrast to the
Treeverses
and a video game within the
Setverses
. It is a game where an unknown post-
Bubble Blower
entity runs up spiral stairs to avoid fire in the endless tower. You can see him pass by every 275 OYC from the view in a Setverse.
There are side rooms with Treeverses stuffed in them, and at the top is a chest that, when opened, explodes into Treeverses, the currency for the game. Dobers breathe on the walls to condense it somehow, and the Dobers are stronger than Kicken and dissapear when they don’t breathe. Their breath is hot enough to melt many things within this Realm. The Tower also burns you to death whenever you touch part of it, being able to melt a
Bongus
. Sometimes fire catches Treeverses and many verses die, however many of the trees in Treeverses are fireproof, which is a relief.
This verse’s room is covered by a barrier that calls KING DOBER, an extra-powerful variant of the aforementioned Dober entities, to kill you. The tower falls and bursts into flame whenever somebody hacks the Setverse it is in. All entities in The Tower contain Treeverses as drops, and the inventory of the protagonist uses superverse-like hyperdimensional layering to store their Treeverses.
