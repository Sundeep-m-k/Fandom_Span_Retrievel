Montos
are the mountain-like surface that covers
Infinitesimally Small Cylinders
. Their surface is very bumpy. Due to them being so small, their temperature is not known, but considering they're a part of the I.S.Cs, then it most likely would be the same theoretical temperature.
Objects this small are so unstable, that if an object smaller than the Montoses themselves were to touch them for 10^-2000000000 seconds, it would create an explosion larger than an
Omniverse
. Due to this factor, there is no known life on Montoses. Still though, more and more is being researched about them, so this statement may change in the future.
