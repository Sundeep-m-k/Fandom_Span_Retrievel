The
Glome
is a verse that is shaped like a
glome
, or a 4D hypersphere. It contains the previous rotatopes in the chain, being
The Tesseract
,
The Cubinder
,
The Duocylinder
, and
The Spherinder.
However, it does not always contain the first three, but The Glome will always contain at least one Spherinder.
Unlike the previous rotatopes, The Glome has no hyperspherical barrier, but is also not a barrier in itself.
Composition

]
The Glome, from the scale of ∞(0,ω
ω
), actually is more like a very thin sheet of paper, having layers of previous rotatopes to form the shape of a glome. Because of how higher dimensions work, if you had something inside The Glome, it could escape by just jumping out of it.
Because of this, The Glome is actually shaped like a glome, but it has slight depth in the other ∞(0,ω
ω
) dimensions.
