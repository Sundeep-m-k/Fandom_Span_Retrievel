The Loop i
s a phenomenon impossible for the mind to comprehend because of the combination of all possible achievable verses and impossible verses together with non-existent verses. All objects in the loop retain most of their physical properties (excludes Avogadro's law and Hubble's law) due to the lack of impact from other verses and the continuity of intangible lines
Construction
[
]
The content of The Loop is unknown due to its immateriality and is formulated in the statement < Everything ∓ The Box >.
The attempt to look at The Loop ends in a paradox because it is contained in itself. The appearance of the loop can be described from the same formula as the
external theory
.
The Loop's theory of impossibility
[
]
The Loop is a non-matter space that connects most material objects and by curving their space leads to a reversal of the
Gorduxeals process
.
The reversal of the process of creating space in other planetary collections, e.g.
The Universe
leads to the crossing of
matter
of material objects and their deflection which creates
"The Loop's theory of impossibility"
This theory assumes that no additional matter outside The Loop with a positive value is able to come into contact with objects in The Loop, which would create a double collapse The Loop and create a
third value
.
