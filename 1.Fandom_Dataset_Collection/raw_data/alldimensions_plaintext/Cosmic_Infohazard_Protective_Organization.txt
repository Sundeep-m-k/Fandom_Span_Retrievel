Hello! We are the
Cosmic Infohazard Protective Organization
,  a company founded by the government (and two people) to protect our species from cosmic threats. We specialize in research on infohazardous objects and ideas. We have over 2,500 sites concentrated in various areas including capitals: (Earth, Mars, Canston, Dubiourth, Spen)
History

Hello there! Our company was founded in 8522, when two people named Joseph Williams and Robert Adams wondered about the existence of "infohazards". These things were extremely dangerous as no one could ever know about them and no one could ever tell you about them, which completely hindered research efforts. So, they tried to start their first company on Speracal (located south-western Milky Way). They first named the company "Infohazards Corporation" and tried to get their government to help them. Fortunately, their government offered lots of funding (approximately 250,000,000,000 Galactic Menthers), allowing them to expand their workforce.
The first infohazard shielding rooms were very simple. Most rooms only offered psychic, physical and reality-manipulation resistance along with memory erasure when exiting rooms. These were able to significantly combat many infohazards, but these rooms were big and bulky. The first infohazards were discovered and documented by our company in 8523, when a worker successfully built an infohazard shielding room and conducted research within it. Still, infohazardous research could only be done in a very limited way, and we could only document 1 to 2 new infohazards every month. No one outside of these rooms could know about them, and so, something had to be done about this.
In 8544, a project known as
Project Xulphyrus
had began. The main goal of this project was to develop less bulky and better infohazard-shielding. The project was completed in 8547 when a group of researchers discovered a way to make infohazard-shielding suits. These could be worn by an individual, allowing for much better communication. The amount of discoveries skyrocketed to 20 or even 40 infohazards every month. Unfortunately, in 8552, the founders were attacked by an infohazard unprotected and were found dead in their offices by several researchers.
After that, the new CEO of the organization was Cary Hughes, a high-ranking researcher and spy. He eventually changes the name to "Cosmic Infohazard Protective Organization", how it is today. We document many different types of infohazards, such as large aggressive and adaptive conceptuals, idea space, paradoxical death concepts, and a very notorious adaptive infohazard, The Hazosphere. See below for more information.
Research
[
]
Our current research revolves around developing better tools and exterminating aggressive infohazards. For example, The Hazosphere, is a subject of extensive research. It is quite large, known to surpass
A1-0
. Our main projects revolve around Portable Black Box Generators (PBBG), Human-Understandable Concept Extermination (HUCE), and one of the largest projects conducted to date: The Counteractive Idea Evolution Experiments (CIEE). The Hazosphere is extensively studied as it lies at the current scales that these instruments can interact with, allowing for significant experimental testing possible.
