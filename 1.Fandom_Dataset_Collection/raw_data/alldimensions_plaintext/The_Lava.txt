What The Lava is
[
]
The Lava
is a tool used by the
creator
. It is a tool to erase anything;
the creator
uses it when he thinks something should be wiped out or by creating something on accident. The lava is not only for that, as it has many other uses such as heating other places or making a volcano. The lava is a very hot tool, approximately 1200°C.
Locations
[
]
Lava is mostly located in volcanoes, but sometimes (ultra-rarely), there will be verses made with lava or rivers of lava in planets / stars, which is created by the heating of water. The water would heat too much and instead of turning to rain, it would turn to lava, then spread across. If it is near a river, it will spread it all across the river leading to the lava to form.
Formations lava could make
[
]
Lava could make very cool things. Those are most likely to be stone, obsidian or hot cobbledstone, but there are many more, like the fact that lava can make a entire lavaverse with just enough patience,
the creator
could easily wait to fill a entire useless verse with lava and call it a lavaverse, but thats would be not so smart, lava will turn hotter and destroy the universe making it burn all the cosmic around the verse, leading to its death.
A verse that is filled with lava
[
]
There is a verse that called
Sortaverse
which is an archverse, specifically part of the
Extended Divergent Archverses
and is made entirely of lava.
Size
[
]
The size of the lava is unknown, that would be crazy to count, sortaverse, lava riverse, thats too big, theoretically saying, they think the size is
ω
5
345
{\displaystyle \omega ^5345}
but we dont know if thats true, for now the "theoretical" size will be The true size, but theoretically speaking, you shouldve known.
Average size of a lava
[
]
The average size of lava is 600 m, but its the average size of LAVA itself, the average size of lava in a volcano is 1.4 km, the size of lava in a river is 8.5 km, the size of lava in a sea / ocean, is 400 km, lastly, the size of lava in the sortaverse is

LY, the sizes are pretty fast changing and massive, those are most sizes, there are few we didnt cover, but we wont for now.
