About
[
]
Shirroverses
are
verses
which contain
Gigaverses
and are one of the brightest and flashiest known verses ever.
Glowth
[
]
These verses shine so bright, in fact, that all verses above then up until
Omniverses
have a glowing part in the middle of them, that part being the one Shirroverses are mostly found at. They're so bright that they can shine through something that absorbs 100% of light, such as a
black hole
or above.
Formation
[
]
The immense radiation glow of the Shirroverses comes from their initial formation, being that seeds of verses quantum tunnel to exact spots in the Omniverses the Shirroverses will eventually be located in, instantly repelling with unstoppable force and creating them.
This repulsion converts 99.99999999999999999993482% of verse seeds' mass into energy, and converted energy is once again entirely converted into
photons
that are adapted to work in the Omniverses. Leftover
mass
of seeds then drag all photons in again, and with tremendous booms, the Shirroverses now have all photons withing them.
Why they affects outside worlds
[
]
Shirroverses have a gigantic radiation pressure that is able to destroy structures like Gigaverses and convert them into countless expanding energy bubbles. Energy bubbles can merge into bigger bubbles, but they are very rare cases. Without any inside force, the bubbles collapse back from enormous radiation pressure of the Shirroverse's space. the mixture of superdense energy is entirely converted into light.
Flash from popping energy bubbles are one pulse, but over the size of the Shirroverses, energy of the pop pulses are lengthened to long wave, emitting static blows from them.
Unique properties of Shirroverse

Shirroverses can replicate occasionally by spitting out part of one of their regions either by some huge explosion or local decrease of explosion activeness splitting Shirroverses.
