The
Glitch Space
is an infinite continuum of floating
Glitch Spaces
. It is so broken by
THE TIGERs
that existence states themself have a "conditional state", which is an existence state for satisfying properties of existence states. Conditional states are also infinite-dimensional and also formed from the Cayley-Dickson construction. Conditional states themselves have their own conditional state, and so on.
THE TIGERS kill
Bees
, preventing this beast from being repaired. Even if
Bees¬†didn
't die, the
Dogy
would still get killed. That would mean that
Bee
wouldn't know how to repair The Glitch Space; the Bee relies on Dogy to know what is wrong in
The Glitch Space
.
The only region that isn't super chaotic is the edge, which contains very normal Glitch Spaces (not to be confused with The Glitch Spaces).
