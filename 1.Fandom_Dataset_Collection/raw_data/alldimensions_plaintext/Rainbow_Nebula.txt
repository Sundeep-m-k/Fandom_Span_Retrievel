The first rainbow nebula recorded in 2000 with an electron telescope-camera-human-eye type thing.
Introduction
[
]
The rainbow nebula is a nebula that is rainbow in color. It is also known as "üåàüåå‚òÅ" (pictogram). They're commonly so big, they look like a straight line, but some people have sightings of rainbow nebulas in space, and our rainbow nebula looks like an ‚àû, the rainbow colors they have are suspected to be made out of
rainbowid
( chemical symbol: RD, 155th element which reflects light into it's different colors), which is the element that gives rainbow objects their rainbow color. We don't have much info on these types of nebulas, since rainbow nebulas somehow disrupt almost all types of camera/ camera-type things (except human eyes).
