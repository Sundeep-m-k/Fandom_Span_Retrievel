Definition
[
]
Treneversei (Treh-neh-verse-ay) is a verse that isn’t in the set of everything (
Totum
), this verse is a Rombi paradox. (Going beyond the limits of something that is limitless.)
This verse transcends the concept of containing, beyond this verse are verses with very FG-like definitions, so be careful about what you define, for just saying that a verse contains a verse beyond this won’t cut it.
Other interesting things
[
]
Treneversei was created after
Totum
in the canon timeline, meaning a Transobservable being created it.
Treneversei experiences a constant rumbling, which is loud enough to even vibrate the absence of air.
Arguments and explanations

“The option to create the final verse is voted” < “I personally don’t think trying to end something that the community has developed and will forever do just because you don’t like it is right, voted or not. there’s also a LOT of issues with fandom polls.”
