Introduction
[
]
Xenum
is the 10,000th element added to the
periodic table
. It's initials are Xem. It is a non-metal that is green when solid at -100Â°C. It is found naturally in
xenoverses
in a shiny black liquid state, although it exists in a
universe
as
black energy
. Strangely, most scientists that research it say it has no gas state.
Uses
[
]
It is indestructible except if exposed to
toxicium
which makes it explode, turning it into
tentron
or
ditoxicium tetraxenum
. This compound is a great building material for spaceships that travel between verses. It is resistant against conflicting gravity fields, malleable and lightweight. It can also react to
toxicuandaic slurry
to make a popular drink known as TCX.
Discovery
[
]
The element was discovered in the year 3079, by John Halsey, who was one of the first people to enter a xenoverse. He took a sample of it and found out it was a new element after researching it. This caused a flurry of excitement as a new element hadn't been found for 70 years.
This element has made up an alien species: the
Bellanoids
, which were minding their own business wandering their
multiverses
after they had to flee their xenoverse when humans invaded, generally avoiding humans until repeated human invasions obliterated them.
