The dark monster who dwelves within
the Dark Basement
's deepest, darkest parts shrouded in mystery, he who wishes to be freed from his cold dark prison to devour all, Fhorgom. Fhorgom is our
Alphasm
's descendant, though not quite as powerfull and all knowing.
History
[
]
Fhorgom was once created by the very same being that made our
Alphasm
, however he was banished to the Dark Basement after slaughtering countless lifeforms and trying to kill the other entities, being stuck in darkness, he cried out for help, a cry no one could hear. As time passes, his memory faded. He turned more gruesome and became darker and darker, seeking revenge when one day he shall escape and wreak havoc, but as of now he stays trapped devouring lower beings in the Dark Basement.
Abilities and Strength
[
]
Fhorgom is able to completely erase that is weaker than him, however stronger beings are more resistant.
Fhorgom is also capable of creating portals, however they are limited since they cannot be created outside the Dark Basement.
Fhorgom can also break through that unbreakable sphere, however being trapped in his cold dark prison below, he cannot do that yet.
He has almost full control over the Basement and it's creatures.
Due to Basement trapping him and suppressing his near limitless powers we haven't uncovered yet, he cannot unleash his full potential. When he does though, its a good idea to run or hide from Fhorgom.
