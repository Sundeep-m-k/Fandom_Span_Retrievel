Universes or space or copy's of itself
The Dyaverse is located in a massive structure made of trillions of Dyaverses. The Dyaverse is also connected to 3 other Dyaverses giving it a triangle shape if you look at it. (I apologize for this being a good/bad article I will try to upgrade it later.)

The connecting universes
[
]
The connecting universes are small  Dyaverses that connect to the Dyaverse the smaller ones do move very slowly like a planet and its moons. The smaller universes take 2 billion years to complete a full orbit around the main. If the connecting Dyaverses collide, the collided Dyaverse will almost instantly collide with the main making a super massive Dyaverse.
The cluster aka structure
[
]
The Dyaverse cluster.
The Dyaverse cluster is a massive place filled with Dyaverses the Dyaverse cluster makes a box shape (Not the box!) each Dyaverse almost being different from the last each one changing color or looking different.

Dyaverses are very rich with life. Some forms of life include very complex organisms to very horrific creatures that can eat galaxies whole, these creatures are massive creatures with a mouth that can eat galaxies whole.

taking up 30% and the last 10% being void. The biggest void there is named llh2-991-543 it contains nothing inside of it. llh2-991-543 is 6 thousand light years. llh2-991-543 is the only known void in the Dyaverse.
