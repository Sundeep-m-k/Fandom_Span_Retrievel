The Orbiting
The Chaos
is the verse right after
The Orbiting
. It is filled with
Primordium Omega
, even more so than
BOOD-VOOD-VAV
's realm. This makes the verse pretty much uninhabitable.
Formation
[
]
The Chaos was formed when
Alphasm
was messing around with a whole ton of
Blueprint Particles
. He accidentally created a few
Primordium Omega
particles, and due to how Primordium Omega will turn nearby particles into itself, the Primordium Omega collection kept consuming other particles and growing. This kept happening until the collection of particles grew so large that it swallowed
The Orbiting
.
Appearance
[
]
Since The Chaos is composed solely of Primordium Omega, The Chaos is completely black. This has made creatures think it is a void, which made them think that it was safe to go inside. Unfortunately, they all died due to the Primordium Omega.
Structure
[
]
The Chaos, due to its gargantuan size, has had the Primordium Omega in it form some strange structures on its outside. The inside of The Chaos is simply a huge collection of Primordium Omega.
