Origin
[
]
No consensus exists on the origin of Koilestels. They are said to originate from a tidally locked Earth-like planet in a spiral galaxy found within the Alaxige dimension,  however this information has been lost in time. They gradually shifted their matter bodies to carbon and produced energy from their inside. While their body was once humanoid, they have lost the equivalent of the right arm and have transformed it into a nuclear fusion device. Their internal organs have also vanished, leaving only the limbs as reminiscence of their past.
Description
[
]
Koilestels are plasma-based lifeforms who can produce carbon from the outside helium. They have traces of their humanoid-like forms, such as the optical receptors, which are as of now used only for rituals or intimidation. They are able to travel at lightspeeds.
Genders
[
]
Koilestels have a total of 4 genders: Female (breeding), Male (breeder), Sterile (intermediate) and Energetic. Reproduction requires 3 genders, the most common configuration being as follows: a male produces reproduction material that will enter an energetic's body, an energetic makes those materials able to be used for reproduction and inserts it inside a female's body. Sterile Koilestels cannot reproduce, but they are physically more powerful and prone to work and action that other genders are.
Societies
[

Koilestels are often found in intergalactic voids. However, they will on rare occasion enter galaxies and track wormholes, which is considered a dangerous job as Koilestels are particularly affected by black holes, for which a wormhole can be mistaken. They can save themself by travel faster than lightspeed, but they will lose much of their plasma components.
Koilestels are directly responsible for the creation of the
Glucoseverse

Half-Koilestels

Half-Koilestels are a hybrid between a Koilestel and a different species.
