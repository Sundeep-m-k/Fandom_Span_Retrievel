A
SMOLverse
is an object that composes objects the size of 0 somehow like
Protoverses
. Their size is also 0 because
X
∗
0
{\displaystyle X*0}
is 0 and
0
X
{\displaystyle \frac{{0}}{{X}}}
is also 0, so 0 can be composed of more 0s. Even any of the transfinite values such as
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
,
ε
0
{\displaystyle \varepsilon_0}
, or
ζ
0
{\displaystyle \zeta_0}
multiplied by 0 is 0.
Since the size is the same as a Protoverse, this would be at the same size as the Protoverse, but since it also composes 0-sized objects, it'd be smaller than Protoverse, but with the properties of 0 in this way, a SMOLverse can be composed of other 0-sized objects and Protoverse is a 0-sized object, so this would be bigger than Protoverse in the hierarchy. Just like molecules and atoms, where the atoms that compose the molecule also define the molecule's properties, SMOLverses also compose the properties of 0-sized objects through a complex process.
