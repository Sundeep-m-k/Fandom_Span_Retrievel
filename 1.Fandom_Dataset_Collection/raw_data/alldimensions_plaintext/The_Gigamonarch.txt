, which contains everything, is itself contained within The Gigamonarch. Thus, The Gigamonarch is the container of the container of all.
The Gigamonarch(7 CI) is a theoretical construct within hypercosmology, proposed as the ultimate container that encompasses all of existence, including every possible dimension, universe, void, and conceptual space. Essentially, it is the embodiment of containment itself, elevated to its highest form. The Gigamonarch transcends all physical laws, dimensional constraints, and logical frameworks, serving as the ontological foundation for all that is, was, or ever will be. You could say it is the "Structure" or "Foundation" of reality as a whole.
The existence of The Gigamonarch raises profound questions about the nature of existence itself. If everything, including the Void, is contained within it, what lies outside? The answer is nothing, for there is no outside, only
abstract frameworks
.
