The Insanity is an infinite void filled with absolutely nothing (excluding the creatures trapped in it). This verse has the interesting property to be able to completely make any creature go completely insane. This verse is nigh-impossible to escape, even with reality clipping and glitching.

Discovery
[
]
The Insanity was first discovered in 86
OYC
, when a
Yetmmud
appearance left a small portal to some unknown location. Interested creatures went inside it, only to see a void, and now what we call The Insanity.
The creatures stayed in The Insanity for years on end. Over time, all of them began to experience hallucinations and started to slowly go insane.
Here is a log of two of the creatures talking to each other in The Insanity. All of the dialogue has been translated into English.
Creature #1
"You know, I had no idea what I had gotten myself when I entered that portal."
Creature #2
"Yeah, you're right."
Creature #1
"What am I supposed to do?"
Creature #2
"Don't know. Anyways, I've been seeing a lot of things today. Don't know why. I know that there's nothing in this void, but I swear that I saw black creatures of some sort floating around."
Other uses
[
]
The Insanity has had other uses as well other than just being a blank void that makes you hallucinate and go insane.
The Insanity as a Prison
[
]
The Insanity, once the portal was found, was used as a prison by an extremely powerful civilization for some time. The government of the civilization used The Insanity as a place to dump all the troublemakers at. However, this practice was seen as unethical, and the prison was shut down.
The Insanity as a Test Chamber
[
]
The Insanity was also used by a corrupt government to dump test subjects at. This practice was continued for many
OYC
years, due to just how powerful the government was and how easy it was to trick creatures into believing the wrong thing. The Insanity stopped being used as a test chamber once the corrupt government got overthrown.
The Insanity as a Tourist Attraction
[
]
After The Insanity stopped being used as a testing chamber, it turned into a popular tourist destination. The Insanity, at its peak gained over 3.802 sextillion creatures from all over the cosmos. However, The Insanity got closed down to the public after a series of creatures that visited The Insanity started to hallucinate and later went completely insane.
Today, The Insanity is closed off to the general public and only Omni Gods and other extremely powerful gods can enter it.
Stages of Insanity
[
]
If you are trapped in The Insanity, there will be 5 "levels/stages of insanity". The higher the number, the more severe the hallucinations/illusions will get.
0th stage
[
]
This is what stage of insanity you will be in when you enter The Insanity for the first time. All you will see is a pitch black void, and nothing else. This stage isn't really considered a stage, since you don't experience any hallucinations or see/hear visual/auditory illusions at all.
First stage
[
]
If you stay in The Insanity for approximately 100 days, you will enter this stage of insanity. During this stage of insanity, you will see small white streaks going around everywhere in your vision.
Sub-First State A
[
]
This sub stage is when the white streaks are only in your peripheral vision.
Sub-First State B
[
]
This sub stage is when the white streaks seem to be everywhere, even in your frontal vision.
Second stage
[
]
This is the stage you will go into if you remain in The Insanity for approximately 750 days. The second stage of insanity is when the white streaks start to move back and forth. If you still remain in The Insanity, your entire field of vision will start to wobble back and forth. If you somehow leave The Insanity when in this stage, your brain/mind will already have suffered permanent damage.
During this stage of insanity, there will also be occasional "black creatures" of some sort that float around. This phenomenon has not been spotted in any other stage of insanity though.
Third stage
[
]
The third stage is when you remain in The Insanity for 10 Earth years, and also when things start to get bad. Other than your whole field of vision moving back and forth, there will start to be more colored streaks moving everywhere (this time, red and yellow). Also, you will start to hear voices in your head. It is extremely hard to hear what they are saying, and it is unknown if they are saying anything at all.
Fourth stage
[
]
You will enter the fourth stage of insanity if you stay in The Insanity for 15 Earth years. During this stage, your entire vision will begin to destabilize and the auditory/visual illusions will be unbearable. Your entire vision will now be a mess of white, red, blue, green, purple, orange, yellow, gray, and pink streaks and colors, and you will hear extremely loud screaming of some sort. This stage is where most victims die and do not recover.
Fifth stage
[
]
The fifth stage of insanity has never been reached by any mortal or regular creature before, and only gods, Omni gods, or Mary Sue-level gods will be able to reach this stage. You have to stay in The Insanity for a ridiculous
10
100
{\displaystyle 10^{100}}
years before you enter this stage. Some Mary Sue-level gods like
Gerald
and
Dunkey Kong
described this stage as "a swirling mess of 'everything possible, impossible, both, none, and others." The fifth stage is probably more than what Gerald and Dunkey Kong describe it as, since if they were to describe it in its entirety, regular creatures would die from trying to imagine just how messed up it is.
