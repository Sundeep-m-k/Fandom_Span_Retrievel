Introduction
[
]
A
Computerverse
is an enormous structure made of Metallium, an extremly buffed version of the metal. These are one of the biggest verses of all, even being a lot bigger than the
Windowsverse
. It not only can contain the Windowsverse, but can also contain other
Operationverses
. Very dangerous verses knowed as
Virusverses
can infect computerverses and damage them to a point they are soo unstable that they blow. Constantly there are entities building better walls to dont make Virusverses attack a computerverse. There are smaller versions of computerverses (like, WAY smaller) that are contained by
The Calculator
.
Components that make computerverses
[
]
Metallium
[
]
Metallium is the main component of all Computerverse, that protects Computerverses in a physical form. Thats why its bassicly impossible to destroy an Computerverse, except if you are an extremly powerfull entity / extremly powerfull Virusverse.
Screenium
[
]
Screenium is a component that allows the persons see what happens in a Computerverse. They also contribute making lots of 'verses inside their respective Computerverse.
Walls of infinity
[
]
The walls of infinity are an barrier that keeps Computerverses safe from Virusverses. If these walls couldnt exist, Computerverses would easily get destroyed. Some very strong Virusverses can pierce these walls, and they are extremly dangerous. But theres a very tiny amount of that type, so we are safe.
Evolution of Computerverses
[
]
Everytime some very strong and special entities try to upgrade the Computerverses, making them more stable, having better protective walls, etc. A new type of Computerverse could be ready in 5
OYC
s aprox, so wait a bit more so the Computerverse 324.5 releases!
