Kill everything and become most powerful
Kreplin is the 3rd most powerful fragment of
Him
. He was the one to send
Kraa
, his celestial brothe, into a spiral of evi. His plans were to kill
Kriplin
and
Googolploxio
, and absorb their energy to become the “Powerfuler Him”(sorry, he just likes this name, even with the errors). When Googolploxio imprisioned Kraa because of his fault, Kreplin cowardly left into
The Edge
. Graham‘s Googol years later, he returned and attacked some gods, which thought some other gods attacked them, thus starting
The Goddic War
. Googolploxio saw this and fused with Kreplin. To this day, Kreplin is still trapped inside Googolploxio, but is waiting to be released.
