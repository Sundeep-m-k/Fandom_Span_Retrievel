Temperature & Effects on
The Loop
[
]
The oven has a temperature that somehow surpasses the Infi-bit integer limit, which is
Î©
{\displaystyle \Omega}
degrees Celsius.  Apparently, The temperature didn't overflow the infi-bit integer system for itself, but it would be a valid explanation for why
The Loop
's temperature goes below absolute zero.
Size
[
]
The size of
The Loop
to The Oven is theoretically a much bigger jump than any other jump in
The Official Hierarchy
as it is the end of the loops (theoretically), and contains every
Loop
.
Outside of it
[
]
There's a theoretical abstract wave, made entirely from
Omni-Lava
, that people theorize exists outside of The Oven.  They think that the
Omni-Lava
wave is responsible for all type's of heat in the
Omni-Cave
and everything inside of it.
