The
Cloud God
is one of the
strongest, wisest, oldest and largest gods ever
.
The
Cloud God
is a heart-shaped, immortal entity, bearing the resemblance of a cloud and floating in the center of the
Cloudverse
. It is only a millionth of the verses size, as it uses the Cloudverse's materials
slowly
to exist. In exchange for absorbing materials from the Cloudverse, it allows
life and mega-colonies to flourish for eons
.
The chemical make up of the
Cloud God
is unknown, it appears to be
solid, like concrete, whilst having a white gas orbiting around it
. The gas reaches the surface, with a semi-major axis of

Some verses unfortunately end up in the whirlwind and get stuck
. This doesn't have a negative effect, but anyone attempting to leave has to teleport outside of the tornado, otherwise, leaving will be
much more difficult
