Metanumbers
are numbers beyond numbers to put it simply. They are an extension of
Metafinities
, as The Terminality of All Verses was the limit to them. We denote Metanumbers using by first using the symbol Myslite (Ⰿ), and then by assigning a number or Metanumber after it in subscript (i.e. The first Metanumber would be Ⰿ
1
). Even the smallest negative Metanumber (Ⰿ
Ⱄ
[
1
]
) is bigger than any possible number. You can also use M instead to make it compatible with the math formula function in the FANDOM editor.
