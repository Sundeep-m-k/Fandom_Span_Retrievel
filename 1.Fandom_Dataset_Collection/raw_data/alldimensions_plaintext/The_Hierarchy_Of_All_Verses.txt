Introduction
[
]
The Hierarchy Of All Verses (renamed from the Hierarchy of Everything, to avoid it being called the unfortunate name H.O.E.), is a hierarchy that, hopefully, will contain
nearly every page on this wiki.
It will be sorted into classes, and if one gets too big, it will be split. I will start with Official, Extended, Post, and Meta Hierarchies, then proceed to use an ‘alphabet soup method’, searching for aa, ab, ac, ad, and so on.
If you think a verse has been placed in the wrong category, comment or leave a message on my
talk page
.
For each verse I will also include a snippet of info about the verse. Just click on the blue "Info" text for information! For example…
Universe
|
Info
Pretty much considered the first verse, the verse we live in. Contained by
Multiverse
, contains
galaxies
and other bodies.
You can click on the 'Info' text again to hide it.
IMPORTANT NOTE! READ THIS!
The headers of the Sub-Classes and Classes are links! You can click on them to take you to their category page.
Also
, if something simply contains and is contained by the things below and above it in the hierarchy list. I see no need to tell you in the info tab.
Labelling of Verses
[
]
The verses will be divided into classes. Eg. Class 1 would be 'Finite verses'. They are divided into sub-classes such as 'Universe-sized', 'Contained By Universe', etc. These are labeled with decimal classes (Contained By Universe would of course be Class 1.1). And by going to the pages you will find that the verses have already been added to their respective categories as THOAV Class (something).
⊗ Unexistence Class (-3) ⊗
[
]
The
Unexistence Class
generally is where existence becomes out of the question. Pretty much containing Classes
-3
and
-4
, The Unexistence Class (for now) is the smallest class the THOAV will cover. The Unexistence Class basically contains the
Start-All-Be-Alls
of the protoworld.
As well as this, this class is pretty small, so it fits perfectly with the fact that it describes the smallest things.
Sub-Class -2.9: Start-All-Be-Alls

True nothing (true)
|
Info
It is supposedly the 'True' True Nothing. This suggest that
True Nothing
is a lie. It contains nothing yet, and is contained by the "true"
Anti Logic
.
Anti Logic (true)
|
Info
It is supposedly the 'True' Anti-Logic. This pretty much suggests that
Anti Logic
is a lie. It's contained by the "false"
True Nothing
and is contained by the "true"
True Nothing.
True Nothing
|
Info
This page, made by
Fish
, apparently deemed 'false', is described as being 'truly nothing' and not existing.
Primition
|
Info
The
Primition
doesn't actually directly contain
True Nothing
, but instead contains, well actually is, a smaller version of
The End-All-Be-All Barrier
. It basically makes an infinite loop in both directions. The sub-break (object below the loop) is, however, the
True Nothing
.
Anti Logic
|
Info
Anti Logic
is basically the building block of everything. It is the true abstract particle, so small it can't be defined.
Levenin
|
Info
Levenin
is the largest particle smaller than a
Nothingest
. There are 3 of them in a nothingest, and they can either be negative or positive. These basically control the movements of a nothingest in space, and that depends on what leveni are negative / positive.
Sub-Class -2.8: Non-Particles
[
]
Nothingest
|
Info
Nothingest is basically… the nothingest nothing. It is nothing compared to nothing. It’s so nothing that the page has almost no content… apparently.
Whyium
|
Info
The smallest non-particle in the
ENPL
. No real mumbo jumbo about anti-conceptuality. Just… why?
Noninius
|
Info
It is true nonexistence compared to the next one in the
ENPL
, like pretty much the rest of them. Nothing to say.

➑ Sub-Everything Class (-2) ➑
[
]
This is an analog to the The Pre-Hierarchy's
Sub-Xial Class
. It contains abstract dimensions, strange particles and not very-well defined ones. These particles are smaller than 0 itself.

(Least Restricted Definition is A Thing that contains the most stuff, but it tries to be the thing with the least stuff. This Basically Means that the LDR Nothing contains the most things of any Nothing Variant.)
