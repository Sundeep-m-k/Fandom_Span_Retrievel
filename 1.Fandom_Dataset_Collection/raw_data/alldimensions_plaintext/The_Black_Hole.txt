The Black Hole or The Enigma (another name) is a verse that contains
The Earth
is a paradoxical entity, holding a strange, expansive environment known as
The Ocean
. This formation, created by the misguided exploration of numerous civilizations, represents an unintended consequence of their quest to comprehend larger cosmic structures such as
The Box
,
The Last Void
,
Peraomniversal Complex
, and
The Bin
. Despite its massive size,
The Ocean
contains far less information than these other structures, rendering it one of the least informationally dense regions known.
Origin of The Black Hole and The Ocean
[
]
The emergence of
The Ocean
began when several advanced civilizations, seeking knowledge of the expanding
Archverse
chain and beyond, launched an ambitious program to send waves of energy across multiple
universes
. These
waves
would collect fragments of information as they passed through various -verses, ultimately reflecting off the largest structures they encountered, such as
the Bin
. However, the civilizations underestimated the scope of the -verses they were traversing, causing the waves to grow exponentially in size and collect far more information than initially anticipated. Upon exiting The Bin, the waves had expanded so much that they dwarfed the structure itself, creating an immense spatial phenomenon. This led to the formation of The Ocean, which filled the void around the Bin, holding the fragmented, minuscule information scattered across its vast expanse.
Nature of The Ocean
[

The Ocean, far exceeding the Bin in physical size, holds significantly less information due to the sparse nature of the data collected by the waves. The vastness of the Ocean is a result of the thin spread of this information, giving it a seemingly empty, but immense, structure. Over time, waves of information began to emerge within the Ocean itself, interacting with other *-verses and depositing data back into the universes from which the waves originated. Upon this realization, the researchers responsible understood the colossal mistake they had made. However, due to limitations in their ability to rectify the situation, they chose to accept the event as a natural anomaly, choosing instead to study the properties of this vast Ocean.
The most fascinating discovery within The Ocean was the peculiar behavior of information in the form of “happy information”, where spacetime behaves in unexpected ways around concentrations of information. This effect causes spacetime to be drawn inward near information concentrations, while being drawn outward away from these concentrations. When visualized, this relationship forms a smiley face, hence the name happy information.
The Earth Within The Ocean
[
]
Amid the vastness of The Ocean, there exists a rare, informationally dense area known as The Earth. These islands or continents within The Ocean are pockets of higher informational density that defy the expanding spread of the Ocean. Despite being a part of this larger structure, The Earth has unique properties that have drawn the attention of many scientists and explorers…
The Earth itself is a sad entity, as it is constantly being drained of its resources by various organizations that seek to exploit its vast potential. Theorists believe that the materials and information present within The Earth could be pivotal for interdimensional travel, particularly to locations like The Box or The Bin. However, these practices have sparked ethical debates, as the long-term consequences of such exploitation are unknown, and many are concerned about the irreversible damage caused by the extraction of resources. Despite the warnings, however, exploitation continues, and The Earth is left to suffer.
The Wave is an ongoing phenomenon that encompasses everything that exists, from the smallest particle to the largest cosmic structures. It represents the endless surrounding force that permeates every aspect of existence, nonexistence, and beyond. The Wave holds more information than any individual universe, reality, or dimension. It is both a destructive and creative force, constantly expanding and reshaping the very fabric of reality itself.
Conclusion

The Black Hole containing The Earth is an immensely complex and unstable structure formed through the collision of The Ocean and The Bin. Unlike conventional black holes, it does not follow a stable timeline; instead, time fluctuates unpredictably within it, influenced by the Coins that exist in The Bin. The Earth, an informationally dense area, exists as a stable “island” within this chaos. It is surrounded by The Ocean’s vastness and connected to The Bin’s infinite, shifting timelines. While The Black Hole draws in everything, entities with alternative existence ranks are immune, allowing The Earth to persist despite its precarious existence. The exploitation of The Earth’s resources raises ethical dilemmas, yet these practices continue, spurred by the potential to harness its power.
