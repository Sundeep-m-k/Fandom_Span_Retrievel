The
Adoqexonverse
is not where
Adoqexon
lives. It is the verse inside the
Blue Ring
along with
Bandiverse
.
Adoqexon has never been to this verse but he was the one to discover it. It was done using the Blueringistotallyatrianglelol telescope.
Inside this verse is mostly just letters. Not many phrases have been found, except for a few. They are:
what the hecc
diverse
created it
ring
The rest of them just seem to be letter spam, but they always start with "he", and then a few letters, like "heaa".
Structure

There are some hands and a face, but they are just for decoration.
