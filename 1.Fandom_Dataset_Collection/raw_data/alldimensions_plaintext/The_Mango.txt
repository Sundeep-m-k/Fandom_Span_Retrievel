Containing
Everything that doesn't contain black holes
The Mango is a large sized Mango that contains everything that doesn't contains black holes, it's arguable if it's larger or smaller then The
Vacuumverse
.
Why can't it be contained
[
]
The reason for it not being able to be conntaind is that,  becuase if there would be a verse that would contain the The Mango , then that verse wouldn't contain black holes, so The Mango already contains it because the Mango contains every thing that doesn't contain black holes, which makes it a paradox, so there can't be anything that doesn't contain it. Most of the verses that we need are probably aren't contained by this universe but anything that has no black holes in, is indeed contained by The Mango.
