An
Eeler
is a
godlike
creature
that is rarely formed upon the destruction of a
Barrel
. They are potentially very dangerous due to the ability to assimilate the abilities of a defeated creature. They turn into the much more powerful Great Eelers when a religion forms about the Eeler.

Normal Eelers are the weakest type of Eelers. They are always created with the sole intention of surviving and causing a religion that worships them, ascending it into a much more powerful variant known as Great Eelers. Despite that, even normal Eelers can destroy a post-
Teraversal
civilization
. They do not attack civilizations unless provoked, though.
