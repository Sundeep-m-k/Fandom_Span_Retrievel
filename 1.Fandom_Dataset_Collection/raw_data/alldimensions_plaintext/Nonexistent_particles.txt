Information about Nonexistent particles is strictly impossible to know
[
2
]
. This is due to Nonexistent particles being strictly impossible to define, as much as its information. Like, how in the world is anything going to be able to represent "Nonexistent particle is a
part
icle
that is
not a p
article
is a
cloud and not a cloud of property and is strictly
definable and undefinable, and it exists and does not exist
[

"? Well... at least... its near regions are pretty interesting as

Although the Nonexistent particle's "
exist
ency
" is undefinable, it still affects its surrounding environment. The area around Nonexistent particles becomes a condition somewhat
similar to th
at of a verse
, and as you
zo
om
in further into the center of the influential region, the nonexistent particle's surrounding world becomes more and more fantastic.
⌬Smaller...
: Just zooming in few times from the maximum influential radius of Nonexistent particle reveals a faint, blue cloud with
occasional
blue sparks
. The region is a result of particle's energy dropping to the minimum allowed for any particle inside
the influence
of physics
.
This means a particle's influential region cannot be smaller than this unless it is some weird one or "really" nonexistence. However, with energy
smaller than
anything else
, particles can do amazing things. Every time scale of space becomes small, it also becomes more fragile. Which can easily be carved by particles like Nonexistent particles, producing
awesom
eness
.
⌬Smaller...
: Not much difference at the scale where nonexistent particles' energy creates the first variant. In addition to blue sparkles, many different color variants appear. They are creations of more fragile space fluctuating with higher energy. Fluctuations can have a similar effect to
pho
tons
, producing situations that photons can also make.
⌬Smaller...
: Zooming in more to
smaller
sizes
adds more colors to the
fuzzy
clouds
. Clouds and sparks significantly get brighter at this size, resembling conditions of verse similar to our
univ
erse
. Along with instant sparks,
a stea
dy glow
emerges. The glow stays around for some time before radiating entirely into faint sparks.
⌬Smaller...
: Environments get many more properties than common verses may have. Such as attraction spots, holes of extreme properties floating around. They VERY slowly radiate into sparks. Or how about
occasional explosions sending
out clouds and sparks
so massive (relative to environment size), that they create borders containing various arrangements of sparks and objects? Really similar to verses, aren't they?
⌬Smal
ler...
: A lot more zoom-in reveals objects, clouds, and sparkles condensing more and more... until they stop doing it as they
meet a
border
. Inside of it is
pitch bla
ck space
. Going further into it reveals... nothing. Absolutely nothing... not even NOKIA 3310...
⌬Smaller...
: ... ... ... NaH, that's not the end!! zoom zoom zoom more to
ridiculously
tiny scale
and you see
almost-sol
id borders
chaining deep down to nothingness. Like barrels, the level of nothingness increases every time you go into deeper borders. Then,
other sorts
of borders
appear, until the chain ends.
⌬Smaller...
: Environments at this scale show off
fantastic variations
of everything
. Every single speck of space is enriched with an insane diversity of objects showing off all their beauty. You can go inside those
obj
ects
to escape from the space of Nonexistent particles, although reality inside them would be a completely unfamiliar reality and you would not be able to go back to the original one.
⌬Smaller...
: Ultimately, zooming in more
[
4
]
will only cause environments to get extremely alien, density slowly decreasing, and show unending darkness below the ceiling made of literally everything. once you enter this region, no method can get you back. If you managed to travel without arriving anywhere, for an immeasurable amount of time, you will, eventually, reach the center of the nonexistent particle. Zooming more is an unchanging impossibility, and who knows. Something amazing might have been hidden inside it. Too unlucky that it is forever hidden from everything...

As described above, we can show that nonexistent particles are, actually, wormholes between "
reali
ties
". As we zoom further, we would actually advance ahead through the
hiera
rchy
. Some nonexistent particles can lead into the abnormal wonders of "realities," in which those have different systems of sizing, like negative sizes.
In conclusion, nonexistent particles are infinitesimal wormholes between
omnip
ockets
.
