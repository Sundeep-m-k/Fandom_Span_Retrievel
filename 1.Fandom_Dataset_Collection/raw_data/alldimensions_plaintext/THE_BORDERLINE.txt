BORDERLINES
are structures containing
furtherlands
. Even though you wont get literally targetted by a sentient verse unlike what happens in the formers, BORDERLINES are messes almost as chaotic as a
virvis
, being unable to have life outside of their local furtherlands.
One of the reasons this happens is because remains of furtherlands that destroyed themselves are spreaded through here, still conservating part of their mind and hatred for anything escaping them. Their voice can still be heard because of this. Certain remains can combine and become so powerful they can directly attack you even if you're no longer inside a furtherland, becoming stronger than their original forms. These are known as "undead furtherlands".
Of course each BORDERLINE has a different amount of furtherlands, so some can be affected more by undead furtherlands than others, though its not the only dangerous factor of them. Like already mentioned before, BORDERLINES themselves are chaotic. Each
protoverse
they have is instead a protoverse-sized structure similar to an
inaccessibleverse
, meaning things are extremly glitched and non-fuctional.
Formation
[
]
Some BORDERLINES are formed due to the accumulation of furtherland's remains, but due to how big they are the consciences of the different furtherlands twist and stop working, meaning most BORDERLINES cant be sentient unlike the structures they contain. There are rare instances of BORDERLINES having such organized consciences though, which causes them to become undead BORDERLINES. Their behavior is similar to a furtherland, being extremly hostile to any living thing.
The reason their protoverses are distorted is unknown.
