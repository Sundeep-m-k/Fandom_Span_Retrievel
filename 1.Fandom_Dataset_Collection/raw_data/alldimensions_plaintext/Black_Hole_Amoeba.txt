General Info
[
]
Cosmic travel
[
]
They can traverse through
black holes
without any damage dealt on their body.
They also can take advantage of
wormholes
in order to transport themselves to other locations quicker.
Behavior
[
]
Black Hole Amoebas are passive most of the time, but they get hostile if they feel threatened or are starving.
Combat abilities
[
]
Black Hole Amoebas can ram themselves into ships if they are threatened, being capable of destroying even the most shielded ones with no trouble.
That's not even their most dangerous ability, though, as they can also produce sounds of up to 300 GHz, which can destroy ships,
planets
and even
stars
with ease. Larger individuals can even threaten entire
solar systems
with this ability.
They can also cause havoc just by their prescence, since they're so heavy they can produce powerful gravitational fields, making them somewhat similar to black holes.
Trivia
[
]
Their density is extremly high, because despite average Black Hole Amoebas being considerably smaller than
Earth
, they're far heavier than it.
Earth's weight: ~5.972 septillion kilograms (5.972 × 10
24
kg); average Black Hole Amoeba's weight: 15.02 undecillion kilograms (1.502 × 10
37
)
This also explains why they generate such dangerous gravitational fields.
