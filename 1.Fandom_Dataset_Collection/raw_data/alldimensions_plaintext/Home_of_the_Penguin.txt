This home is an isolated house that is located within the vast lands of the Antarctic Planet, mainly around the equator.
Being this far away from most of civilization, it offers its own barrier of protection and safety from potential dangers around the planet, although it does have its own encounters from time to time.
It's made out of wood, glass, and some stone found around the warmer areas of the planet. The house is kept warm through a fire, as seen from the chimney, as well as a furnace for underground work as well.
It has a basement in which the Penguin handles personal work, as well as intrinsically complex devices that allow the Penguin to contact anyone on the planet, as well as other beings across the Isolationist Universe. On some occasions, the devices are able to pick up other dieties and powerful beings from other universes, as they are strong enough to cross through.
Unlike ordinary houses, this house is mainly powered through geothermal processes that it has complete access to, a trait that other Antarctic houses have in this world, as well as internet access. Though difficult, it is possible to visit this home, as long as the entity in mind has either a natural or artificial heating suit to keep them warm.
On occasions, many of Antarctic Planet's inhabitants have found sactuary in this house, as well as occasional visitors who were most likely lost. The Penguin has been known to kick down the door at times, which he soon fixed after a while. Although very miniscule in comparison to other houses in the dimensional space, it serves a purpose, partly similar to the other homes.
