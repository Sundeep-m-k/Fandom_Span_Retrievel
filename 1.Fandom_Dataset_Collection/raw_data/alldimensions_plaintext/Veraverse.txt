Structure
[
]
Veraverses have three different forms; The Rhombiveras, the Spheriveras, and the Glitchiveras.
Rhombiveras
[
]
The Rhombiveras are the most common type of Veraverse. The Rhombiveras have a pretty standard structure, having groups of Thyluzhins floating around. Rarely, a Rhombivera will have a "Kilothyluzhin" which is a Thyluzhin that has been overfed with energy after Thyluzhin collisions. This happens due to a slight difference in temperature of the Rhombivera. The Rhombiveras are the most stable of the three forms, having a destruction chance from the inside(not from other Veraverses) of 1 in 1.6 googolcentiplex. The reason for this is that there are not many unstable Thyluzhins, which is the cause of most Veraversal deaths.
