Types of Cosmic Cannons
[
]
As a Cosmic Cannon can fire many different things, there are many different varieties/types of them.
Regular Cosmic Cannon
[
]
Regular Cosmic Cannons fire a massive, usually solid projectile at its target. These Cosmic Cannons are the most common, although they are considered the weakest. Regular Cosmic Cannons have an average reload time and damage, being able to obliterate a
Megaverse
in one hit.
Liquid Cosmic Cannons
[
]
Liquid Cosmic Cannons are Cosmic Cannons which fire liquid at their targets. Liquid Cosmic Cannons are very complicated, as liquid will drift apart in space due to the absence of gravity. Due to this, a Liquid Cosmic Cannon has to somehow make its liquid projectiles have sufficient gravity to hold together a 600 billion LY wide collection of particles, which is extremely hard.
Liquid Cosmic Cannons can push verses very far, although they do not do much damage and take a long time to reload.
Glitchonicite Cosmic Cannons
[
]
Glitchonicite Cosmic Cannons are Cosmic Cannons which fire
Glitchonicite
, one of the glitchiest substances in all of cosmology. Due to how Glitchonicite can corrupt and destroy all materials it comes into contact with, the Glitchonicite must be suspended away from any material for the Cosmic Cannon to fire.
Glitchonicite Cosmic Cannons have the 2nd longest reload time but do huge amounts of damage to a verse, with a 3 trillion LY wide one being able to almost completely destroy a Teraverse.
Projectileverse Cosmic Cannons
[
]
Projectileverse Cosmic Cannons are Cosmic Cannons which fire
Projectileverses
. Projectileverse Cosmic Cannons, as they fire Projectileverses, are usually smaller and have a slower base firing speed (since Projectileverses are lighter and easier to shoot from a cannon). Projectileverse Cosmic Cannons do not do much damage, but they have the fastest reload time.
Trivia
[
]
Cosmic Cannons used to known as Cosmos Cannons, but it got changed after a civilization got confused over the name and spread their version of the name (Cosmic Cannon) to the rest of their local
Asimagoymaverse
.
Cosmic Cannons are very ancient, with the oldest known Cosmic Cannon being created in -405,213,492
OYC
.
Glitchonicite Cosmic Cannons used to use
Toxicium
instead of Glitchonicite. This resulted in many malfunctions and deaths before it was changed to Glitchoncite.
