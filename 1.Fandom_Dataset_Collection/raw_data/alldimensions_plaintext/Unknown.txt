Some undiscovered integer, so large, that, pataphysically speaking, the sheer proportions of it have not been discovered. As it is coined "unknown".
Diameter
Same as above.
The Unknown
is a verse that has a size so large only purple light has escaped in the infinite amount of time it had been existent.
Wait another infinity years and this ball will be white. Wait more, and its possible that there will be a new color.
The Unknown
contains anything that is known or "unknown" which means that, technically speaking, contains things larger than it. Technically speaking, however, they all grow larger than each other, because of the way they work.
In the center lies the
Junkverse
and the
Poorly Misplaced Junkverse
. These two alone don't produce any visible light,
but the interfering forces cause an extremely bright light to appear at a very far distance
. From the inside, this light is invisible, it only becomes apparent when the observer travels to a distance akin to the diameter of the Unknown.
The reason for the pink tint of the light is still unknown.
Interesting fact: This contains an unimaginably more direct portal to
The White Plain
, a class-18 thing (Contains
