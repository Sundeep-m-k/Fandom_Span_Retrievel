The Edge
Scale
Size
No variables that measure size or kardashev scale matter, because size, even if it's "INFINITY^OMEGA^^^^^^EXPAN^^^EXPAN
^INFINITE(INFINITE(INFINITE))" would mean nothing to the scale of
The Edge
. The kardashev scale does not matter because it's constantly fluctuating due to new verses on AD wiki constantly being created, each with unique kardashev numbers. We can just say, that
The Edge
is just the servers that contain

Position
Contained by:
If this were to be contained by [A], this wouldn't be called the edge anymore. You could add an infinite amount of verses "beyond"
The Edge
, but it won't be called the edge anymore. Beyond those infinite amount of verses is
The Edge
. Anyways, since nothing contains [A], what contains [A] is
The Edge
. Even if [A] is then contained by [B], in which [B] existed before [A]'s creation, [B] would be contained by many verses, until you reach [C]. [C] is the edge of the chain, which results in two outcomes:
It is contained by a verse that existed before [C], creating either a finite or infinite loop
[berry paradox]
. If it's finite, it ends with [D], which currently isn't contained by anything, which means [D] is contained by
The Edge
.
It isn't contained by anything, which means it's contained by
The Edge
.
Contains:
Everything, regardless of any variable.
