Origin
Introduction
[
]
A Mature Blastoid.
Blastoids
are a
type
of
echinoderm
aka starfish/sea-urchin-type-
things
. They are found only in the
TREEverses
.
Life Cycle:
[
]
Larvae
[
]
A Blastoid begins its life as a larvae from one of the explosive fruits. It stays like that for 2 years, eating things like ants and eggs, and it also can ride the wind via the use of wings.
Sprouting
[
]
After 2 years, the larvae has gathered enough food to dig into the soil and sprout. From then on Blastoids are just like
pale garden
trees in
Minecraft
almost their whole life.
Reproduction
[
]
After 4 years in this state, Blastoids will grow explosive acidic fruits that are filled with larvae and throw them around, destroying most of them but some always remain, along with lots of larvae.
They repeat this "fruit bombing" every 2 years while growing tubers underground which they use as energy stores.
Death
[
]
Blastoids can live up to 100 years, after which they die from old age.
Uses:
[
]
Blastoid wood.
Blastoid cyan "wood" or stem is a highly valuable
material
for it's rarity and strength of the "wood". It's orange acid fruits are highly poisonous to plants but cause no harm to animals, although they are so acidic they can dissolve metal and it is a catalyst, meaning it isn't used up in the process, hence it's popular use as a weed killer and a substance used in the process to reuse metal. Blastoid tubers are eaten as a local staple food in the TREEverse.
Origin
[
]
This is an ancient Blastoid.
Blastoids originated on earth in the
Cambrian period
. At that time they were just like ancient sea urchins stuck to an extremely short stalk of bone-like material that attached them to the sea floor and mainly fed on plankton with their jawless mouths. They became extremely diverse after that, but seem to have disappeared at the end of the Permian.
The truth was that an unknown alien species (probably extinct already) saw their potential and took them to a lone planet in a TREEverse. From then on, they slowly evolved into the tree-type beings we see today.
