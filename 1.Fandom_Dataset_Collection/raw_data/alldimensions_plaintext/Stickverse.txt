The Stickverse is a cylindrical, thin verse which is
coated with a very sticky substance which acts as a very strong glue
. Any verse which comes into contact with the Stickverse will be
stuck onto it for all eternity
unless the part which is stuck is cut off from the verse.
The sticky coating covering the Stickverse is a very strange substance. The green, slightly transparent substance has been found to be
very hard to get rid of, as it will simply stick onto whatever material it comes into contact with, including gases, liquids, solids, or even plasma
.
The Stickverse
moves very fast, and will increase its speed exponentially when any verse is stuck onto it
. The Stickverse's speed does not seem to obey the laws of a verse it is in, allowing it to increase its speed forever. The Stickverse is currently traveling at an insane speed of 461,423,081 LY per second.
The Stickverse will, from time to time eject a little of its sticky coating at speeds enough to puncture a hole through a verse's barrier.
Multiple attempts to slow down the Stickverse by attaching rockets,
Stealbots
, and fast-moving verses to pull the Stickverse the other way have failed, with the Stickverse moving even faster than before due to its property.
