The
White Pentagonal Hexecontahedron
is a verse that contains a very large cloud of
Pentagonal Hexacontahedrons
. It is known because one of its faces is missing, allowing for a relatively easy escape, if you can travel fast enough.
Because there are so many Pentagonal Hexacontahedrons in The White Pentagonal Hexacontahedron, they sometimes collide, spewing extreme amounts of light, information, and other things everywhere. This is still very rare, though, so it has not been studied very well.
Composition
[
]
As previously mentioned, The White Pentagonal Hexecontahedron contains Pentagonal Hexecontahedrons and a hole. It also has a surface, which cannot be broken and is not actually a surface, it just reverses photons, giving the illusion of a surface.
The hole
[
]
The hole of The White Pentagonal Hexacontahedron is the only face of the object that allows photons through. However, this is the only face that it does not allow all other kinds of matter through, so you must travel through any other face to be able to cross. Because of this, when passing through The White Pentagonal Hexacontahedron, you will be blind for multiple seconds as you travel past it. This caused panic originally as people passed through it.
