Uywihug was an extremely powerful entity that ruled over vast parts of
The Nested Infinity
. It got destroyed by
The Seeker
, because Uywihug was getting too much power.
Uywihug was created from a huge collection of Omniverses of Reality by previous Panomni-gods. The Panomni-gods were desperate to keep their Nested Infinity under control, since there were Omni-Gods that didn't follow the them, and were casuing havoc everywhere. When Uywihug was created, it immediately subdued every single rebellion and Omni-God and destroyed all of them. It later destroyed most of the other Panomni-gods in the Nested Infinity. Uywihug became a sort of "tyrant" and controlled every single verse, reality, and even void in the entire
Nested Infinity
.
That caused The Seeker to destroy Uywihug. The Nested Infinity was slowly rebuilt afterwards.
