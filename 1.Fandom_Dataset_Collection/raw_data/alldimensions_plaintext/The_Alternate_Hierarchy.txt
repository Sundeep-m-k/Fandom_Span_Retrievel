Preface
[
]
This hierarchy is based on the Official Hierarchy, but certain details and orders been changed. In my eyes, this helps the hierarchal order be more cohesive. There will be some entries that do not have a page, and a lot of it (and the lore) has been created by me. If you have any specific suggestions feel free to comment!
Each entry will have two values - its size and its
OL
(Ordinal Level). An Ordinal Level is a bit like the Soupcount (V&D Wiki) or EUSI. Unlike AO, its a bit more straightforward in that an OL of ω usually means it contains ω verses. Like ordinals, for infinite verses, an ordinal will be the limit of its fundamental sequence, so a ω × ω verse will contain the ω verse (
Omniverse
), the ω × 2 verse (Diplomniverse), the ω × 3 verse (Veromniverse) ... all the way for every Omni layer. And as such the
Barrel
has an OL of ω × ω. And finally, some size values may be modified to make sure containment makes sense. If this happens, you will see
Size Modified
next to the entry.
Each entry will have a short description below it. I might add sub-entries like groups and
Shirroverses
but I am lazy. A red
YGTP
next to an entry indicates it precedes an infinite set of verses, but the pattern should be obvious, hence,
Y
ou
G
et
T
he
P
oint. Finally, if an entry is
blue
, it does not have an official page. I have created it for this hierarchy
