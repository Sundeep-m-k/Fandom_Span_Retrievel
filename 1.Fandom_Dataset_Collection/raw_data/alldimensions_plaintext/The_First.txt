This, this is the true middle ground. It is considered to be a "medium" size compared to everything. This, thing, is a pillar monument who carves itself with an ancient language documenting EVERYTHING thats happening, This pillar is big enough to exactly time when things stop...Changing. When all stars die and become black holes, when no more stars are birthed no more galaxies exist and no more verses and realms stay in one piece. That, is when this pillar stops carving and documenting. It is called The First, however it likes to be called Pillar One. Yes, this thing is sentient. Further studying have shown the pillar is made out of the same stuff as
The Great Big
is, whenever the time left for the world, aka everything, to die changes, the pillar's size changes as well. Pillar One even predicted when a star goes supernova. Its purpose is unknown and we don't know if it's good or bad, but we know it existed since the beginning.
