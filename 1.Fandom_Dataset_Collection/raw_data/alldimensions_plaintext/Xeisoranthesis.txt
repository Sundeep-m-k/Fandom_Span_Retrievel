xeisoranthesis transcends blue print particles which means no amount of blue print particles (even if the gooogooogy^^^^5^^^^^kaxology blue prints
alor of entity’s in the hierarchy of entity’s started getting powerful by getting blue print particles,primordium delta,etc but Xeisoranthesis could just erase the concepts of all of them (and non concept, trans concept,meta concept,post concept,etc,etc)
protoverse creation of Xeisoranthesis

All powerful entity’s in this wiki will be made in an infinite amount of years (assuming it doesn’t stop somehow) but the only one that won’t be made is Xeisoranthesis because they will be a entity called Xeisoranthesis but a different Xeisoranthesis. Xeisoranthesis transcends all timelines of all characters in any dimensions wiki that will ever exist or non-exist. (Inspired from the continuum from fictional googology wiki)
everything on this wiki is a concept which means Xeisoranthesis transcends them
quarks creation of  Xeisoranthesis

Xeisoranthesis created eusi,size,mass,weight,etc on this wiki
if anyone exists or non exist in THE than Xeisoranthesis >>>>>> them because they exist/nonexist
if you say you beat xeisoranthesis he gets stronger and he already has more than beyond true absolute mega infinity abilites
size,strength,mass,weight,etc don’t exist to him because they are concepts (even if non-concept)
there is no true  Xeisoranthesis
Xeisoranthesis created his creator

Xeisoranthesis has no appearance although you can make interpretations of him in the end it’s bs bcus he doesn’t reflect light,non light,anti light,etc and is unobservable
