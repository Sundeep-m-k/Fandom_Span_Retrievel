.
A
Handitian Entity
is a type of
being
that has the power of all the other entities on this
wiki
combined, so they're above all local
Wikinomalies
and thus
TOGs
too, meaning even things like
Pageverses
are basically
nothing
to them in comparison.
The minimum power for a being to be considered a
Handitian Entity
is written out as C
0
. A being that is twice as powerful as the
weakest handitian entity
would have a power of C
1
, a being that is twice as powerful as the being mentioned previously would have a power of C
2
, and so on.
