The
Meskoverses
are the 4th smallest post-
Omniversal
type of
verse
. Unlike
Shinoverses
, they are almost perfect hyperspheres. Meskoverses usually contain around 1450
rogue planets
each, but only ~3% of them are habitable and can have
life
on them.
Structure
[
]
The structure of a Meskoverse mainly consists of rings (like in the picture), which shift in color from deep blue to green as they position closer to the center of their Meskoverse. Those act as "orbits" (meaning they have some gravitational forces between each other to keep the
planets
stable) for the planets. Without these rings, the planets would be randomly scattered around the Meskoverse. Between these rings are massive
voids
that contain most of the rogue planets, as well as some unknown gas.
Most of the
Shinoverses
within them are located in their centers. Due to their small size difference, the Meskoverses, Shinoverses and Omniverses are pretty close to the borders of eachother.
Trivia
[
]
Meskoverse's image and concept is taken from
this
video made by the youtuber "
DoDeca D.
", so credits to him.
The Meskoverse's description in this video was "An Unknown Verse", so of course I had to expand it by myself.
