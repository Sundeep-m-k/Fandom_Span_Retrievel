Unlike other
OAVs
, TDUOAV has effectively the same size as
TUOAV
. It’s not really a real part of the
OAV Chain
, but it exists as two copies of
TUOAV
. The copies are symmetrical, there is nothing different about them, except that the other copy cannot interact with us, and neither can we. Photons, matter, nothing from our
TUOAV
can interact with the second one. However, they seem to interact with the higher verses, like
TIOAV
just fine.
Interestingly, not even the highest or most omniscient entities have found a way to interact with, measure, or convert with Dual Matter. It is assumed impossible. As well as this, Hyperphotons and anything that can exist within
TUOAV
cannot interact with the other half of TDUOAV. That means that Hyperphotons cannot interact with them, in fact, Xenophotons are the only way to interact with them, and as such, TDUOAV wasn’t discovered until
TTOAV
had been discovered and we were able to condense light into such an extreme form.
Xenophotons
[
]
Here’s a quick primer on what Xenophotons are:
Xenophotons are infinitely fast, transparent entities that can transcend all reality breaks. The only thing that can slow them enough to even be measured is the extreme density of a
TTOAV
, and in fact, due to their extreme-density nature, they can only exist for 2-3
Voidseconds
when they are not in a
TTOAV
.
