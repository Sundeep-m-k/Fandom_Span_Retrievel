A
Hencentroverse
is a verse that contains
Toriverses
. They are mostly contained of
forustar
giants, with a small amount forming
toriverses
. The others radiate
moquarks
, but because these aren't inside a toriverse, they just fly around inside the Hencentroverse.
Rare events in Hencentroverse
[
]
Sometimes, two forustar giants collide, creating a forunova. These can make normal forustars, with huge amounts of moquarks colliding.
There's a very small chance that a toriverse will form in a spherical shape. Hencentroverses are also spherical, although their formation is currently unknown.
The edge of a Hencentroverse is made out of a super-hard material made of stacked and hypercompressed moquarks, however, a rare occurrence is having a hole inside one, likely formed by two Hencentroverses colliding.
