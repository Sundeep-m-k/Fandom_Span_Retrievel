The Continuum of Nothing is a void that expands for an infinity of infinity of infinity of infinity and so on FOREVER. It is the largest part of The Hierarchy of Everything and nothing is larger than it as we know of. It contains all of the things before it, the
Transcendentem Continuum
, the
Transcendentem
,
Beyond
and so on.
Creation
[
]
The Continuum of Nothing was created once the Transcendentem Continuum was formed. The dimensional ingredient
Krenchtium 3B
was able to make this possible to create the Continuum of Nothing.
Krenchtium 3B
[
]
Krenchtium 3B was discovered in 1963 when German physicist
Dr. Adelbert L. Krencht
found it while he was trying to make a black hole from scratch.
