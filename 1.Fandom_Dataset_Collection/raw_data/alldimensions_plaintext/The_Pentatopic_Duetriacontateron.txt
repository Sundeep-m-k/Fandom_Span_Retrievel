The
Pentatopic Duetriacontateron
is a type of
verse
shaped like an extremely complex polyteron (5D shape). Each copy contains a single
White Pentagonal Hexacontahedron
, and they're hard to escape.
Pentatopic Duetriacontaterons usually split into 4 portions, which are: edges, vertices, cells, and the center. The latter only contains the local White Pentagonal Hexacontahedron and nothing else, but the others are more interesting.

The Portions
[
]
Edges
[
]
The edges of the Pentatopic Duetriacontaterons are constructed from many
Absolute Cubes
, and each of them are connected to two vertices. This makes them very strong, even for the size standard of these verses.
Vertices
[
]
Constructed from
Primordium Alpha
, the vertices hold up the edges from collapsing, which would make the entire verse collapse.
Cells

This section is invisible and only contains
void
, so it also subsequently contains
Absolute Darks
.
