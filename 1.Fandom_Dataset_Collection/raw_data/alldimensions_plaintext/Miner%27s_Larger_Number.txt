Miner's Larger Number is the estimative of
1
â„œ
2
{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\Re ^{2}}}}
of the size of the Omniverse (if number is in light milleniums)
The number's formula is:
M
l
1
=
M
120
{\displaystyle Ml_{1}=M_{120}}
M
l
2
=
M
M
120
{\displaystyle Ml_{2}=M_{M_{120}}}
M

=

{\displaystyle Ml_{3}=M_{M_{M_{120}}}}
...
