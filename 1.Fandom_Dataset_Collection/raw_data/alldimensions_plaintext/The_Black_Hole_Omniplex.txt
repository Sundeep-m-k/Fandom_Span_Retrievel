The "realm"
[
]
The Black Hole Omniplex contains a subatomic realm within itself as well as the two other black holes, which about one in every ~2,000 atoms entering the BHO manage to get to. Using countless disposable subatomic cameras, it was discovered that there is actually life there, which have been named
Bholites
, after the Black Hole Omniplex's abbreviation, BHO. There is no discovered way to exit this realm.
