(aka, a butt load of prefixes)
(by POYO12469)
first lets define the prefix, MolkoweSaio.
define the prefix Molkowe, which means
f'
f'
x
(ͳ)
(x) defining ͳ as the biggest ordinal defineable using
Mandore's ordinal trees
using no more than x layers of branches, each branch having no more than x branches.
define the presuffix (or a suffix to a prefix) Saio as repeating the prefix behind it X times
next, lets define a lightgalacticmillenium
a light-(insert unit of time here) = the amount of space light travels in 1 (insert unit of time here).
a millenium (some times called a kiloyear) is equal to 1,000 years
if a galactic year is equal to 250,000,000 terrestrial years, than a galacticmillenium is equal to 250,000,000,000 terrestrial years.
so
boom!!
there you have it! a MolkoweSaiolightgalacticmillenium! i hope you liked my first page on this wiki. it was real fun making this.
