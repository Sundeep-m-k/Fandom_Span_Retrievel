A
Toriverse
is a verse that is shaped like a
torus
. Inside of it, the second law of entropy applies, which is defined as:
Shapes with the least number of sides have the least entropy.
This means that all things inside of a toriverse try to have 1 side. However, outside the toriverse, this rule does not apply, and so things are allowed to have more than 1 side.
Notable objects in toriverses
[
]
Toriverses have one hole in them, which holds one forustar giant. The inside of toriverses contain normal
forustars
, which are a type of star.
There are also foruholes, which are vital in the formation of
Kleinverses
.
Relation to moquarks
[
]
The material that the edge of toriverses are made of are gigantic amounts of
moquarks
tiled together, which fall of and form
Möbiverses
. It was speculated that Toriverses would slowly shrink until it was found that forustar giants emit moquarks indefinitely, so toriverses are just one byproduct of forustar giants existing.
