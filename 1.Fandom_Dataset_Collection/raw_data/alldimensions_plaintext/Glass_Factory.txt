A Glass Factory is a factory of very large size that produces
Glasscosmoses
and
Glassverses
. These factories is ran by the same gods that ran the
Plastic Factory
. No sand or furnaces are used in its glass production process, instead, these factories have many little copies of
Dokaverses
inside to harvest lots of
Glass Particles
from it, and the factory will automatically turn googols of particles to a done
Glasscosmoses
or
Glassverses
.
This factory is very young compared to other factories, it was created around 17 OYC ago, while others (like
Barrel Factory
) was created 2500 to 40000 OYC ago.
