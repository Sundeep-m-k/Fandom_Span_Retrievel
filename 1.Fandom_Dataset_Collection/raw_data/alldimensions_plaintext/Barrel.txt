The Barrel
is not a
Box
, rather it is a concept that links the subsections of nothingness in them
[
1
]
. Each barrel in the Barrel series is hardly accessible from the last. Notice that all of a Box contains recursive functions of itself, so to go outside of it, it needs to be inaccessible to the inside of the
Omniverses
. That's how the size is determined.
Every Barrel has its own "Barrel Index". Barrels almost certainly form chains above themselves, which are kind of hard to distinguish without a special classifier, and that classifier is the Barrel Index as explained below. The index is based on a "nothingness level", and works for pretty much every Barrel of every Box
[
2
]
.
Barrel Index
[
]
The Barrel Index n denotes "freedom of nothingness"
[
3
]
, where Barrel-0 is an
Outside
, and Barrel-(n+1) has a noticeable increase in freedom compared to Barrel-n which it contains. The biggest n value possible is chosen, and only
structures
that don't exist and are directly/indirectly contained by a Box count.
If a Barrel doesn't directly or indirectly contain the main Outsides, then it is instead compared relative to similar freedom-wise structures in the main Barrel hierarchy. If a structure is somehow less free than an Outside or more free than a Box, then it doesn't have a Barrel Index
[
4
]
.
The Barrels are Barrel-1, the
Barrelplexes
are Barrel-2, etc.
Layers of The Barrel
[
]
Layer ∅: Layer ∅ is pre-nothing structures, like the Omniverses and other structures. It is defined as "layer null", due to the fact that it isn't nothing, so can't really be assigned a numerical value. This means that finite
verses
are almost always at Layer ∅.
Layer 0: Layer 0 is nothingness, but not the Barrel yet. This area is known as the Outsides. This layer is the base of all Barrel chains, since without it, a Barrel chain is not a Barrel chain anymore.
Layer 1: Layer 1 is where a Barrel starts, and is very loosely connected with the other layers. There appear to be tons of "invisible walls" here, but they turn out to be gaps in nothingness, the container of things, that Layer 1 hasn't covered. The invisible walls get worse until the end of Layer 1, where entities that can't change existence state will get trapped. Changing existence state is very hard due to the tiny size of a
xoꓭ
, but exposure to the "invisible walls" helps a tiny bit due to the fact that skipping over holes in space can break some objects.
Entities
that escape Layer 1 are pretty lucky.
Layer 2: Nothingness returns, but as little orbs scattered throughout this layer. These orbs each have a different density of nothingness, but it is evenly distributed throughout an orb. The total capacity of these orbs ranges from only containing a point to containing whole miniature Barrels, giving a fractal-like structure to them.
Sometimes, these fractals destroy nothingness that interacts with it due to fractional dimensionality converting normal dimensionality into undefined structures, causing huge explosions that branch out throughout dimensions and can even make the dimensionality of some objects negative, causing things like
this
to happen.
Layer 3: Space is extremely broken here. Most finite things cannot withstand more than 10 minutes of Layer 3 before they get stuck in a
Heaa
. They only get stuck in them as a failsafe; they would otherwise get vaporized due to broken space.
Layer 4+: These layers are just nested versions of Heaas and sub-Heaa structures, which ocassionally have mixes of other structures within them. This even goes all the way to
Blueprint Particles
at layer omega, causing a mess of a bunch of identical structures that are even identical in position due to duplicated information.  This makes the whole layer omega just seem like a portal to a singularity that you can't escape, similar to a black hole. Your information is also slowly deleted until you dissolve into a Blueprint Particle as well, adding on to the "singularity".
Barrel Chains' locations
[
]
Beyond the Barrel, we might see bigger Barrels that lie in the Boxes. Since the nesting can be purely infinite, one can expect to find every possible form of barrels. Normally however, after infinite chaining of barrels, all chains of barrels terminate inside
Barrelverses
. Of course, not
every
chain of Barrels ends here, but they
[
5
]
are usually chained only 2 to 2
1000
layers outside barrelverse
[
6
]
.
↑
This means each different layer of barrels of barrel chain contains different kinds of nothingness. KINDS of nothingness?? What in the world, no, a Box is that?? The answer is simple. Look around you, and find an empty bottle. Now imagine comparing it to interstellar vacuum of space. You can call the bottle empty inside. However, it is much more plenty than interstellar vacuum. Great, you just differentiated basic concept of nothingness, by defining a lack of concept (water in the bottle) and a lack of one kind of matter (space vacuum, where there is
a
l
m
o
s
t
no visible matter).
↑
Except weird mutations of them such as
barrel full of memes
, full of plutonium, full of sharp pencil grenade, and ones full of barrel full of barrel full of barrel full of barrel full of ...
↑
can be described easily by "kinds of nothingness" described in 1st reference. Now, apply kinds of nothingness to everything, list them from fullest to emptiest 

such as:
E

{\displaystyle Empty\ bottle\rightarrow Space\ vacuum\rightarrow The\ outside}
if you have done this to infinite different types of nothingness, woohoo, you now have complete map of barrel chains' nothingness chain!! :D

yayyy...?

ahh yes... single lunatic barrel ruins everything below (possibly infinite).

Sure, the limit certainly seems big, but consider that it is tiny space-been scale compared to FREAKING INFINITY
