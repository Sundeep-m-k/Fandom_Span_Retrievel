Introduction
[
]
Outcode
- its like if pseudo physical limits existed. I mean, a concept that breaks concept 2
conceptual rank
verses. It means it is false and of base verses like a piece of code of a
wikiverse
. This is some kind of arena, with islands and a black sky with zeros and ones. And you jump around the islands trying not to fall into the abyss and fight.
Parts
[
]
Islands
[
]
Islands consisting of highly durable solid materials, which are scattered everywhere.
The Abyss
[
]
If you fall off the island into the abyss, then any creature will be erased.
Verses
[
]
Anti voids
- mini spheres which as soon as you touch them, they'll immediately suck you into them, being unlikely to come back.
There are also rogue
Voids
scattered across the Outcodes.
Terminal Terminals
- post alphasm version of basic terminal terminals with a creepy programer.
Cosmic entities found
[
]
Deep programmers
- If they see you, THEY'LL [[REDACTED]] YOU. Related to the post-alphasmic version of the Terminal Terminals.
Nightmare godity
- there are recorded instances of him appearing on our local Outcode to brawl.
Random entities across the whole local
wikiverse
are generated randomly, though none of them can be stronger than the Outcodes themselves.
