A
Brox
is a green, protective natural "shield" which surrounds a single
Box
each. A Brox contains not only integer
existence ranks
(which you might see from the Boxes), but also contain fractional ranks that go between those ranks. For example, our Brox contains
existence-0
,
existence-1
, and many in between.
The individual Box within a Brox are indirectly protected by weak FES ranks, in which those ranks sprout mysterious
Subexistion
particles
out that protect the Box from uncontrollable movements and expansions.

Thanks to the power of certain
civilizations
, Broxes can be turned on and off. Because said feature is only used in dire situations, it is always turned off though, until needed otherwise. A Brox is composed out of the objects from their contained Box and also an infinite amount of infinite-dimensional chaotic Perlin noise "structures" made with random objects, all of whom have differing existence ranks, ranging from 0 (non-existence) to 1 (existence), including the fractional ranks. These all get turned into 0 when their Brox is "turned off".
Relations to Boxes
[
]
By objects, the Broxes hold infinitely more objects than the Box they contain, but they could fit in a size that's finitely bigger, due to being infinite dimensional. All objects have relative positions in their Brox, unless it is infinitely smaller than the latter.
By size, most Broxes are ~2 times bigger than the Box they contain, and some can go up to trillions of times their size!
Formation
[
]
During the development of a Box the forces from existence-4 and 5 icosahedrons (described in the
Other Box
article) push fractional existence ranks out. Later, those ranks will become a shield for that Box. That's basically it.
Civilization
[
]
Conquered Broxes usually have a shield that push objects to random locations in the Box they contain. The only way to circumnavigate this is to think outside of the Box, or travel through some of its contained
Barrels
.
Another way is to climb up through an
Infinifold
, by going at a direction which you will traverse exponentially further. (
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
x per 1 m in that direction) However, traversing through transfinite positions is borderline impossible, due to being tetraradioactivity.

Weak Broxes
[
]
Weak Broxes only consists of strong FES ranks, down to eighths. The density is much lower than strong Broxes, making that escaping their contained Box a freebie. All Broxes start as weak ones, but they will dissolve quickly, except for really lucky Broxes, which later turned into strong Broxes.
Weak Broxes are much, much bigger than strong Broxes, having a size range of around 1 million - 1 trillion times bigger than an average Box.
Strong Broxes
[
]
Strong Broxes have much, much larger set of FES ranks, that includes a gigantic number of unique, weak FES ranks. Unlike the weak ones, they are empowered by Subexistion particles. Some could push you to a random location in their contained Box when trying to escape. That doesn't mean that you can escape said Box by going speeds faster than
ω
ω
{\displaystyle \omega^{\omega}}
mph, though.
Most Strong Broxes are barely 2x bigger than the average Box, but some can be either 5x, 10x, or even 100x bigger than the latter instead.
Brox degeneration
[
]
In a really far future, most if not all Broxes will degenerate into weak ones. The frequency for this event happening is 1 million
OYC
per degeneration.
During the degeneration, fractional existence ranks will lose their strength. Eventually, weak ones will burst, creating the unknown greenshift effect.
We don't know the reason why this anomaly happens. But we know mysterious
Subexistions
were the cause of this.
