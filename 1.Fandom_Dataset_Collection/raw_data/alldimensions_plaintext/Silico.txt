Silico
is a very boring and empty wasteland. It is twice the size of
in Silico
, but the interesting stuff is only inside in Silico. Although Silico has the same properties, Silico is basically nothing.
Silico does have some magnetic poles just like in Silico, but they don't even work properly and aren't the same like the ones on in Silico.
The appearance of Silico is the exact same as that of in Silico, the functionality is the same, the concept, idea, containments and everything is the same. Only in Silico is much more interesting than Silico.
