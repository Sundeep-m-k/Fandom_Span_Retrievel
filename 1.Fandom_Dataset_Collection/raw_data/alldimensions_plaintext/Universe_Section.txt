Universe Sections
are large regions found in some
Universes
where within the section the
laws
and values of constants of the Universe have a very slight and sudden change. The borders of a Universe Section do not move and there is no known way to destroy a Universe Section (other than destroying the Universe itself). Usually, a Universe Section's border is invisible unless the change in laws is large enough for visual changes to be seen.
Our Universe does not contain any Universe Sections, due to it being that every physical laws and constants are static throughout.
Relation to Universes
[
]
A typical Universe with Universe Sections in it will have 7 Universe Sections on average, but some Universes have been found with as little as 2 and as many as 36. The physical constants of the Universe are usually varied by extremely small but still measurable amounts, with less than a
1.5

%
{\displaystyle 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}\%}
deviation in any physical constant (on average). The speed of light is typically the most common constant to deviate, the reason for this is unknown.
Approximately 1 in 100,000 Universe Sections will have a significant enough change in laws that they will have larger-scale consequences, although this usually means that structures like
galaxies
are unable to form. These were the first Universe Sections to be discovered and are called Extreme Universe Sections or EUSes. Some EUSes can cause supernovas and black holes to become much more common, others may even cause solar systems to become unstable. One EUS was found that even caused atoms to be unstable.
Multiverses
[
]
So far, every known
Multiverse
has had at least one EUS. The reasons for this are unknown, as the chances of this happening for every single Multiverse are far too small for it to be a coincidence.
There are no known Multiverse Sections,
Metaverse
Sections, etc., despite detailed searches throughout the
Omniverse
since the discovery of EUSes.
