Fractaloverses are verses that are contained by
polyverses
. A defining feature of fractaloverses is their city-like structure at their center, called Mylantis. They also have many Oak Tree Planets (despite them not being
planets
in the strictest sense) that an observer can use Shrink Rings to enter. Every nook and cranny of Fractaloverses are filled with hostile entities like Kitrinoderms, Chromalefkoderms, Polymatians, and Coccinoderms (nicknamed Goblins, Marines, Menaces, and Overseers respectively).

Structures
[
]
Fractaloverses have many unique strctures that are found nowhere else. While some structures may be similar to places outside of Fractaloverses, they are not the same.
Mylantis
[
]
Mylantis is a city-like structure containing many weapons to fight the far greater amount of entities in the fractaloverse. This includes rockets, lasers, etc. There is only one of this structure per fractaloverse.
Oak Tree Planets
[
]
Oak tree planets are large, cubical objects with "grass" at their top and "dirt" at the middle and bottom. It is here you will find many entities and other structures, like Petite Goons, Oak Trees, Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee airbases, yellow cubes, etc. It is often dangerous to shrink too far into this structure, as enemy bullets can kill you.
Ying Flowers
[
]
Ying flowers are flower-like structures inside oak tree planets. These flowers have 4 Ying Shells that contain a Ying World. Ying worlds contain ying islands, some having White Flowers which have many enemies to kill before getting armor to protect you from entities like the one you had to kill. On the ying islands, there are Ying Forests. These have many structures, like grey cubes which have smaller ying forests inside, always having more grey cubes with more ying forests, and have a lot of weapons to defend yourself against the entities.
Yellow Flowers
[
]
Yellow flowers are other flower-like structures that have a dungeon, that when completed, give you a plasma-like weapon. They are found in ying forests. There are tower-like structures in the treasure room of a yellow flower called Pyramid Farms. These have 3 pyramids, which have a maze and another treasure room at the end.
Pyramids
[
]
Pyramids are orange structures that have a maze full of goblins and a treasure room with many weapons, like a cannon weapon. They also may contain another Yellow Flower, causing a fractal-like experience. This is why Fractaloverses are called that.
Formation
[
]
Fractaloverses form from small gas clouds called polynebulas. These gas clouds collapse into a single point, expand for a few seconds, and stay at their current size until they collide with another Fractaloverse or get ejected from their home
polyverse
.
Collisions
[
]
Fractaloverse collisions are rare. This is because at most, they only move at a distance equivalent to their radii every second. In this event, the Mylantis of one of the former fractaloverses is destroyed.
Slow
[
]
These are collisions where both Fractaloverses are moving at 0.01 - 0.1 R_{f} (fractaloverse radii). At most, 10 - 15 entities are ejected. As for the fractaloverses, they only slowly merge, though some oak tree planets may collide.
Medium
[
]
Collisions at 0.1 - 0.5 R_{f} are medium-speed. In this collision, the fractaloverses explode, though it is only around half the energy of the explosion when a fractaloverse gets ejected out of it's home polyverse.
Fast
[
]
At 0.5 to 1 R_{f}, it is considered fast. An explosion 8 times more energetic than when a fractaloverse gets ejected happens, killing all entities inside. All the oak tree planets, ying flowers, yellow flowers, gone. These were mistaken for extremely violent stellar flares.
