The Legoverse is a very, very large
verse
consisting of only bricks. Most of them float around, some even exceeding the speed of light, and only interact with each other very sparingly. Some form Legosgiants, which are similar to gas giants, but are made out of transparent bricks. These can form Legolaxies. Because Legosgiants happen to only form when bricks collide with each other in a certain way that causes them to snap, Legosgiants are extremely rare. Usually, you can only find these every 10
100!
light years.
The size of the Legoverse is beyond unfathomable. If the size of absolute infinity light years were scaled down to the reciprocal of itself, the Legoverse would still be the size of an absolute infinite light years in our normal realities size system. The Legoverse is contained by the Leggomylegoverse, which exceeds the size of the Legoverse. The Legoverse doesn't contain any verses, however wormholes to other verses may appear. They, of course, are made out of bricks.
Though the Legoverse is this large, it doesn't have many dimensions. Anything inside the Legoverse will become compressed into three dimensions, and it's particles will start to take the shape of bricks.
Life
[
]
Living in the Legoverse is very inconvenient. The material that planets are made up of aren't radioactive, but the bricks are shaped in ways designed to immediately stun, shock, and decapitate anybody who steps on them. As such, most life have evolved wings or a method of flight that allows them to escape from the grasp of the bricks. When species come around that cannot fly, mass extinction is soon sure to come.
Since the size of the Legoverse exceeds absolute infinity, there are many infinities of chance for life to thrive. Even though your chances of finding a species of life is nearly zero, there are infinity species that exist in the Legoverse. Most of these are gargantuan monstrosities with DNA formed from different shades of bricks. They practically all have abilities of flight. There is one exception, though.
Legoverseland and Goonlings
[
]
Legoverseland is the name of a very unique Legosgiant that can be found in the KjeldKirkKristiansen Legolaxy. All of the bricks on this planet are inside-out, meaning that the bricks are somewhat safe to stand on. The slips through the cracks kill many Legoduplomites, very tiny creatures resembling blocky bacteria, every voidsecond. Very powerful and rare Goonlings live on this planet. Goonlings can conjure items and manipulate magic, and they developed an object to prevent them from perishing to bricks. They call it the Goodwillbin, and it fills up with hundreds of brick-resistant shoes every day. Many Goonlings die because they accidently pick shoes with holes in them, though.
The leader of the Goonlings is known as the Royaling.
Bricklings
[
]
Bricklings live on the
atmosphere
of LV-588Y, a planet that orbits around the KjeldKirkKristiansen Legolaxy, but isn't close enough to be considered part of it. The atmosphere of LV-588Y is thick with thin, semi-transparent bricks known as Legases. Bricklings can actually grab onto the bottom of the Legases without dying to the deadly top-portion of the bricks. Bricklings evolved to this, eventually having a magnetic pull to certain legases that can save them from the deadly surface. Bricklings have learned to manipulate their magnetic pull, allowing for better aim, better dodging, and additional advantages. Unfortunately, other species can manipulate this ability for their own good. If a deadly Legas is thrown at a Brickling, the Brickling will be pulled towards the deadly Legas.
The leader of the Bricklings is known as the Bricking. It is pronounced as BRIC-king.
Bricklings and Goonlings have a harsh rivalry. They both want to eliminate each other through the use of bricks, Legases, and gadgets, such as the Goodwillbin. Bricklings are much more endangered due to their inability to come in contact with the tops of bricks at all. Goonlings are also much more powerful in terms of strengths and abilities. So far, Goonlings seem to be the most likely victor.
Barrier
[
]
The
barrier
of the Legoverse is very different on the inside than the outside. The outside of the Legoverse looks like a small collection of bland, beige bricks, while the inside contains a vast quantity of seemingly endless varieties of shades of bricks. Some of these shades aren't visible to the human eye, because they fall off of the known spectrum of colors. Bricklings, Goonlings, and most species can see above 99.9% of these colors, but a few shades of colors remain a mystery.
The barrier of the Legoverse can be split into two different sections: Outer, and Inner. The inner barrier is a moderately strong barrier containing a single layer of bricks. These bricks are very strong, and one of them is enough to resist a
Sproyong
or most of a supernovae. Yet, there is only one layer of bricks, so the Legoverse's Inner layer is quite weak. The Outer layer of the barrier is extremely tough, as the barrier consists of those very same bricks, scaled up to the size of many
Omniverses
.
Getting Into the Legoverse
[
]
Getting through the barrier of the Legoverse can be very difficult, so there are alternative methods. Wormholes that directly lead to the Legoverse are somewhat common as the Legoverse makes up a decent chunk of everything, and therefore, has a likely chance for a wormhole leading here to exist. These wormholes can be often found within
Superiorverses
. Teleportation can also work. Funnily enough,
The Lego
may be strong enough to break the barrier of the Legoverse. This has never been proven.
The same strategies listed above can also help escape from the Legoverse, as these wormholes are two-way transportation systems.
Copyright Strikes
[
]
A common storm that can strike Legosgiants are Copyright Strikes. These rain down from patches of high concentration of Legases in an atmosphere of a Legosgiant. These are very dangerous to the residents of the Legoverse, because touching Copyright is about as dangerous as stepping on a brick. While these are very common, Copyright Strikes cover a small area of Legosgiants, and many species are forced to fly over Copyright Strikes to avoid stepping on bricks anyways. A Copyright Strike once wiped out a species, but it was already nearly extinct.
Legoduploverses
[
]
Also known as Dwarf Legoverses, Legoduploverses share the most of the same properties as the Legoverse. In fact, some Bricklings and Goonlings have made it to this alternate verse. The largest difference is that the Legoduploverse is only a few duodecillion lightyears long, in stark contrast with the Legoverse, which spans many Absolute Infinity light years. Copyright Strikes occur more often in Legoduploverses.
Legoians
[
]
People in the Legoverse that are in the town of lego city, and can appear anywhere else, but has to follow the rules of the Legoverse, or else they will take off themselves into pieces. In order for them to do anything, they simply are just in lego city, knowing what their doing. Anything that is not a official Legoian, will be Copyright Striked, but some had got away with it. But not for too long. Legoians can become anything they want, including jobs, like becoming a OTG.
