It is the It is the Earth again... again...
is a verse that like its name implies is the "again" of
It is the Earth again...
, which is itself an "again" of the
Earth
. It also has humans again... again...s and it has houses again... again...s as well. However, this verse is a lot more boring than It is the Earth again, with all human again...again...-made objects having absolutely no properties other than being a white and opaque color and having a Mohs hardness scale of 1.

Position
[
]
It is not contained within a solar system again... again..., but just orbits around another It is the It is the Earth again... again... of a slightly larger size. The largest It is the It is the Earth again... again... discovered is around Ωx the smallest It is the It is the Earth again... again... discovered, which is about the size of Ω Terminal Terminals.
Composition
[
]
It is the It is the Earth again... again... is composed of many
Terminal Terminals
floating (and rarely, orbiting) around its surface and an unknown substance (temporarily dubbed
Dark double matter matter
) forms everything else. The gravity interacts very weakly with this dark double matter matter, and so the human again...again...s can handle the forces.
