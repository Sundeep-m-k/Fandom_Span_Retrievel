Cuanday
is a partially
cuandavic
element and material. An
atom
of Cuanday has 23
protons
and 6 cuandavii. It is not that dense, at only 9.6 g/cm
3
. It has a chemical symbol of Cn.
Cuanday is very malleable and does not dedorm easily with temperature at the cost of not being that hard.

Usage
[
]
Cuanday is usually used in
multiversal
megacomputers and other high-level machines because of its quantum properties which allow the machines to increase efficiency and speed. It is also used in
cuandaic acid
, in junction with sulphur,
hyperenergised
nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen.
Cuandaic machines are very fast and generally have lots of uses. For example, a cuandaic roller press can roll diamonds into plates.
Creation
[
]
Cuanday is normally made running a piece of zinc through a cuandation machine, which can change 4 of its protons to cuandavii. However, this only gets you cuanday quay, which is normally not useful. To turn cuanday quay into normal cuanday, you have to let it undergo cuandavic radiation which normally takes around 1 week.
Cuanday can also rarely be found in extremely small amounts in
megaversal
voids. This requires 3 cuandavii to form naturally, which requires natural quantum mutation which is exceptionally rare. Then, they have to go to the same place and attach themselves to the right number of protons just to form
1
atom
of cuanday. It is estimated that there is 1 cuandavis per 390 cubed lightyears of a megaversal void, and 1 cuanday atom per 492,124,000 cubed lightyears.
Cuandaic Variants
[
]
Cuanday has two other variants. There is
Cuanday Quay
, which gas already been talked about and is just the predecessor ingredient to Cuanday. The other one is
Cuanday Smeele
, which is obtained by alloying Cuanday Quay to Cobalt. It is sometimes used in Cuanday machines.

How Cuanday and other stuff is made
Zinc is technically also classified as a variant of Cuanday, being given the alternate name of Cuanday Takemo.
Cuanday Smeele is named after
Smeele
.
