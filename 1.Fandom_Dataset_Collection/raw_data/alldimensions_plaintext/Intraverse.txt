Intraverses
are very small verses that are contained very deep within a
Meskoverse
space. They can be contained by
Meskoverse
or
Mistroverse
either. It is also a
Gas-verse
that contain only gas and absolutely nothing. They have red and green gas which has very strange properties. If someone gets to the corner of an Intraverse, they will begin to perceive Planck level objects as being larger than them, which is physically impossible, that is one of optical effects caused by inhaling these gases. Even the advanced costumes and gas masks will not save you because these gases are EXTREMELY caustic and can pass thru every matter including itself.
