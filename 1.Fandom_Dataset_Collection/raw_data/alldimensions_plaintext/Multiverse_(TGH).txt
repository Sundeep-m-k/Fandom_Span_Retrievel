The
Generic Hierarchy
's multiverses
, also known as
Generic Multiverses
differ from the
usual ones
in that they have a larger scale and an extremely high dimensionality.
They contain all the
universes
in which events could go like ours and do not violate the laws of physics and logic. In fact, these aren't conventional verses, but spaces restrained by axioms forming the laws of physics. This is a field of axioms that lie in three-dimensional spaces.
These weird physics also make them extremly hard to properly conquer, having a higher Kardashev scale than the one it'd usually have if these properties werent there.
Due to their scale and complexity, the Generic Multiverses cannot be contained by
Megaverses
unlike their original counterparts and are instead contained by
Collectionverses
