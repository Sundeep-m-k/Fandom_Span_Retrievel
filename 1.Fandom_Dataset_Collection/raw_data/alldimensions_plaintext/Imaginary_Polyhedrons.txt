The
Imaginary Polyhedra
are (currently) the only significant kind of extra
universal
polyhedral structure, and mostly serve to keep a
Multiverse
safe and colonizable.
Without Imaginary Polyhedra, there is no way to reach outside of Multiverses easily without some degree of brute forcing through them. This is because most interuniversal transportation technologies, including spaceships, are fueled by
Imaginary Energy
, an efficient power source for interuniversal travel thanks to
Imaginary Tetrahedra
.

How do they work?
[
]
Some Imaginary Polyhedra are powered by
Imaginary Energy
, some are artificially made by type-5 civilizations with interuniversal metals, some are just multiversal transportation hubs, and some can be combined to make "stacked" Imaginary Polyhedra.
The abilities of Imaginary Polyhedra are dependent on the amount and type of their faces, which mean that Imaginary Polyhedra can differ greatly from one another.
Only regular (platonic) Imaginary Polyhedra have been fully discovered by civilizations from
our Multiverse
.
Usages
[
]
Some Imaginary Polyhedra are used to store
Imaginary Energy
like a battery. However, they need to be wired to an
Imaginary Tetrahedron
using Imaginarium Wires, which are the only interuniversal wires.
