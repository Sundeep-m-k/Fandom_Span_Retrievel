History
Lore/Backstory
[

An infection
Spread
Can't be counted as it has no limits
How Dangerous
It is incredibly dangerous
What can it infect
All types of things can be infected.
Birth
It was born 24 hours ago when a TOG's experiment failed
Power
Boundless but can be prevented
Knowledge
It grows as it infects more
Limits of Infection
Basically boundless but this being will probably catch the attention of a TOG and whatever punishment this virus gets, one queen cell will always dodge it and warp the universe again and this cycle will go on and on
Long ago, there was a
TOG
who wanted to create clones of himself so that he can create an army to kill outer threats however he just could not make a perfect clone. All clone experiments were failures and then came an empty tube. The TOG thought it had produced nothing but there was something a very small virus that the TOG had not noticed. It was in hibernation so when the TOG threw that tube into a planet. After 24 hours, it woke up and created more cells of theirs which created spores and it started infecting the world
Types
[
]
Protozons
[
]
Protozons are the spores that infect other beings. There are two types of this spores
1) Reproduction Turner Spores
2) Offensive Turner Spores.
Offensive Turner themselves have two types
a) Full animal defense warpers
b) Only Cell defensive warpers
Reproduction Turner Spores
[
]
These spores turn whatever they land on into Reproduction Cells. They can't turn whole animals into Reproduction for unknown reasons so they choose to infect individual cells and bacteria and if the thing is a multicellular animal, they break down each of the cells and turn them into reproducing their virus and making them hosts.
Offensive Turner Spores
[
]
Offensive Turner Spores turned their hosts into defending the virus hivemind.
Full animal defense warpers
[
]
Some spores will turn the entire animal into defending the hivemind. This is used to defend bigger parts of the virus as they grow big, bigger threats will come.
Cell animal defense warpers
[
]
Many spores choose the method of breaking down the cells into individuals and infecting them and turning them to defend the hivemind and they also have joints so when and incredibly powerful threat comes. They will join together and make an abomination to neutralize the threat.
Phases
[
]
Reproduction Turners
[
]
All of them also have phases first we will be look at reproduction turners.
Phase 1
[
]
In this they search and land on a cell and inject their overpowered DNA to change the cells to a Cosmic Reproduction Cell. Or they break down the animal to individual cells and do this process.
Phase
￼
2
[
]
After the cell finishes turning into a Reproduction Cell, the spore goes into phase 2 where it starts turning into a Reproduction Pumper from where the other spores are released. It grows it size and opens a tunnel through it and after the transformation is finished then they have finished their short lifespan.
Phases
[
]
Offensive Turner
[
]
a) Full Animal Warpers
[
]
Phase 1 (Only Phase)
[
]
They find and land on an animal and warp the animal into a defensive animal and then they die.
b) Only Cell defensive warpers
[
]
Phase 1
[
]
They find and land on a cell and turn that cell into a defensive cell.
Phase 2
[
]
They then transform into some sort of cannon so then the cell will truly become a defensive cell as the cell can shoot from their "cannon". This is the end of the spores lifespan.
Cells/Animals
[
]
And then there are cells which defend as well as reproduce. They have no phases as they stay like that forever. There are two types.
1) Defensive Cells
2) Reproductive Cells
Defensive Cell
[
]
Defensive Cells well.....  defend. They have cannons and that's basically it. Extra: Defensive Animals defend also and they defend normally from the mechanism they used to have before they were infected.
Reproductive Cell
[
]
Reproductive Cells make spores.
Queen Cells
[
]
These cells (They can only be cells) have the most reproduction and highest defense. For each 1 million cells there are (Of any type) there is one queen cell. They are made when
Phase
[
]
They are made when 1 million cells are detected and then four spores (Of any type) land on one cell and transform to make that cell a queen cell. Two spores become cannons and the other two Reproduction pumpers
History
[
]
We know how it was created so now it's time for what is going to happen. (Tell us how much it is infected)
The infection had just started.
The Infection has reached the size of 1 cm
