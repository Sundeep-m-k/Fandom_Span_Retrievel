The text wall is a verse that is filled with groups of text split in various ways. This text can be changed by any life form that can access

.  The text is on a normally white background, but can be changed by updating text units.
Grouping
[
]
The Text Wall is grouped into 3 levels. These are the realms, tiles, and text units, which are the main structures of The Text Wall.
Realms
[
]
Realms are the main level of division of The Text Wall and can only be seen one at a time (per tab). You can find these by adding "/[any text]" to the end of the link. (
Example
) There are basically infinite realms, but most are empty, so they take up no space. (

Tiles
[
]
Tiles are the second level of division in The Text Wall, and you are able to see multiple of them at once. They are 8 text units tall and 16 text units wide and in a square shape. They can be used to make bigger spaces between things than text units, like in
/CartesianCoordinateSystem
.
Text Units
[
]
Text Units are the third and smallest level of division in The Text Wall. Each Text Unit can hold 1 byte, so you need a lot of these to make any actual impact. Just a sentence can use around 10-50.
Energy
[
]
When a text unit gets changed (by backspace OR adding a character), is releases energy that is around 10 joules. All of the updates make this place very energetic, and hot. With thousands of updates a second, it multiplies quickly. There are also more energetic text units, that contain links and coordinates. These use around 20 joules and 5 watts after to stay up.
