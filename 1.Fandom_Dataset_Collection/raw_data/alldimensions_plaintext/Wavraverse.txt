Native Species
[
]
There is one native species, and they are known as the Isajinmv. They are blue colored blobs made of a malleble material with a more solid appendage on top. This appendage has 8 fingers which end in a plateau-like shape. They are usually still, unless when they are looked away from

, in which they resume movement. They refuse to explain how they move. They communicate with each other and others through telepathy. They are on average 5.6 meters tall, but the largest grew to be 9.211 meters, and the smallest was only 1.42 meters.
'Planet' Clusters
[
]
The inside of the verse's main structure are clusters of planet-like objects lit up by unknown means, often called planet clusters. These clusters will often stretch tens of millions of light years, with the largest, the Basei-Laqu Cluster coming in at 21.8 billion light years large. Clusters larger than 1 billion light years are sometimes informally referred to as superclusters, but this designation is not commonly used.
The Planets Themselves
[
]
The 'planets', also, but uncommonly known as Wavraplanets, are planet-like objects which are the sole physical thing contained by the Wavraverse. Their composition is approximately 99.8% jeigrenihium, the 4.21 x 10

rd element, with trace amounts of akialsieuauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuaium, the 4.21 x 10

+ 2nd element, iron, and rubidium. They are held together by an unknown force. Due to pure jeigrenihium being malleble, the planets are somewhat malleable. They are usually 675 km to 123,873 km large, with the average size being 18,435 km. They hold Isajinmv on them.
Yelge
[
]
Yelge is the largest planet in the Warvaverse. It has a size of 4,571,021 km, and holds approximaely 521.273 billion Isajinmv, making it also the most populated planet in the Wavraverse.

Cameras count as looking at, unless they are turned off

No creatures execpt for other Isajinmv can view movement of them.
