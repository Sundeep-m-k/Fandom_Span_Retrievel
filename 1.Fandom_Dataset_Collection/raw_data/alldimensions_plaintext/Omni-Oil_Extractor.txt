Diagram of an omni-oil extractor.
Omni-oil extractors are hooked to the borders of
Metaverses
, where they use law funnels to siphon out law particles. They then mix these particles with liquid instability extracted from the instability extractors and mix both of these materials into
crude omni-oil
in a mixer. The crude omni-oil is then accelerated in a quantum accelerator to create omni-oil.
