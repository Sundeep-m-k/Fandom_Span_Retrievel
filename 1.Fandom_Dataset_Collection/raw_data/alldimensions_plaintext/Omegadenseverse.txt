Despite this verse being 87 meters in diameter it is several ( 12) times more massive than
The Final Absolute
, nobody knows why it is so dense or how the space around it acts as if it does not exist. All we know is that this verse is extremely dense. For some reason, objects are not attracted to this verse unless they are less than 300 meters away, in which they are immediately sucked in. Nobody knows what happens to people and things sucked inside as the mass doesn't change when they do get sucked in. Nobody knows what this verse is made of either. People hypothesize what the origin and composition of this verse is, some think it was made by a god such as
Dunkey Kong.
