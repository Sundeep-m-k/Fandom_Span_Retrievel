The
Final Superverse
is a type of verse that contains many
Final Boxes
into the structure of strange symbols (most commenly identified as the Aleph symbol) and, rarely, structures very similar to Superverses (most commonly
Terminal Icosahedrons
and
THE Atoms
). It does not have a very well-defined border.
Types of Alephs
[
]
There are 5 main aleph types (from most common to most rare):
Normal Aleph
Reflective Aleph
Transparent Aleph
Long Aleph
Dark Long Aleph
Normal alephs are thin, bright alephs that usually are found in clouds of alephs around other rarer types.
Reflective alephs look very similar to normal ones, sometimes being mistaken as being a normal one. They are reflective, unlike the opaque normal alephs.
Transparent alephs, although not super rare, are hard to find due to only their outlines being easily visible, and collisions with these must be thought of before traversing The Final Superverse.
Long alephs are similar to normal alephs, although they are much thicker and are prone to being broken from two long alephs colliding, although this is a very rare occurrence and has only ever been recorded twice.
Dark long alephs are the rarest and most elusive type of Aleph that are nearly black and hide out in the dark voids of The Final Superverse. Like
The Penteract
, no actual photos of dark long alephs have ever been taken, only that matter has been detected there.
