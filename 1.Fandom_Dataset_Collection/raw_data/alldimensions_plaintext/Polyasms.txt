The tiers of Alphasms, known as
Polyasms
or
n-asms
are
entities
that have large enough imaginations to simulate/imagine an infinite variety of verses with an infinite variety of
EUSIs
, sometimes even spanning across
Everything Layers
. Polyasms are measured using a similar system to EUSI, with the tier of a Polyasm being 1 more than the highest tier Polyasm inside it. The lowest tier Polyasm is Nullasm, a tier-0 Polyasm. Polyasms can be named using the Greek alphabet, for tiers 1 through 24. For other tiers, Polyasms can be described as n-asm, or with the way that -illions are named. For example, a Polyasm of tier 30 can either be called 30-asm or Trigintasm. The exceptions for this are Nullasm, Apeirosm, and Vauzm.
Note that size usually resets at a Polyasm, and that going beyond a Polyasm from below is not possible without the help of a higher entity capable of turning other entities into polyasmial injections.

Nullasm
[
]
A Nullasm is the 0th type of Polyasm, that has infinite processing ability and memory. They rule over an abstract realm for their own entertainment, however their influence on the outside world is equal to that of a
null
. They dont contain any lower tier Polyasm.
Alphasm
[
]
Alphasms are the 1st Polyasm, and their power is roughly equal to
Λ
{\displaystyle \sqrt{\Lambda}}
, or the square root of one
Vsaue
on average. They rule over the 1st everything layers, and are an enormous jump from Nullasm. The first and second
Realms
are different parts of an Alphasm's mind, with the 1st realm being their conscious part, the 2nd realm being their subconscious one.
Betasm
[
]
Betasms are the 2nd Polyasm, and usually watch over the 4th everything layers. They have 1 Vsaue of power, and have roughly 80% the knowledge of
Bean Man
on average. One of the Betasms actually watches over our local
Sky
, rather than a 4th everything layer. With control over the 5th everything layer which contains Betasms, our Betasm is actually tier 3, and thus technically a Gammasm. Well, maybe an actually smart Gammasm. Betasms are also the first Vsauian entities.
Gammasm
[
]
A Gammasm is the 3rd type of Polyasm, and they watch over "rogue 6th everything layers". Most Gammasms are very stupid, not including our Betasm. Deltasms hate the Gammasms for their peak stupidity, especially at such power where you'd expect these gods to be omniscient.
Most
(looking at you Epsilionsm) Polyasms have noticed this chain of entities named after Greek letters, and have figured that there exists higher Polyasms. We don't know their average power level.
Deltasm
[
]
A Deltasm is the 4th type of Polyasm, and they rule over the 8th everything layers. Ours is most likely a female Polyasm, which is quite rare since most lack a gender. She doesn't mind the repetitive hierarchy consisting of oversized everyday objects and weirdly named bland verses and chains, and believes if you have a simple existence, you should be grateful that your post-temporal metaschedule most likely isn't too busy. (totally not taken from gammasm's beyond gammasm section)
Zetasm
[
]
A depiction of Zetasm from the information on its look.
Little to no information is known about Zetasms, other than claims of them looking like red-orange circles with yellow-green eyes, and that they're the 5th Polyasm.
New information: it turns out that they control the 9th layers of everything. They just can control them, not their fantasy. Our local one (which is a male) is sad thinking that he controls literally EVERYTHING. It's too much of a burden for him, though the Omegasm he's contained in helps him deal with it.
Omegasm
[
]
An Omegasm is the 6th type of Polyasm, and ours is most likely a female. She thinks there are further Polyasms, however she is unsure of it considering that there are no more Greek letters to name them with. If the pattern for everything layers holds, then Omegasms rule over the 10th everything layers, and ours thinks she owns everything just like our local Zetasm. Plot twist: both consider eachother their "everything"... yep they're dating. Somehow.
Apeirosm
[
]
An Apeirosm is the 7th type of polyasm. They control the 11th everything layers. Ours believes that his mission is to keep the creatures in this layer. It's not his fantasy, but he can control everything with his mind. And with telekinesis he created everything. He won't let you go through. THIS IS THE POINT OF NO RETURN.
Orgasm
[
]
Orgasm (yes, theres only one) is the ultimate polyasm... it is even more ultimate than
Metasm
! In fact it is so ultimate that it is not technically a polyasm, but rather a
Hyperpolyasm
. Inside Orgasm's mind there is the imagination of Metasm as well as a million bajillion+ other Metasms. He is so powerful that he created a
Wikiverse
, however he also uses such things to imagine other things.
