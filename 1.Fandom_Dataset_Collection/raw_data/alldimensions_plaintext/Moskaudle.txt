The
Moskaudles
are the base form of almost everything Moskau in existence. It is thought to have been formed sometime near 1979. It contains 54
Untabsoverses
, and is one of the only type of
particles
to be made out of something this large.
Matter made out of Moskaudles behaves in every way exactly the same as everything about Moskau. Moskau itself in its purest form is not made out of Moskaudles, but made out of literally everything but Moskaudles (excluding things that contain Moskaudles of course). Moskaudles are very useless, as they are such a large particle for matter to be made out of, they cannot fit inside many refrigerators. Moskaudle-matter refrigerators are very valuable as people like becoming Moskau whenever they eat microwaves. Of course these microwaves are not made out of Moskaudles directly (that would be ridiculous), they are made out of Moskaudle soup.
The Moskaudles have a mass of -1 billion, as they're made out of 54 Untabsoverses but are named after Moskau, a law of physics that doesn't make sense but, every time you test it, sets the mass of the thing to -1 billion. The unit this -1 billion is in, is unknown, but it seems to be in every unit ever simultaneously.
