Picture of Guaca Regia, the color is really pretty in my opinion :)
Guaca Regia
is an extremely potent acid made from chemically reacting
cuandaic acid
and
coom
. Guaca Regia is extremely dangerous because it can dissolve ANY material found in a
Class 1
structure. Because of this and the fact that it is partly made of Coom, its molecular formula is kept confidential by our local
omniversal
authority.
Production
[
]
Guaca Regia is made from mixing cuandaic acid and coom at a temperature over 27,630 ºC. At this temperature, both of the substances are in a plasma state, and the way their electrons move makes them rearrange their molecular structure into Guaca Regia and a byproduct of hydrogen.

There are a few countries that have a decently sized guaca regia production industry like
Terabithia
. (feel free to add more)
Uses
[
]
Guaca Regia is used for a lot of stuff due to its dissolving properties.
Military
Obviously, if you had an acid that can dissolve basically everything, you'd wanna dump it on your enemies.
