Kasadia
is a planet located in some universe inside the
Multiverse
which orbits a star known as
BFM-1938440
. It has a size of 13,348 kilometers. Due to it being so close to its star, it has a ridiculous temperature of 1,083F (583C) during the day, meaning no life can exist on this planet. At night, the temperature drops by a lot but it is still pretty warm at 124F (51C). There are tons of active volcanoes and lava on this planet. When it rains, it rains extremely nasty chemicals like Triflic Acid and even cancer causing chemicals such as Benzene. There is no oxygen either. The air composition is: 93% Benzene (due to the liquid stuff turning into gas), 5% Hydrogen, 1.5% Helium, and the other 0.5% being a mix of many other random gases.
Minerals and Gemstones

Kasadia is home to many beautiful gemstones. In order to view these gemstones, scientists and geologists need to send incredibly strong robots to the planet. Each robot is attached with a camera. 9 different minerals and gemstones have been identified. All of these rocks have been collected and sent back to laboratories.
History of Kasadia
[
]
Like most planets, Kasadia was formed from space rocks and asteroids colliding with each other to create a larger rocky mass. The planet was flying through space for thousands of years until it fell in the orbit of a star. It ended up getting way too close to the star which caused its temperature to rise very quickly. This ended up becoming its permanent orbit. Ever since then, nothing has really happened on the planet.
