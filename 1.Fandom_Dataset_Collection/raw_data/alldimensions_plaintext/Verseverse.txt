More verses than any other verse
Verseverse
is a verse that contains the most verses.
Verseverse doesn't necessarily contain
all
verses, it just contains more of them than any other verse. That means that Verseverse, somehow, contains more verses even than those verses that contain all verses, or those verses that contain Verseverse. This is very strange and contradictory, but Verseverse doesn't care. It isn't the highest or the biggest verse. It simply contains the most verses. Just accept it.
Size...?

Since the Verseverse only needs to contain the most verses to satisfy its purpose, that means that it isn't necessarily big. It is big only in terms of
how much
it contains. So how big is it? I literally don't know.

What contains the Verseverse? I also don't know. But we know that it can be contained by any verse as long as its containing verse doesn't contain more verses than the Verseverse.
This doesn't make sense, because if a verse contains the Verseverse, it contains all of Verseverse's verses plus Verseverse itself, which makes it contain more verses than the Verseverse, which is impossible, because Verseverse contains the most verses and nothing can contain more verses than it. But really, it doesn't need to make senseÂ :>
