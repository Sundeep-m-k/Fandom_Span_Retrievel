Non conceptual verse
are verses with absolutely no concepts in all aspects, having null properties. They do exist, but the power of nonconceptuality makes them be in an inbethween of existence and non-existence. They're less than
nothing
.
At this stage, all living things cease to exist. Living objects are a concept. No images of non conceptual verses exist since light is also a concept.  They're contained by
conceptual black holes
, because the difference between them is immeasurable and an immeasurable number of these verses can fit in them.
