Cheese wheel
or
Wheese
is the bringer of the end times. It is an extremely terrifying
primordial
entity
, and in fact one look could give
gods
heart attacks even if they don't have ones at all!
It is pure armageddon, for it shall cause and bring the end times across
ALL
worlds
and
every
one
of
those
worlds
, no place is safe from WHEESE, Wheese is doom, it is the end to all things, it is a danger to even its own Wikiverse somehow.
Cheese wheel can also be counted as the offspring of
block of pork
since both are related to chaos and destruction. That means Wheese is a
Wikinomaly
, specifically the incarnation of armageddon.
Powers:
[

Black Hole Manipulation: Wheese can generate
Black holes
the size of
Supertime and Superrealities
(at minimum), and they can't die of hawking radiation. Mostly used as projectiles that can damage
Metawebs
.
Conceptual Erasure: Pretty self explanatory.
Bringing the end times. Its mere existence when summoned already causes chaos.
Insta-death: You instantly die, bypasses durability to some degree (similar to block of pork's cramp abilities), doesn't matter if you're immortal. Obviously can't affect other Wikinomalies nor above, though.
The Undo Barrier: A barrier that reverses and undos things to their first stage. Can be corrupted and thus weakened.
Omnipotent Self-Resurrection: It always comes back, even if you erased him so hard that it is gone no matter what, it still comes back. Only way to counter this is getting rid of
the Wikiverse Wheese is found at
.
Story
[
]
Regarding how was Wheese created, we could say it was the result of a piece of block of pork separating from it and developing into its own entity. This doesn't mean Wheese is weak though, since it roughly has 80% the strength of its creator. This is why it has a similar summoning method: you need to gather 9 artifacts known as "cheese slices", then put them together in order to summon Wheese.
Regarding their relationship, they treat eachother as allies, barely caring about their biological bond.
Cult of Wheese
[
]
Yes, Wheese does have a cult. It is around 3500520
OYC
old (which considering how old Wheese is, this is the equivalent of below a
Voidsecond
for it) and has a member count equal to how many
atoms
an
Omniverse
has (tiny for a Wikiverse's standard).

The cult of Wheese barely cares about block of pork.
