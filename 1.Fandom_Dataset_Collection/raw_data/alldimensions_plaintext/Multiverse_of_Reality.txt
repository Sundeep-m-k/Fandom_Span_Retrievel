Universe of Reality
The
Multiverse of Reality
is a huge megadimensional sphere that contains the Universe of Reality. There is a fractal at the center of the Multiverse of Reality. That fractal is just simply called "The Fractal". At the center of every single repeating fractal is a
Universe of Reality
. The starting point of the fractal is also simply called "The Center". There are no Universe of Realities in The Center.
The Multiverse of Reality also has varying dimensions. The dimensions change at a regular pattern, even though it can change into an infinite number of dimensions. That makes things more confusing.
There is also life in this verse. This life lives outside of The Fractal. The life is extremely advanced, and they use occasional corrupted verses and rogue Universes of Realities to power their ships and civilization. They are known as
The Outsiders
.
The Fractal also glows a faint blue tint as seen in the picture. It is unknown why that happens though. Other than
The Outsiders
, there are no creatures that exist outside of The Fractal in this verse.
The outside of The Multiverse of Reality is fairly unknown. The material that makes up the border of the verse is also unknown. It is completely transparent, and is extremely durable. Corrosive elements like
toxicium
do absolutely nothing to it.
