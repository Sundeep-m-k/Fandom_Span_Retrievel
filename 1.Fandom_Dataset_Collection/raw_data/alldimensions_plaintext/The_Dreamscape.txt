How to Enter
[
]
You have a very small chance to enter the Dreamscape by sheer chance, although the chance is too low to be significant. However, you can also enter the Dreamscape by glitching outside of places such as
.(
,
Unexistence
, and
Nine
.
50% of the time, you will be teleported into
Unexistence
(you will die instantly and your remains will go to a random verse if you are in Unexistence),
25% of the time, you will teleport into
The System: Loops
and get stuck in place for eternity,
24% of the time, you will be severely corrupted and disappear from existence;
and 1% of the time, you will go to The Dreamscape.
Areas in the Dreamscape
[
]
Although the Dreamscape is relatively similar to
The System: Loops
in terms of setup, its structure and contents are much more different. Unlike The System's dangerous and often insanity-inducing Loops and Stripes, the Dreamscape's areas are usually much more weird and messed up, although they can also be dangerous.
The first 7 areas are all dream-like sections, while the last 2 are very different.
While you are in an area within the Dreamscape, it will almost always be in a 3rd-person perspective. The viewer will usually not have much control over their surroundings, and is able to phase through the entire dream without much effort, although some parts are inaccessible.
In most of the areas, there will be a protagonist.
Area One
[
]
In the first area, the viewer is in a large, blocky world reminiscent of the game of Minecraft. 2 other entities will guide the protagonist around the world. At around 30 minutes of exploring the world, the entire world will suddenly shift into an alien, barren landscape which is somehow towering with scaffolding. After that, the viewer will be ejected and transported to another random area.
Area Two
[
]
In the second area, the viewer is in a very dark room with a large, heavy door. The protagonist will be begging for a mysterious, menacing entity on the other side of the door to not close the door. The entity will then, unsurprisingly, close the door, making the room go entirely black. A pair of 2 red eyes will appear at the far corner of the room, and the viewer will be ejected.
Area Three
[
]
In the third area, the viewer will be in the perspective of the protagonist. The protagonist is in a game-like area, and is being chased by blue entities on 4, small legs. They heavily resemble a Creeper from the game Minecraft. The protagonist will then try to outrun the blue Creeper-like entities, going through 4 stages, each more difficult than the last. When the protagonist escapes the 4th stage and "wins the game", they will suddenly be transported into space, where they will witness an argument between 2 presumably powerful entities. The viewer will then be ejected.
Area Four
[
]
In the fourth area,
a big ball appears and it goes BOOM! This kills all life ever the end
the viewer will go to a small house with the protagonist inside of it. The protagonist will find that there is an open door, and when walking inside, will find out that they are in a possibly infinite labyrinth filled with chairs stacked on top of each other. They will walk inside the chair labyrinth for seemingly days until they find themselves outside again. The viewer will be ejected afterwards.
Area Five
[
]
In the fifth area, a HUUUUUUUUUUUGE BALL APPEARS!!! it comes up to the surface, and no one expects it. there is a wave of shock throughout the entire audience as suspenseful music plays... for some reason idk why. Then, the ball starts to expand. The suspense is really going up, and everyone is scared. Some people were hiding, others were running, and a few tried to hug it like a grenade (why?) And then, after the DREADFUL EXPANSION, the ball turns white, and then goes
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And now nothing exists left. Nothing. The entire existence is gone, and nowhere exists anymore. Reality and nonreality has come to an end. Everything you know and dont know is gone. Everything, except for a tiny toilet. The viewer will be ejected afterwards.
Area Six
[
]
In the sixth area, the viewer will go to a house with the protagonist inside of it. A dust storm of sorts will happen, forcing everyone to evacuate their houses. The protagonist will try to use a bicycle as a method of transportation, although the bicycle won't work. Eventually, the protagonist will end up in a large bunker, with the dust storm having turned into a massive blizzard. The protagonist will then find a flight of stairs which go down for a very long way, and go down the stairs. After reaching the bottom, the protagonist has ended up in a strange house of sorts, with a open trapdoor revealing countless clothes beneath them. They will then go up the stairs due to unknown reasons. After the protagonist has made it all the way up the stairs, the viewer will be ejected.
Area Seven
[
]
In the seventh area, the viewer will be in a maze. The protagonist is being chased around by another creature. In the end, the protagonist will get out of the maze just in time. Once they have escaped the maze, they will be in a house. They will go up the stairs only to find that it is a warzone, and will try to run down the stairs with another entity chasing them. They will manage to go outside the house, with that entity trying to hunt the protagonist down. The protagonist will eventually run back inside the house, and the viewer will be ejected.
Area Eight and Nine
[
]
In the eigth and ninth areas, there is nothing except for 16 large cylinders. These cylinders do not do much. If you touch any of the cylinders, you will be transported to a random area and frozen in place for x seconds (with x being the number of times you entered an area in the Dreamscape).
