The Field
is a large, white, square shaped object made of compressed
blueprint particles
. It contains all possible patterns of realms on its
Spires
and has large laser cannons mounted at its corners. The Field is actually surprisingly bright, this is because of its many Type 2 Orbis, which light it up quite a lot. The Field is always growing to accomodate for new Spires being born, and the way it grows is by taking a small cut of the growth energy of coros that land on the ground to put into its own growth, and since the amount of
Orbis
and Spires in the Field grow exponentially, so does the Field itself.
The laser cannons on the four corners of the Field are weapons of mass destruction, able to destroy whole Orbis in just a few minutes. The cannons are powered by cosmic energy harvested from coros floating in the deep abyss of
sky
. Each cannon is operated by 12 entities of varying power and status creatively named Laser Cannon Operators or LCOs for short. The cannons are fired to move the Field through
sky
and to eliminate threats.
