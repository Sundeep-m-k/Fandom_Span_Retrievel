Spelling
[
]
The language has its own alphabet (yet to be created), but it also has a romanized alphabet.
Romanized alphabet
[
]
M = /m/
B = /b/
P = /p/
W = /β̞/
FH = /ɸ/
VH = /β/
BB = /ʙ/
f = /f/
v = /v/
NH = /n̼/
TH = /t̼/
DH = /d̼/
CH = /θ̼/
GH = /ð̼/
C = /θ/
G = /ð/
T = /t/
D = /d/
S = /s/
Z = /z/
SH = /ʃ/
ZH = /ʒ/
TSH = /t͡ʃ/
N = /n/
DZH = /d͡ʒ/
R = alveolar, postalveolar, or retroflex trill (the language does not distinguish between these sounds)
RR = a trill with your tongue moving from the hard palate to the alveolar ridge, or from the alveolar ridge to the hard palate, depending on the letter before it.
K = /k/
X = /x/
Q = /q/ or /ʀ̥/
' = a short pause, this symbol is used only in loanwords
Instead of a space, it is common to instead use a hyphen between words. In the romanized alphabet, there is always a hyphen between related words (like a noun and its adjectives)
Grammar
[
]
It uses nominative-accusative alignment.
Sentence Structure
[
]
At the beginning of any sentence, there is always a bilabial that marks the subject and the possessor of the subject. After the object of any sentence, there is a long vowel. In any situation where the clusters /β̞v/ or /ʙv/ would appear, the /v/ is dropped, in both pronunciation and spelling.
Articles
[
]
The language does not use articles, however it does use the word "k" to mark any word as plural. Example sentence: Pshq-k vr sri. (Your friends go to the place). Any number can also be used instead of "k" in this situation. In some rare situations, the k is already part of the word.
Adjectives
[
]
Adjectives can be used at any location near a verb, but can only be used after the subject and before the object. between a word and the adjective(s) describing it, there is a short vowel sound.
Participles
[
]
Participles are created by adding the word "sh" (already) before the verb. If the first sound of the verb is already sh, then it will become tsh and still have the sh before it.
Aspects
[
]
The language has two aspects, imperfective and perfective. The perfective aspect is marked by the word "sh", while the imperfective is not marked.
Dictionary
