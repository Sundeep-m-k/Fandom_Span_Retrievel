The Darkverse is a
universe
where everything is either black or just dark. No light exists in this universe thus leading to the conclusion that only dark photons exist in this universe. Due to it being the exact opposite of the Lightverse, everything that is inside the Darkverse will become

times darker than its luminosity in our Universe However, the local entities called the Darkversians are adapted to the darkness as they had developed to see in the dark. Also, the light within this universe can't reflect off any surfaces and would get instantly absorbed by anything leading to there not being any light. Along with that, light in this universe is extremely slow, only going as fast as 1 nanometer per 1000 years which is sheer nothingness compared to
the speed of light
in
our universe
which is dwarfed by the speed of light in the
lightverse

A way to create this universe is by taking a Lightverse and reversing the characteristics of light which would intern make everything dark, thus leading to the mass extinction of Lightversians across the Universe and giving rise to the Darkversians.
It is also known that the Darkverse orbits around The Lightverse creating a Binary Universe.
