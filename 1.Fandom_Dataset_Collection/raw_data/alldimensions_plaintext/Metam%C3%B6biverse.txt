The Metamöbiverse is a -verse that has similar properties to
Möbiverses
, having visuals similar to Möbiverses, except for the size.
This is the beginning of the Metahyperchain.
Unlike normal Möbiverses, Metamöbiverses are made from
torubarriers
, which allows them to have much more layers of Metamöbiverse containing themselves.
Visibility

]
Because of vibrations of torubarriers, Metamöbiverses glow a bright blue, a color that is sustained through the rest of the Metahyperchain.
