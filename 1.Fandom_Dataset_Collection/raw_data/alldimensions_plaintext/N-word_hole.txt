The
N-word hole
is a very dangerous blank verse. It consists of darkness, and photons are not allowed to be housed or even exist within it.
Accessing and Inside
[
]
The N-word hole can be accessed through an exponentially massive black hole. It is inhabited by black guardians who control entities familiar with secrets of the hole. One who perceives the world by capturing photons is unable to orientate themselves inside it. However, one can use any other sense to view the dimension.
True name
[
]
The true name of the N-word hole is forbidden to pronounce to all strangers. Doing so will lead to being banished from the current plane of existence across all verses. There are currently 3 entities known to have fallen victim to this fate.
Concept of maximum speed
[
]
Thanks to the absence of photons, speed of any object becomes the limit if it surpasses that of any other object inside the hole. This allows for infinite velocity.
