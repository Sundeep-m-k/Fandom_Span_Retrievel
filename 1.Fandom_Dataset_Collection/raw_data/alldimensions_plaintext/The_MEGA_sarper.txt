Mega Sarper
is the fourth sarper in the sarper chain,  this netherite one contains Hyper Sarpers like the digits of Ï€
What's really strange about this one is how it's special effect is changing or flipping or outright deleting gravity every 4.5 days and it turns to normal on the fifth day
It's made out of netherite and it's basically has hyper sarpers everywhere if u think about it these hyper sarpers usually float in the air
