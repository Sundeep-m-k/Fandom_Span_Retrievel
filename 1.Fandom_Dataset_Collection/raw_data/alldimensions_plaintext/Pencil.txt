Anatomy of a Pencil
[
]
A simple diagram of a pencil's 4 parts
Pencils have a strange anatomy. Their bodies are divided into 4 different parts, each with different usages and abilities.
The Shell
[
]
One of the biggest parts of a pencil is their shell. The shell of a pencil is simply a relatively thick layer covering a thin piece of "lead" or "graphite" (as it is called on Earth) which is at the center of a pencil. The shell has many uses, one of its major ones is to act as a shield against outside things. The shell of a pencil can be made from almost any material possible.
The Lead
[
]
The inside of a Pencil, known to humans as the "lead", is a thin, sometimes cylindrical piece of material which is at the center of a pencil. The lead is usually considered to be a pencil's brain, and without the lead, a pencil would not be able to function. Because of this, pencils which are longer and are new are usually more intelligent, while older, more used pencils tend to show less intelligence. The type of material used to form the pencil's lead also matters greatly, with the most powerful pencils having a lead composed of pure Wayb'wab (a substance that literally transcends existence and is able to give entities ridiculous power). As a pencil ages, its lead will slowly start to shrink after it has been used, until after about 16,606,682,186,605,448
OYC
, when all of the pencil's lead has been used up and the pencil will die.
The Eraser
[
]
The eraser is a portion of a pencil that is attached to it via the binder. An eraser is usually used to erase entities which pose a threat to a pencil, although it can also be used for much more. There has been a growing controversy to whether the erasers and the pencils are actually separate entities as the erasers have sometimes shown short bursts of consciousness as shown in about 4,432
OYC
, when an eraser threatened to kill a pencil if the pencil didn't let the eraser become powerful. There have also been incidents where an eraser has separated from a pencil through unknown means and started killing other pencils.
The Binder
[
]
The binder is an object, usually composed of a very strong material, which holds together the eraser and the rest of the pencil. If the binder breaks, the eraser will detach from the pencil and the pencil will no longer be able to erase things unless the eraser is reattached or the pencil recieves outside help.
Abilities of a Pencil
[
]
Pencils have a wide range of abilities, ranging from simply moving all the way to altering and transcending existence.
Most, if not all pencils have the ability to create and erase things via the lead and the eraser. Stronger pencils will be able to create/erase things better than weaker ones. Pencils are usually to do these things:
Create things via their lead
Erase things via their eraser
Move up to ~1.6 trillion LY per 16/358 of a minute
Absorb all forms of material (although absorbing corruptive materials is damaging)
Merge together into one pencil
Survive a
Cosmic Cannon
shot at point-blank range (although the pencil will be damaged somewhat)
Change
Existence Ranks
An average pencil will usually be able to destroy a
Universe
in only about a few seconds and a
Multiverse
in around a minute, placing an average pencil in about the middle of the Pre-Omniverse class in
The Official Cosmic Entity Hierarchy
.
However, other pencils can be much, MUCH more powerful. Any pencil which is able to destroy an
Omniverse
-size construct can gain the ability to have multiple forms, with each form being exponentially stronger than the last. A pencil which is able to destroy an
ε
0
{\displaystyle \varepsilon_0}
-sized construct can have up to 3 forms; a pencil which is able to destroy a
θ
{\displaystyle \theta}
-sized construct can have up to 4 forms; a pencil which is able to destroy a
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
-sized construct has at least 5 forms (all the way to 14 forms); a pencil which is able to destroy an
ƒ
-sized construct can have 15 forms, and the strongest pencil has exactly 16 forms.
Origin of the Pencils
[
]
A piece of text found close to
The Black Realm
. It is unknown what the text is saying. Extensive study of the writing has uncovered what appears to be the transliteration of the text. Parts which are in brackets do not have concrete transliterations.  "Vaaaappz xaz [chj]aa k[?] [t]aa[v'] aaa [?]x[chj]aaa [?][?]"
The pencil species have a relatively murky history, and few details are known about their origins or early history. However, clues about their true nature are scattered around areas like
The Black Realm
, written in obscure writing systems and on strange, alien objects not found in our
Realm
.
Relationship to
The Pencil Language
[
]
Contrary to popular belief, the Pencils did not create the Pencil Language, although the pencils frequently use it. The creator of The Pencil Language is usually attributed to an ancient civilization known as "Awef", who were destroyed long before even the creation of the
First Realm
. There has been a piece of text found in The Black Realm reading "Awef, boosba kefeefek, kefeefekoshyf waybewafow, boosba boosyiwkek Awefokryfow norpekan."  (Awef, the first civilization, the creator of [The Pencil Language], was destroyed by the seer in the first time period." It is unknown what "the seer" is, although it is theorized to be a creation of Awef.
The pencils have made countless modifications to The Pencil Language over the eons, such as the inclusion of the words for "pencil" (wakab) and "eraser" (frahash). Other words like "suwy" (cycle) and the words ending with 'y' were also created by the pencils (with the exception of "pay", "yoy", "siy", "suy", and "key").
The Pencils are also theorized to be the creators of the most recent Pencil Language script, although this is probably not the case.
