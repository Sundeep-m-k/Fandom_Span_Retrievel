Like
The Cubinder
, The Duocyclinder is invisible to all cameras (except
negaspectral cameras
). However, unlike The Cubinder, it seems to only be visible or interact with 50% of all objects. However, some pressure measurers have been able to 'photograph' The Duocyclinder

, or at least make an approximation of what a cross-section looks like. The Duocyclinder is also static and does not rotate.

There is a lot of noise in the image that is shaped like the characters '|()()', but this is not an actual part of The Duocyclinder.
