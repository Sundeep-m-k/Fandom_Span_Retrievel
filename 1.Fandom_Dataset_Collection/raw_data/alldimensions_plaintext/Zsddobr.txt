Structure
[
]
Zsddobr is quite large, for a regular star system. Stretching over 4 LY, it contains many planets and a large number of
stars
. Zsddobr is normally divided into 4 zones, based on the temperature of each section:
The Center
[
]
The center of Zsddobr is where the 2 stars that hold Zsddobr together are. These stars, since Zsddobr is a binary star system, orbit each other. Both stars are extremely similar, to the point that they are almost indistinguishable.
Inner Area
[
]
The Inner area of Zsddobr is quite packed. This layer contains 2 stars and 4 planets. Space debris is also common here. This layer's planets are very hot, and all of them are barren or covered with lava.
Zshzs
[
]
Zshzs, also known as the Magma Planet (although less referred to due to
another planet being called the same name
), is the closest planet to the center of Zsddobr, and is a scorching wasteland. The small planet is mostly covered with ash, igneous rocks, volcanoes, and lava. No life exists on this planet.
Nsttrm
[
]
Nsttrm, also known as the Barren Planet, is the planet right after Zshzs. Nsttrm has a very flat terrain, with parts of it resembling valleys. Most of Nsttrm is barren, with no plant or animal life. Microscopic life has been found on Nsttrm.
Aogr-Nsttrm
[
]
Aogr-Nsttrm, whose name directly translates to Life-Barren, is a very similar planet to Nsttrm, and has almost the exact same terrain. However, Aogr-Nsttrm also has a massive cave system underneath, some of which are so huge that they have their own weather. Most of the life in Aogr-Nsttrm resides here. Aogr-Nsttrm has 2 moons, both of which are very small.
Dzsaa
[
]
Dzsaa is the last planet of the Inner Area, and is right after Aogr-Nsttrm. Dzsaa's name translates to "small planet", and has a very elliptical trajectory. Dzsaa is very small and lightweight compared to the other planets, and so is more easily influenced by gravity. So far, only rudimentary life has been found on Dzsaa.
The Outer Area
[
]
The Outer Layer is the 2nd area of Zsddobr, and contains 6 planets. This area is a lot colder than the Inner Area, and life is more common. Many of the planets here have liquid water and life.
Esyrtu
[
]
Esyrtu is the first planet of the Outer Area, and is mostly covered with land. The spots that aren't land is ocean. Esyrtu currently has 9 official oceans, some of them sporting life as well. The land terrain is mostly flat, with occasional mountainous terrain.
Pvrsm
[
]
Pvrsm is the 6th planet in Zsddobr, and is covered with a massive ocean. Unlike Esyrtu, Pvrsm has no land. Inside this ocean are countless species, mostly fish. Pvrsm also happens to be in the Goldilocks Zone for Zsddobr, hence all the life. Pvrsm has 45 moons, all of which cause massive tides to occur on Pvrsm's ocean.
Gptrdy
[
]
Gptrdy is the 7th planet. Gptrdy's terrain is characterized by its very flat and green plains, and also its diverse plant life. Gptrdy is way bigger compared to the other planets in the Outer Area, and has over 100 moons.
Odasmf
[
]
Odasmf is the 8th planet, and has relatively similar terrain to Esyrtu, also with a massive ocean, but unlike Esyrtu, Odasmf has several island chains scattered around. These islands are ridden with all kinds of volcanoes that constantly erupt lava. These island chains are slowly getting bigger from the cooled-down lava, and estimates say that in 10 OYC, Odasmf will no longer have a visible ocean.
Dzppyj
[
]
Dzppyj is a planet in Zsddobr that is unusually smooth. Dzppyj does not have any mountains, hills, valleys, or any variation of those, and only has a completely flat plain covering it. How this happens isn't fully understood.
Vpaf
[
]
Vpaf is the 10th planet, and is a transition between the Outer Area and the Deep Area. Vpaf is partially covered with ice, with the other part being mostly mountains or plains.
The Deep Area
[
]
The Deep Area is extremely far away from the center of Zsddobr, and has 4 planets. These planets are covered with ice, and are extremely cold. Temperatures in the area can reach all the way down to Absolute Zero.
Ovr
[
]
Ovr is the first planet of the Deep Area and the 11th planet in Zsddobr. Ovr's name translates to Ice Planet, which matches its landscape of towering ice mountains and freezing ice plains. Most of the life in Ovr is underground, as to get more warmth to survive.
Gtrrxomh
[
]
Gtrrxomh is the 12th planet of Zsddobr. Gtrrxomh is even colder than Ovr, and any source of heat in Gtrrxomh is almost nonexistent. Temperatures here can reach all the way down to -150 degrees Celsius. All the life in Gtrrxomh has developed extremely thick fur to cope with the freezing temperatures.
Sndpaiyr Xrtp
[
]
Sndpaiyr Xrtp is the closest planet to the center to have a consistent temperature of absolute zero. Sndpaiyr Xrtp has extremely mountainous terrain, with some mountain ranges stretching across Sndpaiyr Xrtp for over 10,000 miles, 97% of Sndpaiyr Xrtp's circumference.
Naoxxstf
[
]
Naoxxstf is a small planet, and is extremely cold, with absolute zero temperatures being even more common. Naoxxstf has extremely powerful blizzards and storms, able to blow away a regular creature straight into outer space.
The Distant Area
[
]
This is the last area of Zsddobr, and is the furthest. All of the 3 planets in this area always have absolute zero temperature, and most objects/planets are very small. Distances between planets in this area can be up to 3 LY, making traveling between any planet insanely hard.
Gstsesu
[
]
Gstsesu is the first planet of the Distant Area. This planet has no life, and is basically the opposite of the first planet, Zshzs. Gstsesu is a freezing planet, with absolute zero temperatures. Any sort of heat source is now impossible to find, and winds on Gstsesu can reach to insane speeds.
Ozqpddonar
[
]
Ozqpddonar is the 2nd planet of the Distant Area. Ozqpddonar, since it is so far away, does not resemble a real planet, and instead is more of an asteroid or clump of space rock. Ozqpddonar's exact origins are unknown, but it is theorized to have come to Zsddobr quite recently (in the cosmic scale).
Gityjrdy
[
]
Gityjrdy is the last officially recognized planet of Zsddobr. Gityjrdy is the smallest planet out of all planets in Zsddobr, and has no life. Gityjrdy might have come from outside the
Yottaverse
, since many alien materials have been found on Gityjrdy that couldn't have been from inside the Yottaverse.
