Rogue Archverses
are
Archverses
that aren't bound to their
superior
Archverse by remaining in a reasonably stable situation. They are also classified as
rogue
if they are non-
Hyperverse
Archverses whose superior verse is not an Archverse. A great portion of these verses are
mismatched Archverses
.

How Archverses become rogue
[
]
Under common and average conditions, Archverses are expected to remain in a stable position within their superior Archverse. This is done by remaining still or slowly drifting along through the void,
Universes
bounded together by a
terminal sphere
or by
Darismuth orbits
, getting entagled within a structure made out of Archverses, amongst other things. Below is a list of easily describable methods through which Archverses go rogue.
Slingshots
[
]
A most common way that Archverses become rogue is through the same method that spacecraft gains momentum by oribitng a planet for a short while. Entering the outer edge of a "gravitational" well, not close enough to become stable or to fall in, but getting slingshotted across space.
In order to end up in this situation, the Archverse must already be in an unstable system, or be targeted by a rogue or artifical body, including other rarer and local-
law
-specific methods.
Wormholes
[
]
Wormhole-esque structures that act as portals through warped spacetime are very easily capable of turning unsuspecting archverses into rogues. Much more so than the aforementioned slingshot method, but such structures are much, much less frequent in numbers.
Collisions
[
]
When two Universes collide, it is very likely that they will annihiliate each other, or with a large enough size difference one merges in with the other. However, on rare occasions, it is possible for two Universes to collide, with the right conditions, for them to bounce off each other. This is usually done when two Universes of approximately equal size hit each other at a rather slower speed, yet fast enough to not get attracted together (like
capture clouds
of
our Multiverse
). For Universes with stronger barriers, this type of collision will occur more frequently for easily imaginable reasons. Universes colliding at very acute angles also increases the chances of non-lethal collisions by multiple factors.
Artificial
[
]
For one reason or another, a civilization may find itself wanting to transport an Archverse from one place to another. The ways that some go around doing this are enumerable, but an example of Universe manipulation can be shown inside of our Multiverse.
An efficient way of doing this, is to use technology which triggers the Higgs mechanism in a controlled manner to create large amounts of mass in little space and gravitationally pull a Universe in a pre-calculated determined path.
Rogue Universes
[
]
Rogue Universes comprise the majority of rogue Archverses, as they are easiest Archverses to send off into unstable territory. Archverses like
Metaverses
are unlikely to fall into openings large enough for wormhole transport, usually don't get into orbital situations or encounter such slinghtshot potential situations, and collisions are often far too energetic to not penetrate the delicate border of the Metaverse.
Rogue Universes are one of the least likely Universe types to bear life for long periods of time after their departure from order, as any collision with another celestial body is more than likely to result in complete obliteration, or at the very least a very strong restructuring of the inside of the unfortunate Universe.
Rogue Multiverses
[
]
Rogue
Multiverses
occur less frequently than rogue Universes, but are still mobile enough to get into situations like mentioned above if they aren't careful enough. A collision of a rogue Multiverse with a larger body is usually less detrimental to the Universes within, as they are essentially protected by a large shell. However, the potential catastrophical results come in later, as if two Multiverses collide and merge, their Universes will too, forced to live under a hybrid combined version of their respective systems of laws
