The
BLOODYERRIAVerse
is a universe that has gotten so huge, that the every matter in this universe has now turned into Black Matter. More on that later. But anyways, absalutely no one protects this universe, so any enemies could just damege this universe. But do you REALLY think its that unprotected? Well it has defences that will destroy anything that comes too close. These defences will also be listed below.

Defences
[
]
These are the defences:
Mega-Plunger AKA. MP
[
]
The MP are used for attacking and movement. They will clog up anybodys mind from a distance, but they are not quite like defences.
Black Matter Sprayer AKA. BMS
[
]
The Black Matter Sprayer is very simple. Because it sprays Black Matter Balls at enemies, and because the are so dense, they can pack a punch.
Black Matter Fracal Snake AKA. BMFS
[
]
The BMFS is a fractal snake that can turn, and steer. They have venom which kills anything alive. So people have to be carefull around the BLOODYERRIAVerse.
Black Matter
[
]
Black Matter is matter that is made up of gluons, so they are very dense. But that is a diffrent kind of gluon, because of how many diffrent gluons its made up of, so
it can be really easy to destroy, or almost impossible to.
The Black Matter can turn any matter into itself. They can only exsist inside the BLOODYERRIAVerse, because of how diffrent it is from the ouside and other universes. And the Mass, Gravity, Speed, Friction, Stableisum all are diffrent from one another. So basicly, every gluon is different from eacother.
Matter Spiner
[
]
The Matter Spiners spin matter everywhere, and they get faster by doing that. And when the get so fast that they are crumbleing from their speed, they will create new ones... so the BLOODYERRIAVerses size will grow infinitely forever. They have strings of Black Matter that move, which creates more movement.
Matter Spiners at smaller sizes create shells, because they cant multply at smaller scales, just like how childeren cant have se-
