Obama-Xenoverse
The
Obama-megaverse
is the last and biggest verse in Obamachain. It’s bigger than the
Obama-Xenoverse
and its color is green due to the abundance of life in it. There is plant life and opium organisms in it, but we know that they live only in the
Obama-megaverse.
This verse is the only one that is different from the rest of the other Obamaverses, and its shape is distorted from the rest due to its excessive size, and even within it you will find a small percentage of the MultiObama-Xenoverse (a small percentage of matter), as is the case with
MultiOdd
.
Layers

]
The first layer is like a radiocative matter. It’s the white part of this verse, and the second layer is the light-green part. It’s the only one with the highest rate of life, and finally the third and last layer, she doesn't care.
