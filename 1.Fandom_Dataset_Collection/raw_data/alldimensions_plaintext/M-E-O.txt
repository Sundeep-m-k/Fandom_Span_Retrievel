that will then redo the cycle. A M-E-O can grow even if there is nothing. This is because it transforms dark matter into food that it then consumes.
The M-E-O's has 8 tentacles on it's mouth with which it traps and engulfs any matter it sees. Inside the mouth of the beast, there are tentacles that point backwards. They're there, because if something tried to escape, it easily could. So to prevent that, the M-E-O pointed the tentacles backwards so stuff would get trapped. Also, being small wont save you, since a M-E-O knows it has eaten you and will close its mouth and then grab you. After that, sticky matter will decompose you and turn your matter into his.
You might be wondering how antimatter doesn't explode with contact. This is because it can switch the matter it is made out of. If you are made of antimatter, M-E-O will turn the place you are in into antimatter. It has holes in its body with magnets inside that repel any different (destructive) matter.
