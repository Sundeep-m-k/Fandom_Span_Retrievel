About AJN's Number
[
]
AJN's Number
is a prediction about how many
AJN-Verses
there are. By the way is is kinda like a jan misali (or how you spell it) video so yea.
Part 1: Age of
AJN-Verses
[
]
AJN-Verses
that are
around today
are estimated to be around 13 trillion years old. Each extinct generation was around 1.9x the amount the current generation is, meaning...
1 generation before: 2.47 trillion
2 generations before: 4.69 trillion
Because of this,
AJN-Verses
are estimated to be
T
R
E
E
(

)
{\displaystyle \mathrm{T} \mathrm{R} \mathrm{E} \mathrm{E} \bigl(3\bigr)}
years old. The original size formula is
AJN-Verse Type 1
=1 yoctometre, and it being bigger would slowly destroy others due to lack of space.
Part 2: How many atoms are there?
[
]
There are around
10
78
{\displaystyle 10^{78}}
to
10
82
{\displaystyle 10^{82}}
atoms in the Universe.
There are around
10
10
10
7
{\displaystyle 10^{10^{10^7}}}
universes in the Multiverse, let's say it's the same for Multiverses in a Megaverse, etc.
That means there are around
10
78
{\displaystyle 10^{78}}
to
10
82
{\displaystyle 10^{82}}
times
10
↑
↑
25
{\displaystyle 10\uparrow\uparrow25}
atoms, meaning there are at least
10
78
{\displaystyle 10^{78}}
to
10
82
{\displaystyle 10^{82}}
times
10
↑
↑
25
{\displaystyle 10\uparrow\uparrow25}
AJN-Verses
, because each
AJN-Verse Type 1
contains at least 1 atom.
Part 3: Final estimation
[

Because they take up
Petaverse
s, the final estimation is around
