White it has almost total power over all of the Shenaverse, it has the most power in its domain The Grass Field. It is able to go outside the Shenaverse, but it does not possess any power outside of it, except for the ability to traverse inter-universal space

in a void in the Shenaverse created by an unknown party for
THE
sheep's use. It acts as
THE
sheep's sandbox, domain, and home. The Grass Field is where

On The Grass Field,
