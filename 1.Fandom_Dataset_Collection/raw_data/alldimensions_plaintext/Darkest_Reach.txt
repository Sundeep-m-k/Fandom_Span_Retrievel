This is a vast area of unknown clusters none of these are classified these universes are a darkish purple and hover in a dark void. The darkest reach is almost impossible to get to this cluster" you have to travel 900.98.99 Quintilian light years away. If you ever get to this area, it's so dense and tight that you may be squeezed to death by. The Universes here don't have life no humans no complex life forms. stars cant form here and no planets are here. These Universe come in different sizes ovals, balloon shapes and perfect spheres some of these universes could have been long replaced with a super massive black hole Due to the universes colliding and all the black holes colliding and the black hole becoming bigger than TON 618 almost 10000 trillion solar masses.
Creation
[
]
The creation of this universe cluster was made by dark matter holding it all together, but some things go bad with-it gravitational forces force universes together once they collide they don't make much of an explosion. An image of one colliding is down below. when these universes collide, they form black holes (A lot of them) most of the black holes make up the cluster almost 25% of it.

Classification
[
]
This universe is classified finally it has been declared as a class 3 due to its unlikely nature.  for being somewhat dangerous it is riddled with black holes that are just over the size of the sun, the pressure is so dense it can crush human if they were to set foot in this hell hole of a universe cluster. Some of these Black holes are bigger than the one in our universe

location of darkest reach
Some of these universes can have a little light reflecting off of it causing the illusion of an eye in the photo up there on the info box. This cluster only gets a little bit of light reflected on to it and it takes light 2 the power of 9 years to reach it due to how far it is. If we could use our telescopes to point it out from here. the universe is in a cluster called boomer-728 thus cluster is Gogol light years away from us if we were to look at it from a telescope on the ground, we will see nothing just an empty void. the image over there is the location of it, it looks like its behind it but its 500 billion more light years farther away.
