Structure
[
]
The structure of the Primordial Strings contains metaballs that each contains a Primordiolis. They're made out of kevlium, a non-Newtonian fluid.
Ultraviolet Barriers
[
]
These are barriers that surround the metaballs. We can't see it throughout our eyes, but a camera can see it.
Infrared Connectors
[
]
These are structures that connect spheres to make metaballs. The visibility is the same as ultraviolet barriers.
