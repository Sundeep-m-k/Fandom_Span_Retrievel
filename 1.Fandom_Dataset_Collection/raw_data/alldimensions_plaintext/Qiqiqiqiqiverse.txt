The Qiqiqiqiqiverse is a giant, relatively unstable universe containing 14
Delaverses
.
The Qiqiqiqiqiverse is primarily composed of 2 types of sentient structures, the Q's and the i's.
The Q's are very stable, and help to prevent the Qiqiqiqiqiverse from getting destroyed. They will bind up holes in the Qiqiqiqiqiverse and protect it if the verse is attacked.
The i's are much less stable, and will corrupt the Qiqiqiqiqiverse if left unchecked. They have been in a war with the Q's ever since -5,432,594,001,011
OYC
, and are bitter rivals with them as well.
In -4,320,129,348 OYC, the Qiqiqiqiqiverse was consumed by Largoinfin. Unlike nearly every other verse that has been consumed by the cosmic entity, this verse remained completely intact. It is thought that this is the work of the Q's, who, while unsuccessful at preventing the verse from being eaten, managed to preserve its existence inside Largoinfin.
