Note that he was born on
August 1, 1291
, but not in the same time as
our
August 1, 1291. In his universe, that date happened
over a trillion years ago
.
Our Universe
came into existence
a trillion years after
SwitzerlandBall was born. So, from his perspective,
today would be
:
One trillion, thirteen billion, and eight hundred million years
since his birth.
And it's been:
One trillion, thirteen billion, seven hundred ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-seven thousand, nine hundred seventy-five years
since he and his wife
departed their original universe
(in their 2025).
