The Beginning
[
]
(taken from mongus bible, The beginning, part 1, verse 1.)
In the beginning,
Godus
created the
Amongverse
and among planet. The planet was void and pure nothing. Among us god saw among light, and he knew among light was the solution of this problem, so he said "LET THERE BE AMONG LIGHT!" and the Among light appeared, then Godus created the first crewmates and one of them was an impostor. Among us god saw that as impostor was bad to crewmates and god made a difference beetween them. Impostor then killed crewmates but the crewmates left 67 children, impostor left 23 children before among us god punished him to death, but before he did, among us god said "as you kill you get killed, not from outside, inside." and impostor was no more.
Civillization
[
]
after 20,000 yrs, the civillazation began to grow, crewmates build houses, skyscrapers, computers, even UFOs! but impostors werent happy, then began the war beetween crewmates and impostors, every time crewmates goed to space, one of them were an impostor, the impostors were sent to kill all of them, but if the impostors were caught they died probably.
The War Doesnt Ends
[
]
The War began, then a game called "among us" were created by people in a universe which apparently called LBX-12, they build the game on earth, then people got addicted to it, then even started wikis like among us wiki or among us fictional entities wiki! god were surprised, crewmates and impostors wanted to get revenge, even now, some impostors try building a stronger ufo to get through the universe cosmic cosmo, if they do, we are doomed.

Conversations beetween impostors to kill humans
[
]
IMPOSTOR A: we should build a lightning bolt fast enough to go through their verse cosmic cosmo, then destroy them
IMPOSTOR B: i think we should actually get revenge by hand and build a ufo to kill them with hands, then they will know who killed them
quarter impostors: AGREE
sixth impostors: MOST PICKED LIGHTNING BOLT, its also easier instead of a by-hand revenge, so we should
then everyone even impostor B agrees and says: LETS DO THIS, the bolt is still coming for us today, we have to somehow stop them, they are very fast.
