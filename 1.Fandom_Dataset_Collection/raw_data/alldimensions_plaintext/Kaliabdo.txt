Enemies

Kaliabdo doesn't have many enemies. But there are some:
The Unknown Fool
:  A creature holding a knife in his hand as Kaliabdo accidentally entered his haunted supermarket just to shop. When Kaliabdo saw a creature coming towards him at 35km/h, Kaliabdo took out the red Among Us impostor in Amongus to kill The Unknown fool, when the Red impostor fired 5 shots from his gun, The Unknown fool started doing a Rick Roll dance while punching the bullets coming towards him until he got 1m away from Kaliabdo and the soldiers guarding Kaliabdo came to escape from that planet of TPOL because TuF was going to hit the planet 50 times and it would explode.
The Infinite Traveler:  He is also a dimension-traveling being who transformed Kaliabdo on the planet Seriphica into an Among Us one using an unknown substance. He kidnapped Kaliabdo and went to that planet using Glitchonicite
When Wenda ate Kaliabdo in phase 1üíÄ
Wenda

He stop it
,
The Second Coming

The Nirvanian
. But they were all lower than Wenda Sprunki because she was in the above¬†???th Layer and they were all lower than her except The
Nirvanian
. But The Nirvanian responded to Kaliabdo, and erases her from the existence, but Wenda used Uno Reverse and The Nirvanian disappeared, then Wenda ate Kaliabdo and luckily Kaliabdo had some
