Description
[
]
M-864 is just like our
universe
, Almost like a parallel universe, that's because it IS a parallel universe, but it seems
way
too similar to be one, but as usually, something ain't right. There's a whole new
galaxies
,
stars
,
planets
,
star systems
,
elements
, and even star types! the rest is just the same as our universe, Kardashev scale 4 and 93 billion lightyears large, that stuff.
M-864 is made by my OC[Meg the Megalodon] and there are many more characters in there (Brittany the Kitsune, Bob the HORRIBLE scripting Guy, Albert the Master scripter, Luna the Hedgehog, Venus the Hedgehog, Antimatter the Blackhole Spider, Matter the
White hole
Spider, Blobby the Little Slime, Riley the Hedgehog, and much more!)

M-864 is a super-void! That means it is a very big and empty void, having only 0.00000000000001% of its volume taken up by matter, and the 'matter' in it is just a very small amount of words, or just a single template. Fill in the super-void by
