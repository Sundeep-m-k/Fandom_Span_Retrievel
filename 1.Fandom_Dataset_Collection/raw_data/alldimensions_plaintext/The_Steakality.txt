The
Steakality
is an infinite-sized
verse
(or reality) contained by our
Metareality-Web
which contains an infinite amount of steak.
The steak in question never seems to go bad, is always fresh, and is universally described as being one of the best things ever eaten, no matter what their preference is normally. The steak is always processable by one's body, always being safe to eat. It is unknown how this is done. In all other aspects, though, the steak is the same exact thing as the steak here on
Earth
.
Entities
[
]
There exists some
entities
in the Steakality. Here is an abridged list of some entities.
Steakman
[
]
Steakmen are superficially identical to regular
humans
, though their body is made up of a substance similar to steak (hence their name), and their blood is grease and fat. They are almost always hunting for cows, but when they are not, they are either sleeping, or doing
the Ritual
.
The Ritual
[
]
When a group of steakmen have gathered at least 15 kilograms of meat from cows, they will do the following things,
They will set up a large tent.
They will bring all of the gathered meat into the tent.
Everyone evacuates the tent.
A red light suddenly eminates from the tent, which slowly turns brown.
Once the light is brown, the steakmans will enter the tent and bring out chunks of steak. At this point, the steak is indistinguishable from the steak making up the Steakality.
They will set the steak down in a seemingly random pattern around the tent.
They pack up the tent and go elsewhere.
Cows
[
]
Cows are identical to cows on
Earth
. No matter what, they seem to be in a constant state of distress, and will run away from anything coming near it. Steakmans hunt them to perform
the Ritual
.
