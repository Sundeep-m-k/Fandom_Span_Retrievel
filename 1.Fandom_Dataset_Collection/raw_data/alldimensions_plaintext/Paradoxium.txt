About
[
]
Paradoxium
is an
omni-
god
who usually hangs around in his personal
realm
, simply known as the
Paradoxium realm
. Paradoxium is known for his immense power.
Origins
[
]
The true origins of Paradoxium are unknown (only available related data being that he first appeared ~58750
OYC
ago), but it is possible that he is an embodiment of all paradoxes (hence his name), despite his lack of age and power compared to other
entities
of the
Wikiverse
.
His lack of origins does NOT mean we don't know anything about his past, though, as part of
his backstory
IS known.
Power
[
]
The power of Paradoxium is growing exponentially. For example, it's theorized that in 10 OYC, he will have grown 280% more powerful.
The reason for this growth in strength, like his origins, is unknown, but probably because of an artificial amp caused by a
TOG
.
And, as a reference for his current power, if he wanted to he could completly destroy an entity such as
Uber
in 35 minutes.
