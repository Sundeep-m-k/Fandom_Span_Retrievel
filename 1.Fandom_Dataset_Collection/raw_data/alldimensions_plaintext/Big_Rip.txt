A
Big Rip
occurs when a
Universe
is at the end of its life time. In this scenario,
dark matter
wins over and begins repelling everything in the universe, overtaking gravity exponentially. First,
local groups
and galaxy
superclusters
get pulled apart. Then
clusters
,
galaxies
and
filaments
get dissolved. After that,
star systems
, then individual
stars
and
planets
. Afterwards, the individual
atoms
in the molecular structure get ripped apart, turning into
Elementary particles
, untile everything is an extremely thin soup of quarks, gluons and photons. Then, some scientis theorize even these elementary particles may break down and decay, until the expansion accelerates to infinity, and literally nothing exists.
