Kretonil (/kre ton il/ or /kr…õt  …ôn …™l/)
[
]
Kretonil is a metallic substance which has been known for having different properties based on the verse it was harvested from. In its "default" state, it shares most of its properties with heatrit,* aside from its trademark heat resistance. Base kretonil is also notably brittle and poor for alloys, most being renowned for its varying properties and scientific applications.

What exactly is it and its properties?
[
]
Its atomic makeup, in short. Kretonil atoms are remarkably different from "conventional" atoms, being made of noticeably more protons than neutrons. Some of the space that neutrons would be presumed to fill is made of collections of electron-based particles known as
negatrons
instead, leading to the material disintegrating into Oltrinum under positive magnetism and Retrinium under negative magnetism.
Why do some of its properties change from verse to verse?
[
]
Kretonil has
primordium theta
B orbit clouds in place of electron orbit clouds. Due to the nature of Primordium Theta, its properties vary verse-to-verse noteably. "Base" or "default" kretonil is kretonil with the theta B particles removed.
Why is it remarked for its scientific applications?
[
]
Kretonil is one of the most abundant sources of negatrons and primordium theta in all of reality, and it also makes for good experiments on what type of objects produce what types of magnetism, and with what intensity. It is also useful in researching the interactions between it, Oltrinum, and Retrinium,** and the potenial applications of those materials.
*read

to understand what heatrit is.
**the page for these materials isn't made yet lol.
