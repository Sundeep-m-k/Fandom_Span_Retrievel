The Orasverse is a
verse
that may contain the
Mandelbrotverse
. Like the Mandelbrotverse, it is full of stew/soup/liquid whatever you wanna call it. It's official name is "Orasfluid" although the public calls it "ORA".  The point is it is soup and is drinkable. It is actually quite nice to drink because it tastes like perfectly prepared melted chocolate, although it looks like melted silver and aluminium mixed together, therefore many creatures live in this verse. Orasfluid is also an efficient fuel.
Types
[
]
There are 3 types of Orasverses. They are classified on which color they are and how dense they are. The darker the denser.
Type 1
[
]
Type 1 Orasverses are the least dense of the Orasverses and are typically pearl white in color. They have a density of 1gm per cm
2
although it can vary in each direction by 5 gm and are the most pleasant of the Orasverses.
Type 2
[
]
Type 2 Orasverses are darker in color( typically gun metal grey ) than the Type 1 Orasverses. They are more dense and are typically around 200gm per cm
2
, although it can vary in each direction by 5 gm. They are very uncomfortable to live in but it is doable to live there. Many species of extremophile live here.
Type 3
[
]
Type 3 Orasverses are very dark and compressed. They have a density of a crushing ωgm per cm
2
and absolutely nothing can live any further than 2 meters in the verse due to the pressure. These Orasverses are drained to export Orasfluid( the chocolate tasting mixture inside) to other nations in the
LUA
by
Terabithia
,
Petoria
and other major nations, with a few minor exporters.
