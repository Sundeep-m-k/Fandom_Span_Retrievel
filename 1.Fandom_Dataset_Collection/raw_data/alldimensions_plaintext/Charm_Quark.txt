The
charm quark
,
charmed quark
or
c quark
(from its symbol, c) is the third-most massive of all
quarks
, a type of
elementary particle
. Charm quarks are found in
hadrons
, which are subatomic particles made of quarks. Examples of hadrons containing charm quarks include the J/ψ meson (J/ψ), D mesons (D), charmed Sigma baryons (Σ
c
), and other charmed particles.
It, along with the
strange quark
, is part of the second generation of matter, and has an electric charge of +

Like all
quarks
, the charm quark is an
elementary
fermion
with spin

, and experiences all four fundamental interactions:
gravitation
,
electromagnetism
, weak interactions, and strong interactions. The
antiparticle
of the charm quark is the
charm antiquark
(sometimes called anticharm quark or simply anticharm), which differs from it only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.
The charm quark contains a

The Anti-Charm Quark, Charm Antiquark or just Anticharm is the exact same thing as an Charm Quark, except the charge is negative, so the Anti-Down Quark just has a charge of -

A charm quark decays into an
Strange Quark
and a
W
+
Boson
, which is short lived, and decays into an
positron
and an
Electron neutrino
. An example of this decay is the decay of a D
+
particle. It lives only 10
-12
seconds! When it decays, it forms a K
-
Kaon
(This is that particle that decays into a strange quark). It also creates a π
0
, π
+
, a
positron
and an
Electron neutrino
. The charm quark also has a 5% chance to decay into a
Down Quark
instead.
