Blueprint gene of an
up quark
Blueprint genes are sets of
blueprint particles
that are present within all
elementary particles
and dictate their properties. All of the blueprint particles are in a binary state ("on" or "off"). These genes are written in the most efficient binary language logically possible, although nobody yet has been able to decipher this language. The more mass a particle has, the larger its blueprint gene. However, the blueprint gene is not the only place where there are blueprint particles in other particles. They're found within
Preprimordium Particles
.
Mutation
[
]
Blueprint genes are very hard to change, but it is possible to change a blueprint gene by a process called quantum mutation.
Mutated particles
will have different properties than their normal counterpart. Here is a list of mutations the particle can get:
More mass (M+)
Less mass (M-)
Positive charge (C2+)
Negative charge (C2-)
Stronger charge (C+)
Weaker charge (C-)
Charge removal (CZ)
Positive spin (S2+)
Negative spin (S2-)
More spin (S+)
Less spin (S-)
Spin removal (SZ)
Higher lifetime (L+)
Lower lifetime (L-)
Complete stability (LÎ©)
More hadron compatibility (H+)
Less hadron compatibility (H-)
