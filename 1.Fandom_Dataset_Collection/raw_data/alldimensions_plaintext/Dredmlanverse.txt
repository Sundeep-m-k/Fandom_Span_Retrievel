The
Dredmlanverse
is a verse suspended in the middle of the
Absoverse
, where majority of life is contained.
It hangs in the air, balanced between the
Blaychamaverse
and
Puiettabverse
due to their
immense gravitational forces
.
The verse itself acts as a
barrier
, a shield from the
oncoming attackers
. When the
Blaychamaverse
rings its mighty hits, the strength it gives to the
Dredmlanverse
enpowers it, enabling its barriers and barricades
.
Once the
Puiettabverse
starts to roll, it
saves and conserves everything within it
. The surface starts to emit a
strong, white glare on its surface
. This is the signal that shows everyone what is about to unravel, to
get prepared for oncoming events
.
The barrier is comprised out of
complex technology, mechanics
and
algorithms that only contain meaning to the divine
. To the omniscient and quasi-omniscient, to those who built and those who
heavily studied it
.
