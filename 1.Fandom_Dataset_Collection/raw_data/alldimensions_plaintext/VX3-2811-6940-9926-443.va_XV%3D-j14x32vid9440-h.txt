Introduction
[
]
VX3
for short is a
verse
that consists of a very large
maze
full of stuff, which also makes it very hard to survive in the unpruper areas due to the amount of hazards. The
multiverse
it is in is pretty much devoid of other things besides this verse, meaning it barely has external contact with other verses.
Local life
[
]
Humans
are some of the main
beings
within this verse. Not only humanoids, but ACTUAL humans for some reason. There's at the very least around 350k of them in this verse, which is an oddly small amount since even
our
planet
has way more than that. It has been observed that the human
civilizations
within it have technology comparable to the bronze age, and they mostly gather
materials
from the maze itself. More
lifeforms
will be talked about in the next sections.
Origins
[
]
The origin of this verse is unknown, so by default it was most likely
made
by a
TOG
due to its randomized properties. It received its name by the scientists that discovered it, being given due to the same aforementioned reasons.
Censorship
[
]
Most knowledge about this verse is hidden from the public, due to undisclosed reasons.
Largest discovered groups
[
]
These will be ranked from largest to smallest. Humans in this verse mostly work by themselves, so even the largest groups aren't that large compared to the total population.
The "vek group", of 161 people and 2 dogs. They have a base at a big empty area of the verse.
The "caj group", of 122 people and 1 dog. They also have a base at the same empty area, but on the other side of it. They seem to be allied with the vek group, so the chance of both eventually uniting into one is likely.
The "nali group", of only 61 people located in a random location.
The "kavi group", of only 32 people and 16 cats. Cats are treated as leaders, thus the high amount of them.
The "truth group", [redacted].
Relevant locations
[
]
The "big empty area" where both the vek and caj groups can be found at. It is a pocket of land that has an area of around 17 squared kilometers.
The "tower". Like its name indicates, it is a big tower-like structure that reaches a horizontal wall at the top of what is discovered. land above this area has yet to be found.
The "dimensional rift", [REMOVED].
Attempted expeditions
[
]
All of them resulted in failure, but they can still be mentioned anyways.
The
Obamaverse
expedition. It happened in 62
OYC
, in which 8 obama prisms and 2 obama cones were sent in a spaceship to see what this verse's age was. They were found dead on the edge of the wall inside their ship, presumably due to them crashing into the walls.
The
Crustacianverse
expedition. It happened in 83 OYC, and in which 63 crabs were put on a spaceship and landed safely inside the aforementioned big empty area, in which they were greeted by the vek and caj groups and invited to join then. Of course, they refused and continued to venture deeper in the maze until they went missing. 0 bodies have been recovered.
The Second Obamaverse expedition. It happened in 97 OYC, in which 17 obama spheres, 19 obama prisms, and 7 obama cones were put in a spaceship to see what's above the tower. When they reached the top of the tower, the ship exploded and killed everyone in the ship again. No bodies have been found, however pieces of the ship have been recovered.
The Second Crustacianverse expedition. It happened in 111 OYC and it failed too, but they did get to take a "stickman" to the Crustacianverse where it now lives (they duplicated it and put the clone back into VX3-2811-6940-9926-443.va_XV=-j14x32vid9440-h. It was a failure because most of the crew members were killed on landing. Also, 16 of them were killed by bear traps and hostile entities, and the crabs were really weak so they were unable of fighting back.
Layers system
[
]
Each layer is harder than the previous and is also either same size or bigger.
Layer 1: Snow. This layer has little to no entities in it and it has many materials which are relatively common, such as snow and rocks.
Layer 0: Snowy Rock. This layer has a few more entities (around 20% more) and has rarer materials.
Layer -1: Flooded Caverns. This layer has around 65% more entities than Snow and has more materials, yet they are rarer.
Layer -2: Dark Caves. This layer has 2x entities and less materials. There are also 19 vending machines which have infinite stock for some reasons. This is where bear traps start spontaneously appearing.
Layer -3: Foggy Caves. This layer has 2.15x entities and only 6 vending machines, but they do have better food. Materials are a bit scarcer. Past this point, you will need a bright flashlight.
Layer -4: The Depths. This layer has 3.5x entities and only 2 vending machines across it. It has better and more common materials, however you need a very powerful flashlight to see (at the very least 60W).
Layer -5: The Abyss. This layer has 3.75x entities and 150 vending machines, however they all have worse food and it has very scarce and well hidden materials.
Layer -6: The Void. This layer has 4.6x entities and 0 vending machines, however there are 25 exits across it that let you return to higher layers. Materials are uncommon.
Layer -7: The Unknown. This layer has 5.55x entities and only 2 vending machines, but there are only 2 exits. This layer is very dark, requiring  a flashlight of at least 225W of power to be able to see to the end of a hallway. Materials are super scarce, and you need a strong pickaxe to mine these ores.
Layer -8: The Deep Dark Depths. This layer has 7.5x entities and 1 vending machine, but it gives lots of food and drinks. Materials are common here and it requires a flashlight of at least 350W to be able to see.
Layer -9: The Underworld. This layer has 9.99x entities and also 1 vending machine, but it still gives lots of food and drinks. Materials are rare here, and it requires a flashlight of at least 555W to be able to see.
Layer -10: The Mines. This layer has 3x entities and 900 vending machines. Materials are incredibly common but the entities are dangerous. There are also artificial lights that let you see better.
Layer -11: Column Columns. This layer has 10x entities and many vending machines, but it is incredibly dark. There are giant columns everywhere which have useful materials at the tops of them. There are only two exits.
Types of creatures / devices
[
]
Humans. Self explanatory.
"Crushers": black humanoid entities that are very tall and have 3 fingers on each hand. They are very dangerous and are around 8 feet and 6 inches tall. They are hostile to humans and they're able of crushing their bones until the victims are killed, and then they eat their flesh, just to then somehow erase their bodies from existence. What they do to remove the bodies is unknown, though. They have a top running speed of 60 km/h, however you can hide from them easily due to their bad hearing and eyesight.
Shadows: black entities that usually take the form of a dog, cat, or a human. They look normal from a distance but as you get closer to them, they turn translucent and their color changes to vantablack. They have a top running speed of 45 km/h and are strong enough to shred bones. The only way to survive these is to hide or outrun them and lose them. Not even crushers are able of defeating them in an 1v1 scenario.
Coneheads: small semi-humanoid entities of only around 2 feet in height. They are all black just like the previous entities, however they can emit a red light too. They kill by charging victims from across corridors until they die. To avoid these, you simply need to not look at  them, since they only chase you after you look at them once.
Bear traps: just bear traps. Not really creatures, but they do possess a threat level, as they can trap you and alert entities of your presence.
Rock monsters: large humanoid entities that run slowly at only 10 km/h, yet they do camouflage and are also very strong. Not much else is known about them.
Stickmen: tall and very thin humanoid entities that run very fast at 110 km/h, but they have bad eyesight so they only see other entities at around 21% of the time. They're also not that strong and can only lift 16 lbs of weight (tested).
The Miners: very dangerous entities that have pickaxes and can see in infrared, visible light, and x-ray. They can only be found in mines within the maze and will often kill people and steal their stuff, allowing for them to create machines that they use to mine more things and kill more people, because for some reason they are good at engineering. However, people stuck in mines will often steal their pickaxes to mine for stuff. There is a war going on with the people stuck here and the miners, all in one layer.
