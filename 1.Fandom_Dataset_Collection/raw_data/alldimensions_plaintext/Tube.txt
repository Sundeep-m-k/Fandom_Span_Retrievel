A
tube
is a two-dimensional surface constructed by creating a prism with a hollow
circle
as the base. It can also be considered as a two-dimensional version of the
torus
constructed by stretching a
line segment
in a ring.
Another way to construct it topologically is to take a sphere and then remove two disjoint open discs.
A tube can also be embedded in a two dimensional plane. This less symmetric embedding is called an
annulus
.
