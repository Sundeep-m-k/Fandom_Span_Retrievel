The
Universe of Greatness
is a vast cosmological structure which, containing many
Galaxies of Greatness
, is known for having a constantly moist environment and plenty of carbon dioxide. This comes from a glowing ball in the middle of the densest of Great Galaxy omegaclusters, something to be described later. The core, as with many matter producing and destroying oddities, is not known to have a specific source. Other, very bright but hardly as functional versions of the core run throughout the Universe of Greatness. These are simply unactivated backups, giving a bit extra to the weirdly isolated Galaxies of Greatness.
GoG Clustering Systems
[
]
The Universe of Greatness is, as most likely noted, home to an absolutely massive amount of Galaxies of Greatness. The amount is staggeringly more then a normal universe to its typical galaxies, so here's a rundown of its size. Take a GoG cluster, a gathering of
CAI
GoGs. This is the basic cluster. Repeat for
this
cluster of GoGs to get a supercluster. Repeat again for a hypercluster. Repeat yet again for a quad, quint, sext, sept, etc. cluster. Eventually they just get to "70-GoGcluster" and other numbers. This repeats for omega times until  you get to omega + 1, the Universe of Greatness.
