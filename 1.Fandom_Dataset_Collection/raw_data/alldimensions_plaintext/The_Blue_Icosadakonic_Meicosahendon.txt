The
Blue Icosadakonic Meicosahendons
are the 'colorswapped' version of
the Icosadakonic Meicosahendons
, similar to how
the Pentatopic Duetriacontaterons
and
Green Pentatopic Duetriacontaterons
relate to each other, being built off of the previous verse and are of a single color, but the same shape.
Properties
[
]
Similar to how the previous verse has colors which each have similar properties to
Primordium Particles
, of which the blue objects has similar properties to
Primordium Sigma
. Because of this, the
entirety
of The Blue Icosadakonic Meicosahendon acts almost exactly like a gigantic Primordium Sigma.
