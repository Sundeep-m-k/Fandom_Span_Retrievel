Tiny Axions
are the 2nd-smallest kind of
Axions
which carry out theorems from primordial axioms. This setups the non-abstract concepts, including connections and containment, which is carried through by higher-scale Axions.
There are almost infinite phases of Tiny Axions, one for each proof. Due to rigorous proofs for basic concepts and complexity built from basic things, the purpose for every phase is unknown. Because it is abstractly tiny compared to Small Axions, the sequence starts to be more alien and less linear.
Logic
[
]
Logic is built on binary predicates, true or false. Concentration is the most basic operator built by Tiny Axions, use to combine predicates to assume basic objects like numbers, functions, and sets. The most common one is sets, which are first-priority to Tiny Axions.
The most primordial logic is predicate logic, with sets and basic axioms only being used. They are evolved into less-abstract logic since then, with the carryover to Small Axions by abstract connections. Axiom of Extensibility from
Micro-Axions
is then used, which begins "meta-mathematical" proofs.
NAND
[
]
NAND logic is commonly seen as the main predicate logic gate, because it's functional-completeness. That means other logic gates are expressed in only NAND logic gates, making it a primordial seed for axioms and has a short expression of 5 Tiny Axioms.
"True" predictate, however, requires a long expression of Tiny Axioms with NAND combinatorics, which states that true is NOT false; and false is NOT true. Most axiologists state that truth predicates are the first steps leading to
Mathon
's mathematics. Some states that "containment of sets" is one of these steps, but requires nestings and layer connections.
Numbers
[
]
Numbers are built in a meta-mathematical way, in which addition requires a long expression. Signs and imaginary numbers, however, require more understandings to numbers, which is thought by
Small Axions
.
Dimensions require a product matrix of multiple sets of numbers, which has coordinates and uses a lot of well-ordering axioms. This is also used to setup containment by regions of "dimensions," and how it contains in any form of dimensionality and laws.
