History
[
]
Geraldson was born through pure chance by quantum flucuations in our
Omniverse
in Ω BOYC. He had only 0.1
pows
back then. He started consuming the elementary particles he came across because they were tasty, and he started rapidly increasing his power. At the end of 1 OYC, he already had 10 pows, and after 2 OYC, he had 100. After 20 OYC, he had consumed enough
thuons
that he gained low-level space manipulation. He used this ability to create an organ within his body that duplicates particles and makes him even more powerful.
