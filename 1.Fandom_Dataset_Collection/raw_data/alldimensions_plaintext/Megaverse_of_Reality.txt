The
Megaverse of Reality
is a big cube that contains the
Multiverse of Reality
. Again, there is a fractal at the center, but the Multiverse of Reality doesn't stay at the center of each repeating fractal. Instead, it floats around randomly throughout the Megaverse's outer areas. I'll refer to the Multiverse of Reality as MUoR.
The life here is also much more advanced. They also live in the outer areas. They use the occasional Multiverse of Reality that passes by to get a heck ton of energy. Some of this life has colonized parts of the MUoR. They are known as the
Even More Outsiders
.
One thing that is interesting about the fractal in the center is that the whole thing has absolutely no life, and it is seemingly impossible to find the center of it. This fractal is also a different shape than The Fractal found inside the MUoR.
The dimensions can also vary. The dimensions change every 42 seconds. The range of dimensions able to be chosen is technically less. The meaning of the number '42' is not well understood by the Even More Outsiders. Many humans know what this is referring to, though.
