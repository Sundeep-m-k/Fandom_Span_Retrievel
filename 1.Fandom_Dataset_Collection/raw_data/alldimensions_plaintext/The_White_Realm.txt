Structure
[
]
The White Realm has been reported to resemble a void which strangely enough, has a white color. The White Realm does not seem to have any actual matter or even laws, making it very chaotic. The White Realm is also missing a lot of key properties, such as color, shape, or EUSI due to it being so far away.
Creatures
[
]
Creatures have been observed inside The White Realm. These creatures are very odd, behaving much like entities within
The Chasms
. They do not seem to be solid, and will break up into large pieces and generate hundreds of fractal structures if interacted with. Each of these fractal structures will disappear after 3 ~ 7 minutes after first created.
These creatures do not seem to have any sort of higher-level thinking, and can only perform very rudimentary tasks such as moving, turning, or bending.
