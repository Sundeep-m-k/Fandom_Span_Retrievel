Species
Primordial Entity
Waxon
is a very strong type of being known as a
Primordial Entity
, although it is one of if not the weakest of these entities. They are a very unorganized and chaotic being, wishing prosperity unto others but often incurring wrath. They were supposed to represent PEACE and TEAMWORK in the
Primordialverse
, but they instead had to go to the depths of a random universe to bide their time with
Wanon
, their much more 'chill' ally and brother. Although
THE CREATOR
considers the duo their ally, the feeling is very one-sided, as Waxon has a deep distaste for the
Primordial
and his doings, along with his creations and allies. Waxon wishes to change everything to be calmer, livelier with more inhabited planets and nations without conflict, a waxing world without waning to go with his nature of ambition in creation, to keep everything happy.
