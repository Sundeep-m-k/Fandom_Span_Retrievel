Falling Down is a large infinite sized verse known to have infinite gravity, but only in a specific direction, making the "bottom" of this verse impossible to escape, which is why it was called Falling Down.
The "bottom"
[
]
The "bottom" of this verse is where all of its content exists, because the gravity only pulls there. The "bottom" has a gravitational pole to it, which means it has a force that pulls everything toward one of its sides, but not the other.
Emptiness
[
]
Falling Down has no content except at the "bottom" because of the force, so everywhere else is empty. Therefore, the rest of this verse is nothing but a force, which doesn't really exist, so the force is not being pulled down by force.
Where the force brings them
[
]
Since the gravity is so high, it can crush any material it brings to the "bottom" because of the infinite force, so the "bottom" doesn't appear to have anything on it.
