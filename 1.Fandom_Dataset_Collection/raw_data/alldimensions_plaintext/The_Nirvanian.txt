There are some stronger known beings beyond the Post-Loop level such as the
Rabbits
.
↑
Knowledge about all things, including things that transcend it.
↑
Similar to Post-Loop Verses, but instead of transcending the loops, the loops transcend them. They use the Pre-Loop Size Index (PreLSI), where a higher number means the verse is smaller.
↑
A lower PreLSI means a verse is bigger.

Our own loop.
