About
[
]
TARDIGRADE 10501
is one of the largest
universes
ever discovered, only behind
Tremendous-1500
.
Entities
aren't sure why this
verse
is so huge compared to the average ones, being larger than even an average sized
Multiverse
. This means a quite large Multiverse like
PEWLEW 6784
is needed to contain it.
Like we formerly mentioned, this verse is so large, it is actually in a larger than an average sized multiverse, but the multiverse it is in actually has a strange structure. This universe is like the "core" of it since it is so gigantic, and the other universes seem to orbit quickly around it. Its pretty much the equivalent of an universe-scaled
solar system
.
Size theories
[
]
The most popular theory to why this universe being so big is because it collided and fused with many other universes. This could be true since this wouldn't be the first instance of verses colliding with eachother before, making the resulting one much larger, but there would have to be a lot of universes to collide with each other since this universe is just so big.
Another possible reason would be that this was inflated. This would also be a very good explanation, but this one, by calculations, is far too young to inflate, thus rendering the theory as quite unprobable, though not discarded by any means.
Structure
[
]
This universe is pretty similar to the average one in its design. The main difference is that its cosmic webs are just larger. There's roughly a proportionally similar amount of
planets
,
stars
and
galaxies
, just more spaced out.
The other main difference is that there's a
white hole
in the middle of this universe, which is unusual, but other than that, it is still a pretty standard universe other than its size.
