Asteroids
[
]
As shown in the picture, Sentialus-Ports will occasionally shoot asteroids out of themselves that will move at a high speed into the Sentialusexotiansverse beyond, where they explode. These also contain several parasitic life forms known as Asseribusfalcerperians. These, if given the time before the asteroid explodes, will rapidly grow and develop tools that will allow them to escape and fly to other Verses.
