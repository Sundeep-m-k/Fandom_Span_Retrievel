Structure
[
]
100232 is a relatively empty verse, with not a lot of stars, planets, or galaxies. Due to how 100232 was expanding very fast for a long period of time, all the contents of 100232 are spread very far from each other. Most planets in 100232 are rogue planets, many stars are very old, and galaxies are a rare occurrence.
Symbolic Importance
[
]
The Entrigeri view 100232 as a sacred verse, due to it being their first real home. Before, 100232 was viewed by some Entrigeri as a literal god, and many objects/artifacts were scattered everywhere in 100232 as offerings.
Many of these objects have markings on it which seem to be an extremely ancient language. This language is
not
the Entrigeri language.

side. There are 8 markings on the gray side. 5 of these markings have a known meaning, with the markings reading, "this object is [unknown] the divine [unknown] [unknown]."
The second object discovered in 100232. It is a stone composed of mainly titanium and a very small bit of
Primordium Alpha
. This stone is shaped like an octahedron, and once again has markings. These markings are slightly different, but seem to mean the same thing as the markings on the first object.
The third object discovered in 100232. It is a gray-colored sphere which is hollow.
The fourth object discovered in 100232. It is shaped like a tetrahedron, and the first object found which has has the Old Entrigeri language written on it. However, the text does not seem to have any coherent message/meaning.
