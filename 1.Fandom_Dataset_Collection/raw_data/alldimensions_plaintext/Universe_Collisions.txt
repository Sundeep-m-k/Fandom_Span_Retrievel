Our
Multiverse
, along with others of the same kind, consist of millions and millions of closed-ended
Universes
. Most of them contain the same dimensionality (3-dimensional, in order to be specific) as
ours
, but have different sizes and Euclidean-based topologies, ranging from 50 billion light years to 200 billion light years. The universes aren't currently moving, so the only way to naturally collide with another Universe is via inflation, although this only happens in scenarios related to the formation and destruction of Universes.
This page contains 3 speeds of collisions to give further information.

Soft collisions: Slow inflationary rate, up to 90 Mly per second
[

If a universe collided with another at a soft collision rate, they would just bounce away and feel nothing happened.

Nothing is interesting when multiple universes hit each other, but...
If many universes hit another universe, all at a soft collision rate, then the universe that is hitten will be distorted. Eventually, universes that are distorted too much will be devolved into Level-2
chained verses
of 2 smaller parallel universes each.
Hard collisions: Fast inflationary rate, 90 Mly - 1 Gly per second
[
]
If a universe collided with another at a hard collision rate, new gravitational singularities will be produced from the point where they hit each other, causing the creation of new universes with shared laws.
There is a low chance that objects may intersect from those universes. It is dependent on how they are parallel universes.
Parallel
: Those objects will just be in opposing universes.
Not parallel
: Those objects will be glitched out from opposing universes, causing them to become dissolved into a substance with dark energy included. That means those universes will have faster inflationary rates.

Many universes hitting each other with hard collision rates will cause a Big Rip scenario (
YK-Type
Universe Destruction level), leading to the result of new gravitational singularities.
Intense collisions: Rapid inflationary rate, > 1 Gly per second
[
]
Universe collisions with intense rates always let all objects intersect. Some objects will escape out of universes, but they will be dissolved by the law of multiversal space.
Parallel
: They will become a level-3
Chained Verse
. Sometimes it will create
universe sections
.
Not parallel
:
Big Rip
to those universes.

Parallel
: A
Small Universe Cluster
, made with several
Chained Verses
.
Not parallel
: A massive singularity that is merged from lots and lots of gravitational singularities. It forms chaotic, broken universes over time, but slowly collapsing at a steady rate. Like
Black Holes
, close universes will be sucked into that singularity, making that bigger. When it collapses, it produces a
Small Universe Cluster
with chaotic laws.
This is the most dangerous one, as it causes a
YK-Type
Sub-Multiverse Destruction scenario.
Hyper Collisions: Ultra-Rapid Inflationary Rate, > 15 Gly per second
[
]
Universe collisions with hyper rates always let all objects intersect. most objects will escape out of universes, but they will be dissolved by the law of multiversal space. later a few smaller explosions might happen.
Parallel
: They will become a level-4 but it will be a messy chained verse.
Not parallel
:
Big Rip
to those universes.
Trivia
[
]
If a new universe was formed, then all universes that are really close to it would be affected with intense collisions.
