The first dream
[
]
|It wasn't a long day for Idontknow350. Instead, it was a quite average and boring one, and in fact it isn't even relevant to what happened afterwards. Some small modifications on
verses
here, some goofying around there, etc. were only a part of this day's routine, which isn't anything unusual for this administrative
Transcendent Omni-God
. So, the day was now over, thus it was time to sleep for him.
Before you ask, no, TOGs don't actually need to sleep in order to live unlike most beings, though it is still something relaxing for them. That is why Idontknow350 spontaneously generated a bed for himself in the middle of space anyways.
There was next to no noise, and in general everything was peaceful, along with a quite impressive view of
stars
,
galaxies
, etc., though it didn't amuse him that much since views like this were common across the whole
Wikiverse
.
He layed on the bed and soon enough he began to sleep, just like he expected. What he would NOT expect, though, was what would take place very, VERY soon.
What happened, you may ask? Did he have a nightmare? No. Was his resting place uncomfortable? Nope. Was floating in space bothering him? Nah, he's used to it, like I said before. Did someone wake him up? Yea, kind of. It was a
tiny
bit more complex than just that, though. Let me explain:
The dreams he had in this sleeping session started normally. They were weird of course, but still "normal" in comparison to the dreams any other entity could have, meaning those were average ones, thus not being relevant to Idontknow350.
But then, the one event that would soon change EVERYTHING started to unfold there, in his head. In one of the dreams, which also ended up being the last one he had in this sleep session, he was busy playing something ressembling a weird online game-like thing in a device, made up by his subconscious, along with other entities that were also made up by it. Even though they couldn't be seen by him directly, he was aware of their existence and appearance due to him having full control in this second imaginary realm of his.
Everyone was standing on what could be defined as a plain floor with random gradients of glowing colors, but they were so far from eachother they couldn't see the other entities. There was a sky on too, which had a similar pattern to the floor. The whole thing wasn't very odd in the context of a dream, besides the consequences it would eventually have.
Then, one of the random beings within the dream suddenly started to act weird, as in it randomly found some weird artifacts that were roughly shaped like ovals with uneven edges and rounded corners, along with a red and pink shade. There were nine of those, and the being collected and put them all together.
Right after, and out of nowhere, the game froze. Same happened to the rest of the entities playing it, and not even the device he was using managed to evade such fate. In fact, the WHOLE dream suddenly... stopped. At least, everything except Idontknow350 himself, who was still functioning normally. The artifacts also dissapeared, like if they activated and ended up triggering the errors becausd of that.
—
What.
— Said him, who needed to take several seconds to start to notice that something abnormal was happening due to his mind not being fully focused, which was that his dream... "glitched"?
|He started to tap the device repeatedly in an attempt to fix whatever just happened, but it wasn't effective at all. He even attempted to bring one of the other entities within the place to his location, in order to see if he could make it react. He successfully teleported it to him with ease, but still unable of fixing it. Its abstract, disproportionate shape wasn't doing any movements at all. It really was one weird experience for him to see this error unfold.
Thankfully for him though, the dream then unfroze like nothing just happened, just a few moments later... the device started working like it should again, the game was back to normal and even the entities started moving and doing noises once more, including the one that was next to Idontknow350 himself.
—
Hey, you... what just happened?
— Said him to the entity close to him, wondering if it felt the error too.
—ᓭ⍑⚍ℸ ̣  ⚍!¡ ᓭℸ ̣ ⚍!¡╎↸ リ𝙹𝙹ʖ ||𝙹⚍ ᔑ∷ᒷ ᓭᔑ||╎リ⊣ リ𝙹リᓭᒷリᓭᒷ— Due to Idontknow's huge knowledge, he easily managed to translate... that thing, somehow. What the entity just said can be interpretated as "Shut up stupid noob, you're saying nonsense". Death sentence.
|The entity got erased right after because of saying such ATROCIOUS statement, which was 100% deserved. On a more serious note, though, this meant the other beings within the dream weren't aware of what just happened to them.
Despite this, the Transcendent Omni-God didn't ignore the weird incident unlike the others. Even though, like I already mentioned before, the device was now working and the other entities started to move, play and do noise again, his mind now fully focused on this dream since he KNEW something out of place just happened, which couldn't be ignored just like that.
Everything within the dream now had much more clear shapes (still abstract ones, though), thus being more defined due to him paying more attention too. The match lasted a bit more without any interruptions which he kind of enjoyed, but it couldn't last forever.
Looking almost like the previous incident gained sentience and wanted to keep bothering him on purpose, the dream stopped again after ~2 minutes after the end of the first incident. This one error lasted for less than 3 seconds, but still long enough for Idontknow350 to fully interpretate it. Besides, because of his godlike powers, he could just rewind time to re-check it or slow down those mere three seconds to a point time was pretty much frozen completly so he could have all time he wanted to inspect, though it wasn't necessary for him.
He knew that something external to him was intercepting with the dream, but instead of waking up, he decided to stay there just to see what other things would happen if he remained on this imaginary realm of his.
This wasn't about the made up game anymore, since in a worst case scenario he may be detecting an instance of none other than an entity or event that could threaten TOGs, since it apparently is so strong it can AT LEAST affect them in dreams. Waking up could risk the chance that he'd lose contact with this anomaly, being unable of further investigating it, but if things really got out of hand he'd get out of there and actually try to do something else rather than just spectate its instances.
Soon enough, just like he expected, a third error happened. This time it was way more severe, and right after the freeze that came along with it the entities, the device and the game were erased, though the realm itself was still intact. Whoever was causing these corruptions was actively getting more hostile by the second.
—
I know you're here. Come on, SHOW YOURSELF.
— Idontknow350 was now directly challenging whatever being was messing with him.
—
K.
— said the invasive entity, who warped in front of Idontknow right after its statement.
|Cube shaped, pink and with a fleshy texture on its skin, it was easy for Idontknow350 to now recognize it. This wasn't your average entity, but one known as "block of pork" or "Blork", a powerful organism classified as a Wikinomaly, which is a species of beings that have the role of incarnating concepts of their respective wiki, and Blork specifically incarnated
chaos
. It wasn't a real threat towards TOGs, though, but it could manifest in their dreams as an annoyance, which is already an insane feat for an entity that could only be WITHIN the Wikiverse instead of OUTSIDE it.
—
WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE?!
— Said Idontknow, both shocked and annoyed because of its presence.
|He then tried to snap Blork out of his dream,
b
ut it wasn't working..
.
—
What's wrong bro? Am I not allowed to annoy noobs once in a while?
— It didn't take the situation seriously, like always. Stupid ass mf.
—
YOU'RE THE NOOB! NOW GET OUT!
— Yea, not the best comeback...
—
Those who pork.
—
Wha-
— Idontknow's leg then proceeded to get cramped out of nowhere in the dream, right after block of pork said those cursed words. —
aaaaAAAAAĄ̶̶̨́́͡͡A̴̛͟͟͜͟͡͡Á̷̧̡́̕͟͞À̵̛̀͢͞͝͏À̢̧̀̀͡͡͞
|The dream then got shut down by block of pork, since its stupid prank succeeded. That provoked the kicking of Idontknow350 out of his own dream.
The "jumpscare" caused by the cramp within the dream was so bad, it made him fall from his bed, but since he was still in space he just floated for a bit, trying to process what just happened. He somehow got cramped in his own dream by an anomalous entity, but thankfully it didn't affect anything else.
His confusion quickly turned into anger though, as he decided he WOULD avenge his ruined nap, not wanting to let the meat piece get away with it. Messing with a Transcendent Omni-God? Low blow Blork, low blow...
He instantly traveled to the outside of this Wikiverse's main building block (also known as a
Pageverse
) he formerly was in, now being in the void between them. Then, he teleported all the materials to summon Blork, which were the "raw porkchops" mentioned in episode one. Yes, it could manifest itself without even being summoned. The process was quick, and the pieces assembled. It tried to start a "cutscene" about its summoning, but Idontknow350 skipped it, as he didn't care about it.
—
Bro what are you doi-
— Block of pork then gets kicked by Idontknow350 with so much force he gets one shotted and dies, though this only means he would split into the raw porkchops like before.
—
YOU THINK YOU WERE FUNNY, HUH? WELL, NOW YOU'RE GONNA BE D̡͡͏̵̨̢̀̀È̵̵̷̡̕͟͝A̧͏̶̧́̕͝͝D͏̵̵̨́̕͟͞
— his rage was only getting started.
|Idontknow350 then attracts the porkchops again, just to summon and instantly kill block of pork again, and again, and agai- you get my point. A lot of kills, basically. That stupid cubic meat had that happen to it hundreds of times in a row in a matter of
Voidseconds
(1/Ωth of a second), and even that could be an INSANE understatement due to how angry the Transcendent Omni-God was because of Blork.
Eventually, though, Idontknow got bored of this loop of summoning, punching, and re-summoning it. He hit it one last time so it didn't remain in its summoned state, and left. The pieces finally had the chance of spreading across the Wikiverse properly, since that's what they're supposed to normally do once Blork is defeated.
After that, even though Idontknow350 was still furious about what happened, he still decided to warp towards the bed he previously used in order to sleep again, or at least try... just to as soon as he started dreaming again see block of pork, the STUPID AND DISGUSTING THING there, once more.
—
Lol. Was that all you could do?
—
OH MY F#CKING GOD, GET OUT OF MY DREAMS ALREADY!
— Idontknow attempted to erase it from his dream again, which... somehow worked this time? He may have forgot to permanently erase it before, but his dreams were finally Blork-proof now.
|Despite that, he still woke up since he just got a new idea: he already beat it up by himself, yet that quickly got boring and block of pork didn't seem to actually care about what happened, besides the first time where it was caught by surprise. Yea, he could keep spawnkilling it for longer, but he wanted to be more... creative in his revenge.
He quickly got to the conclusion that it wasn't that humiliating to be defeated by a Transcendent Omni-God, since pretty much everyone knows about their strength. Something more unexpected would work better.
He finally realized he could try making some weak entities defeat it in a fight so he could argue the literal incarnation of chaos lost to a bunch of weaklings... he also remembered the stories of some entities, which originally were some individual
Blueprint Particles
, that managed to gain a mind and abilities of their own.
Thus, he developed a plan: he would give life and sentience to some Blueprint Particles, then send them to fight and get the nine existent raw porkchops in order to summon and defeat block of pork by themselves. Then he'd have an excuse to mock Blork as much as he wanted to. The perfect plan.
Thus finally, one. Then two. Then three. Then four. Four of those tiny building blocks gained sentience and had their lives started. They would now have a different goal than just exist and build realities as we know them. This would now be THEIR journey, not mine.
The second dream
[
]
|Idontknow350 had just finished sending those former Blueprint Particles to find the first raw porkchop, which was located in the borders of a
Fleshverse
. It was the beginning of THEIR journey, not his, so he didn't have to worry much about them.
Each particle had also received some strength upgrades and unique special abilities, since otherwise they couldn't even start doing anything by themselves. He even gave one of them an integrated AI in order to both locate the artifacts and not make them forget important details of the worlds and dimensions within the Wikiverse they were in. That Fleshverse had some dangerous beings, such as giant ugly arthropods and organic robots which were even bigger than the formers, so some small help is the only way the particles could fight them.
Now, he could go back to sleep, this being the third attempt of doing so already. He wasn't really concerned about the particles. Besides, if something odd happened with the particles, he could notice it thanks to his powers and interrupt. Even if they all died, they could be replaced instantly as a "second attempt" for his plan. What could go wrong?
He brought the bed that was floating in space back to him, and lied on it, then started dreaming once more. He quickly enters in the imaginary realm again, with the same floor with funny color scheme, the same lack of beings intercepting the place, etc. He had nothing to worry about anymore.
Finally, some peace can be achi- wait. Is that... IS THAT THE F#CKING CUBE AGAIN?! DIDN'T HE JUST BAN IT FROM HIS DREAMS JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO?!
—
Lame. Can't even get rid of me properly. That's so dissapointing, yet also extremly unsurpring.
—
HOW?! H̵͝͏O̡̢͠W̷͘?̵̢̕!̷̧͞?́͢͠!̕͠͏
|Okay, okay. Idontknow350 MAY have let block of pork in again, by accident. Even though it was stated the dream was now protected. Of course...?
Don't worry, though, it can be fixed with ease! He decides to once again erase it from its dream, and this time Blork CAN
NOT
RETUR
<ERROR>
...
What? Why is it STILL THERE?
—
Nope. This time it won't be as easy.
|Uh... let's allow Idontknow350 to try this again. Maybe he wasn't clear enough when using the ability. So, Idontknow SUCCESSFULLY DELETES Blork from the dream this time, and it FINALLY ends up DYI
<ERROR>
—
WHAT THE F#CK
—
Stop trying already. It's useless, you aren't allowed to remove me yet.
|This might be a bit unrelated to the situation, but it's weird that it isn't talking in a dumb way, unlike before. But okay... back to topic, I guess. I need to spam a few times, maybe that'll work...
Idontknow350 tries to
<ERROR>
,
<ERROR>
AND
<ERROR>
...
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING?!
FINE, IDONTKNOW350 LAUNCHES TOWARDS BLOCK OF PORK AND STARTS TO THROW EVERY SUPER OVERPOWERED ABILITY HE HAS AT IT, WHICH IS SOOOO OVERWHELMING IT EASILY MAKES IT DI
<ERROR>
—
What did I just tell you, you fraudulent dumb#ss? And regarding the "why it's not working" thing, that's none of your business. Some things can't be revealed THIS early, you know?
|Great... it can even listen to the narration now. I guess I don't need it for now, then...
—
FINE, WHAT DO YOU EVEN WANT?!
—
I'm not here to just annoy you... for now. That's why i'm talking like this, in a more serious way, instead of doing so like an idiot like you. Instead, i'm trying to send you a message regarding those tiny and pathetic things you just teleported away from here.
—
Are you talking about the particles...?
—
Indeed. I heard and saw the whole conversation you had with them.
—
No sh#t, I already know that. I'm not that ignorant. What's the matter regarding it?
—
"Not that ignorant", you say? Do you even remember when you told them that you wouldn't buff them, otherwise it wouldn't be "as satisfactory" for them to defeat me?
—
Yea, and? What's wrong with tha-
—
You already buffed them. They aren't even particles anymore, but some gross blob things instead.
—
I... I mean, yea, but... otherwise they would be so small they wouldn't be able of even collecting the artifacts to summon you...
—
It's still artificial help, no excuses. If you wanted them to do it all for themselves, which I know that it WAS the supposed idea you had in mind to "aVeNgE yOuR sAbOtAgEd dReAm" and humilliate me or whatever, you already failed at that.
—
HOW WOULD THEY BE CAPABLE OF DOING THE JOB THEN?! HUH?! IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM OTHERWISE!
—
Simple... just like you implied with those lame words of yours, they don't. The idea was doomed, arguably since the very beggining. The only one humilliated out of this ends up being yourself, because of not paying attention to your own words and actions when making up the first parts of your plan, just a few minutes ago. Ironic, isn't it?
—
I-I COULD GO BACK IN TIME AND SOLVE IT THEN! THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, RIGHT?!
—
That would prove to us that you indeed failed with your plan, and thus want to hide that embarrasing fact, so it would only end up making ME be the one with the rights of mocking you instead of the opposite, unlike what you anticipated at first.
—
THEN WHAT DO I DO?!
—
Easy, just accept your loss. Though, I wouldn't mind fighting those things nonetheless... just don't expect yourself to have reasons to laugh at me, in case they do end up beating me thanks to your artificial aid.
—
WHAT IF I PERMANENTLY DELETE YOU INSTEAD? WHAT ABOUT THA
<ERROR>
...
—
Lets just say the consequences won't be good for you... I'd also get revived later, anyways.
A
lso, just think about it... what is a writter to
DESTINY ITSELF?
—
...what?
—
I
will let you figure out the rest by yourself, it WILL happen eventually anyways. Don't even bother trying to foresee it, though. It won't work, even with your narration force
.
So, that's all I had to say to you. Have fun with those particles, I guess. Noob.
|Block of pork then finally, FINALLY leaves Idontknow350 alone.
—
I heard that, lol. Still trying to do third person? That's lame.
|WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO LEAVE?! AND YES, I'M TRYING TO NARRATE, THERE'S TOO MUCH DIALOGUE ALREADY.
Still funny for me. Also, I'm not sorry for coming back. And, by the way, those who pork.
|NOO NOT THE CRAMP AGAIN, NO NO NO, AAAAAĄ̶̶̨́́͡͡A̴̛͟͟͜͟͡͡Á̷̧̡́̕͟͞À̵̛̀͢͞͝͏À̢̧̀̀͡͡͞-
...
It kicked me out of my own dream. AGAIN. At least its finally gone now, so I guess I can finally speak in third person again normally. As for the reader, uh... sorry about what just happened, I guess...? I'm as confused as you...
...
So, Idontknow350 obviously was now awake once more because of this incident. Even though he got cramped out of his sleep again by Blork, this time he wasn't as angry about it, just because of how odd its message was, along with how it was able to both overhear the narrative and ignore the latter's attempts to get rid of it. Also, what did it mean by 'destiny itself'? Welp, only one way to find out...
Due to his powers, Idontknow350 was able of seeing the future, easily noticing that what block of pork meant was that
<ERROR>
...
Welp... I guess it REALLY didn't lie to me when it mentioned I couldn't foresee those future events. F#ck. That's fine though, not like I actually wanted to know it all yet, that makes things more... interesting. I WILL eventually get my revenge on it, anyways, and it won't be able to do ANYTHING about it, since at the end of the day it's just another entity locked within this Wikiverse, just like all others.
Also, I JUST realized I almost forgot about the particles because of this situation that thing got me into, dang it. At least it seems like they're doing well in the Fleshverse. Though, even with what I said before, I'm still a bit worried about what could Blork do to them, as in permanently corrupting them...
—
M
any ways I have to destroy, corrupt or just straight up kill them in fact, just like you said. That would be no fun, though. YOU will be the only culprit for both their and your own demise
.
|...really? Now it can randomly get outside of my dreams too?
—
Bro, HOW did you even get summoned THIS TIME?! STOP ALREADY!
|And now it leaves right after... good. I didn't want to deal with it now.
But you know what? I had enough of this stupid chapter. The annoying meat piece is distracting me WAY too much from what you all may want to see (or read).
B
esides, it's most likely just another user from this Wiki messing with my narration, and using block of pork as the tool to bother me
.
Also, Im pretty sure at least one of you who reads this doesn't even care about me and my
super mega tragic
lore. So yea, episode's finally over. Bye.
