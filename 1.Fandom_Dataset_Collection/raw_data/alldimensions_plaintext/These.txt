These
is a strange verse that is just a clump of things. It orbits our local
Ball
. Nobody knows how it exists, but it does. There are lots of theories.

Theories
[
]
Theory #1
[
]
This is the most likely and widely excepted theory. Basically, a smaller Ball collided with a larger Ball near our Ball, and These is the collision fragments. The angle was somehow just perfect that it went towards our The Ball and started orbiting.
Theory #2
[
]
This is the 2nd most likely and widely excepted theory. This theory is that These is actually part of our The Ball, but for some reason orbits it.
Theory #3
[
]
This is the least likely and widely excepted theory. This theory thinks that
Alphasm
created These but won't tell anybody. This isn't very likely because nobody has a reason for why Alphasm would do this.
So, what is These?

These is a clump of random objects.
Objects

The Boox
[
]
The Boox is like
The Box
, but it contains miniature duplicates of every single
Entity
that ever existed. Each entity has enough power to warp spacetime, destroy a
Cetaverse
, and disappear. The Boox also contains another
Omniverse
.
Those
[

Those is like These, but

the size. It also doesn't have a Boox in it, The Boox escaped and got bigger, and is now the Boox that is part of These.

This isn't an object. It doesn't have any properties. All Dimensions Wiki.
Qêmnår
[

Qêmnår is like an inanimate form of
Me
, but the size of
·
. It's completely hollow on the inside, and surprisingly, no entities live there.
