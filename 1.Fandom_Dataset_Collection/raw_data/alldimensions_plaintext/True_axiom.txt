The
true axiom
is the strongest and most fundamental
axiom
. It describes everything that is in the imagination of a
Betasm
.
When an attempt is made to break or destroy a true axiom, the reality itself will do everything possible in order to prevent this from happening.  Since these axioms are used in everything with
conceptual rank
1, they're used in objects higher than
Finality Index
3. In other words, they can't be described, and they're the most fundamental and small things with a conceptual rank of 1.
If they're destroyed by some Post-Betasm creature, then their imagination will collapse in that point.
As is the nature of these axioms, there is no denial in its existence; Whatever the axiom causes is what reality causes; This is a fundamental part of the axiom's causation of all and causation of nothing.
(I've added on a bit more, if anyone wants to get to further tackling this article, go ahead; I am not very creatively inclined :) )

True axiom is one of the most powerful voids, because it is only 0.00001% matter, and the 'matter' is just letters. Fill in the void by
