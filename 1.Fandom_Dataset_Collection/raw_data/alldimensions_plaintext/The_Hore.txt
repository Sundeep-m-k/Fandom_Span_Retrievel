The
Hore
is a place and center (not really a center) located in the right part of an
Omniverse
and is a huge ball made up of 60%
imaginary energy
, 39% unmeasurable matter, and 1% other matter... the Hore does not have layers like
the Core of Everything
, but rather consists of two layers as follows: The first layer is a white ball made of the above. The second layer is a thin shell that protects the inside from the danger of harmful particles from entering it. The Hore was discovered in the
Local Xeno Group
, which is approximately about â„µ
10
^100
light years.
Difference
[
]
The Hore is not The Core of Everything because it is not located at the center of everything rather it is in the East of the Omniverse.

Trivia

If Dark Energy does not interact with Imaginary Energy, this means that The Hore does not accept this substance or anything similar to it.
No expedition has been made to it yet.
The Hore is younger than the TCoE because it originated approximately sextillion billion years after the TCoE
