Kalaverses
are
class 23
verses
which are full of Kalaplanets. Unlike an
Universe
, Kalaverses are way more dense, with the average distance between planets being 50,000
knm
.
There are no
star
-like objects or higher-level
galaxy
-like objects in a Kalaverse.
Structure
[
]
The Kalaverses are spherical, with a bubble-like barrier which is actually relatively easy to escape. Inside, they have Kalaplanets, which have
Kalagrids
. They are very close to each other and arranged randomly, always in motion. However, they have a force that repels them and doesn't let them collide.
History
[
]
Kalaverses start as small cores of transfinite ultraenergetic pseudo-particles that are expelled by the core of a
Kalabox
. The pseudo-particles are in a superposition of sorts, and collapse when they leave the Kalabox's core into one of two states.
Depending on the state, the pseudo-particles use their high energy to expand into a
Kalacasing
or
K-Invar
. The Kalacasings use their remaining energy to become a fullfleged
Kalagrid
while the K-Invar
verses
quickly clump toghether and start attracting the newly-formed Kalagrids too. This inuniformity causes the Kalaverse to unstabilise, so it rapidly expands because that is the easiest way to remove the energy aquired from the instability.
This expansion makes the Kalaplanets move away from eachother and start having empty space between eachother, which lets them dissipate their heat and cool down.
