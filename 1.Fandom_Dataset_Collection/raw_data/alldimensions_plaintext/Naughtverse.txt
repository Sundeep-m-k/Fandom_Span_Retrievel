The
Naughtverse
is a verse that leads to
empty space once entered
.
It is currently unknown how this is possible, as the empty space appears to be infinite in size, yet
Naughtverses
can
never reach infinite size
.
It is thought to be an
interdimensional portal, although this phenomenon can't occur naturally
, according to our observations and knowledge.
Naughtverses
are used as hidding spots for oncoming attacks by beings from the
Ketabsoverse
. The dimensions the
Naughtverses
lead into have
no discernable pattern and are thought to be empty white-noise-dimensions
.
