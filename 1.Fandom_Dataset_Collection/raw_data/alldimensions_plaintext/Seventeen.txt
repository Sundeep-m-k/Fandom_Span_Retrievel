Seventeen
("
Grob'baw"
in
The Pencil Language
or
Zedak
in Future English) is the 7th verse in the Eleven Chain.
Appearance
[
]
Seventeen appears to just be a giant, white void. So far, no image of Seventeen has been taken from the outside due to it seemingly not existing if looked at from outside.
Structure
[
]
Seventeen has 17
Sixteens
in it, each with their 16
Fifteens
rotating around them. These Sixteens are very close together, and travel a fixed path around each other. This path also ensures that no Sixteens collide with each other.
