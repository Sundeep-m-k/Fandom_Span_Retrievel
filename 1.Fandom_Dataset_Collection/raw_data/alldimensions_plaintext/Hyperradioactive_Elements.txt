Hyperradioactivite Elements
are higher forms of radioactivity, found outside of
Universes
. They start at Element 171, which is unheptunium, and have a different forms than usual atoms.

Hyperatoms
[
]
Substances with at least hyperradioactivity of 2 are denoted as hyper-atoms. They are too unstable to sustain a element in an universe. Thus, all hyper-atoms are structureless matter made of
Uqraek Fibers
, due to lack of normal physics.
However, they produce hyperradiant waves or
chaos particles
with tremendous heat energy. Electrons, in the other hand, are still a energy source. This allows hyper-atoms to be ionized, but it has to be Imaginary Transfused by a hypernuclear reactor in
Imaginary Cube
. Doing so allows you to gather
Imaginary Energy
, and electric charge plus dark energy in universes.
99% of hyper-atoms are generated naturally from different various positions, but with various rarities. Most commonly, hyper-atoms are found in
Hyperradioverses
plus its higher forms, and so
Le Jorino Areas
in
Cetaverses
. Hyperatomic modules can only be formed by a more powerful
Imaginary Sphere
.
Changes from Atoms
[
]
Hyperatoms don't start at the end of period 8, which is element 168 (Unhexoctium / Radianesson, Rsn
168
), which is a radioactive noble gas that is close to hyperradioactivity. Around element 171 (Unheptunium, Uhu
171
), you will start to see drastic changes after this point.
Hyperatoms are always plasma, but will become unstable in universes. Groups for a period on the periodic table are also replaced at this point.

Bi-radioactivity (171 - 560, periods 9 - 14)
[
]
These elements are found outside of
Universes
, and have a shape as
Cosmic Clouds
. At first, they can be nonexistent and be stable in
Multiverses
,
Metaverses
,
Megaverses
, and
Gigaverses
. At upper scale, it is found in
Teraverses
due to how it starts to be unstable. Some glitchy elements, like Glitchionicite, have particles too dense in a region and requires Logicium to synthesize.
Elements of this level can be easily decomposed by a hypernuclear reactor, and used for hyperthermal energy as a fuel to multiversal weapons and
vehicles
.

Tri-radioactivity+ (561 - 1,340, periods 14 - 19)
[
]
At this point, hyper-atoms start to become unstable. They now emit greater chaos particles composed of exotic
Primordium
substances. Elements of this level also consists of exotic substances uncommonly, including a batch of
Primordium Alphas
. Most notably, electronic clouds sometime shake out.
They can be found anywhere in an
Omniverse
, and uniquely found at the edge of an
Outside
. As hyper-atoms get exotic and defy the laws, they are found in
Hyperradioverses
.

Tetra-radioactivity+ (1,341+, periods 19+)
[
]
Tetraradioactive+ elements could destroy Omniverses and can constantly change
existence ranks
like
glitchy
and
fused
. They have a unique property defied by Logicium to allow multiple isotope forms to all elements. This makes stretching disorderly and nonexistent portal rings to other
Barrels
possible, as an advancement. Decomposing from now on needs
Primordium Omega
for power.
To sustain this, it should only be found in meta-disordered Hyperradioverses, at the border before a
Barrel
. Sometimes, they are found in a
Cetaverse
anywhere, even in a rare Megaradioverse there. Levels are now found throughout
Radioactive Chain
.

Notes:
Elements after 18,278 (26
3
+ 26
2
+ 26) have a 4 letter symbol because every combination of 1, 2 and 3 letters has already been used.
Elements after 475,254 (26

+ 26
3
+ 26
2
+ 26) have a 5 letter symbol because every combination of 1, 2, 3 and 4 letters has already been used.
Elements after 999,999 use a special system of combining a latin letter with a unicode character. Elements up to 50,000,000 may still use the 5 letter system. The only outlier is Swagggium.
