In a
Universe

Metaverse
, following fairly similar laws of physics to what we are familiar with, but not completely so, on a planet called
Bodhea
as well, life was beginning to form. The newly created planet had hot exotic metals and minerals just formed in its core following a collision.
Built up gasses from chemical reactions make their way up to the surface of the planet, making way for other elements to follow and react with the liquid that currently totally encompasses the planet. Single cellular strand-bacteria called
Oclis
begin to form in the year of approximately -1,250,000 OYC. After a long run of evolution, the entire planet is inhabited with bacteria, and around 300,000 OYC after the first lifeforms, a species of creature known as the
Vixitia Oclis
, a jellyfish looking creature, began to exist.

Vixitia Oclis and Novixitia Oclis - Water
[
]
The Vixitia Oclis was around 1 cm in size, with a cone-shaped shell for a head, containing its nervous system, organs and tentacles. The problem was, that once other creatures got around to eating them, they could simply swim behind the Vixitia Oclis and eat it by the tentacles. Thus, ~200,000 OYC later they had to evolve to a new species called the
Novixitia Oclis.
The Novixitia Oclis was larger, naturally, had wider tentacles, a more defined and smoother shelled head, with had a long triangular plate of shield on its back side, which acted as protect and camouflage, in its blue background. They also had better eyes and could evade predators much more effectively.
After a long time, land began to protrude from the water and tectonics began to shift it around. Meanwhile, many of the creatures began to make their way to the outside. Creatures that were already living on these mounds, like the Dormiens Vespertilio, or the Aqua Tumulus, which were simply lying on top of the hills, staying dormant until they needed to feed, simply started to poke out of water more and more, and thus had to adapt to these changes. Other creatures had it tougher.
As the Novixitia Oclis began to make its way up land more and more, to scavenge for food and else, they began to evolve again. They grew longer, stronger and wider tentacles, with a more spherical skull and a torso more exposed to make way for its organs, but heavily protected under a thick sheath of living tissue. At this point, at specific cases, the tentacles could even act as legs and support the full weight of the creature, when it needed to reach for food or observe its surroundings. 400,000 OYC later, it evolved to become
Sipriencis Oclis
.

Sipriencis Oclis - Land
[
]
At first, Sipriencis Oclis fed on things of most similar composition as to what it ate in water, but the further the Sipriencis Oclis ventured outside of their territory, the more variable foods they began to feed on. Smaller creatures, flying insects, nectar and accumulated glucose, they hadn't evolved anything that they could use to cut food with, and so they still had to rely on simply swallowing a food whole and decomposing it.
Throughout this time of around 50,000 OYC, the Sipriencis Oclis went through many changes, like acquiring the aforementioned teeth they needed, and their back plates curving inwards to avoid poking into the ground they walked on. They weren't yet walking upright, but there are many fossil examples of Sipriencis Oclis with their plates so long, that they would've had trouble angling themselves at all, and thus being incapable of looking upwards without using a slope surface.
For the next 120,000 OYC, the Sipriencis Oclis began to move across land, occupying as much of it as they could bare to live in. Whenever tectonics would drift apart large chunks of land and form either islands or continents, the Sipriencis Oclis would always be there. By now, the Sipriencis Oclis lived comfortably on the ground, but in the next 60,000 OYC, major changes would happen. With the population explosion of ~ -180,000 OYC, the Sipriencis Oclis would have to quickly adapt to new strategies, food supplies and tactics, and evolve into the
Arecta Oclis
.
Arecta Oclis - Hunter Gatherer
[
]
By now, their tentacles are bridging the gape between "tentacles" and "legs", they are always standing on their legs, they have no problem supporting their full weight and can transport much faster.
At this point in time, creatures like the Cleamitrix, Paleada, Ba Inda and more, are posing a real threat to the former Sipriencis Oclis, forcing them to make many changed to their habitats and lifestyles, thus becoming the Arecta Oclis. Hiding in caves in groups, eating the nutritious viscous liquids of the lot cones, cooking their game, using tree bark for hunting and sharp shale to tear apart ligaments, the most basic of civilizations was beginning to form, at around -100,000 OYC.
From this time, unsurprisingly, many relics have been found. Sticks with engraved lines and shapes, signs of counting and ever-growing intelligence, the first symbols to have been found, were engraved on the inside of a fossilized mushroom head. It is unknown what they signify, but are very likely to be symbols.
Huts, bridges, flimsy clothing and spears were first created from -90,000 OYC to -75,000 OYC, utilizing the skins of animals, barks, thick-grass, glue (dried nectar), plants and different kinds of rocks. Before long, the Cassiterite era came (-73,000 OYC to -65,000 OYC), where tin ore veins from surface rocks and cave walls were extracted and placed into fires to be melted and molded into knives, arrows, picks and more.
The Arecta Oclis became more and more intelligent, crafty and grouped together more and more, which at around the year of -61,000 OYC, with the creation of the first ever known village called Jinmelea, culminated into the formation of a proper, agreed upon, society.
Agricultural period (-61,000 OYC to -49,000 OYC)
[
]
Acrexisia Oclis - Farmer and Harvester
[
]
The Acrexisia Oclis came right after the Arecta Oclis. As the Cleamitrix were growing much stronger, the Arecta Oclis had to develop a more sustainable economy, and switched from a hunter-gatherer society to an pseudo-agricultural one. This advancement allowed the new Acrexisia Oclis to have a consistent food supply. The Acrexisia Oclis soon took over and assimilated the Paleada, started to develop a military, and created the nation of Zifvrexa.
Even though the Acrexisia Oclis had already moved on from a hunter-gatherer society, they still practiced it from time to time. In about 550 OYC, they had fully switched to agriculture. The Acrexisia were the first to on Bodhea to develop a complex language. With the development of language, communication/coordination was much easier. Jinmelea was made the capital of Zifvrexa, and was heavily developed and urbanized.
During this period, the first laws of Zifvrexa were created, although many were very unfair and were quickly gotten rid of. In the end, 5 laws were approved and passed by the first ruler of Zifvrexa, Vixita. Vixita would soon have many myths surrounding them and quickly became revered as a hero after the Acrexisia Oclis were replaced by the next group of Bodheans.
Xefitis Oclis - Domestication and more advanced tools

After around 5,000 OYC, The Acrexisia Oclis were replaced by the Xefitis Oclis. They figured out how to domesticate other creatures/lifeforms on Planet Bodhea, and also developed the first archaic machinery on Bodhea. Jinmelea was once again added to, and became even bigger, growing over the OYC. In about -54,000 OYC, Jinmelea was a very large city complex home to over 50,000 Xefitis Oclis, along with a handful of other species.
The discovery of domestication by the Xefitis Oclis also proved to be extremely useful at expanding the Xefitis' territory. The Xefitis Oclis managed to conquer part of Cleamitrix, although they were soon chased out. However, further attempts on claiming the Cleamitrix's land proved to be successful, and the Cleamitrix nation was conquered and became a vassal state of the Xefitis Oclis in -49,130 OYC.
As agriculture was now practically everywhere, most conquered parts of the Xefitis' territory were converted into farmland and were not defended. This led to a excess of weak and undefended spots in the Xefitis Oclis' already vast expanses of territory, mainly in the outer regions. The Bodheans' old enemies, the Ba Inda and Paleada were also growing along with the Zifvrexa/Xefitis nation. The Ba Inda and Paleada formed an alliance and they took advantage of the large amounts of undefended areas, with them beginning to attack and invade them. The Xefitis were alarmed, but they eventually had to give up much of their outer territory and move the capital elsewhere, as it was starting to be under threat due to the large Paleadan and Ba Inda forces. The city of Jinmelea was abandoned in -49,020 OYC, and the capital was moved about 176 miles away.
The Paleada and Ba Inda alliance soon captured Jinmelea in -49,000 OYC and established it as their capital, naming it Dijeda. The Xefitis Oclis would still try to claim their old capital, although they all failed miserably.

Having failed to conquer their own home place directly after being booted off, the Xefitis Oclis would settle in the Thepeya forests, for around 120 OYC, despite legends and myths of its dangerousness and others talking about how it was the residence of hell itself. It wasn't, but the Xeftlis Oclis had no other place to go. After the 120 OYC passed, some natural disasters had happened in the nearby region, causing the Ba Inda and Paleada to scapegoat the Xefitis Oclis, and resulting in a large scale pillage, in which hundreds of Xefitis Oclis died, and a minor percentage successfully fled, after being chased a good bit deeper into the Thepeya forests. In less than an OYC, all Xefitis Oclis had escaped the Thepeya forests. Fearing for their lives after the raids, especially due to the Ba Inda and their brutal tactics, all Xefitis Oclis felt they had no other option but to explore any land which was available to them.
After moving south-east, their populations grew large enough to branch off into multiple groups, two of which were the largest, one exploring the south, and another which went north-east.

From the forests of Thepeya, the south explorers, called the Onochien tribes, went through Taotad, Gar Éngar, Tododab and Nadagág (-48,870 OYC), where they eventually set base and started villages with farming and everything necessary for them to thrive. Many went further down to Echedab and Cegínphe, fearing that the others before them were too close to the Ba Inda. Some went even as far down as the Katalmak region, which is what they're named after, called the Katalmak tribes; constructing housing in Pirkilísin, Adad, Nehepha and even Swamal (-48,800 OYC). Fragments left behind during their journey from Thepeya to Nadagág show many similarities, suggesting hastefulness, whilst the ones tracing from Echedab to Swamal and western Anaternis show much more flavour and variance, meaning that the Xefitis weren't as eager to head south.
Meanwhile, the north-east tribes, called the Soyon-Ifyes and Dadanhryz tribes, travelled in very straight lines, which took them from Thepeya to Nmatagle, northern Atigobáy, the vast region of Dadanhryz, where many eventually settled (-48,870 OYC), then southern Srydanka and eventually, some even reached as far as the Gar Adse (-48,865 OYC). The north-eastern travelling tribes were willing to come much further distances.

Over the course of the next couple thousand OYCs, after all tribes originally on the move had settled and began to move independently on their own more naturally, settlements, bases, villages and temples began to appear all across Bodhea. By -41,000 OYC, every place from Sinish to Huchen had been traversed through. By -34,000, the vast region spanning from Ukueke through Dadanhryz to Úbor had been colonized and 5,000 OYC later, the northern Úbeggadi started having permanent populations too. These populations soon moved west, through the Iknek islands to Uhldimakuyucén, eventually ending up at east Sudayia by the year -31,000.
In approximately the year -32,500 OYC, an ice age hit Bodhea and caused wast chunks of the liquid covering the Bodhean surface to freeze. This, combined with windier conditions, causes this ice to flow into a spot situated directly between the Ibinán region and north Skúnie. Many islands located within this region allowed for safer transport, until 500 OYC later, by the end of the ice age, Skúnie had also been colonized.
By the year -20,000 OYC, every 100 square kilometers was found to contain at least one relic, artifact, treasure or cultural indicator, signifying the end of the exploratory period, as every chunk of land of significant proportions had been traversed.
Shtuegga Period (-20,310 OYC to -16,720 OYC)
[
]
The Shtuegga period begins with the Andaddea civilization, sprouting from the region of east islands called Shtuegga. Specifically from the islands of Hinterita, civilization as Bodheans, and we, know it began.
In the year -20,310 (+/- 10), a city called Andaddea was official titled and "formed", with many houses, shops and a growing population. Sellers from the Shtuegga islands were sent outside of their islands to sell rare earth metals and materials found only locally within their own islands, with Andaddea being the center of the financial action. This move proved to be great for the Shtuegga civilians, as their trades proved successful anywhere they went. Growing proto-economy allowed for the king to continuously expand the Andaddea city, alongside with many other cities on the Shtuegga islands nearby.
Eventually, by the year -20,000 OYC, Andaddea became a giant city stretching out over all of the Shtuegga islands, with villages scattering across the coasts of Tontsán, Idis Idius, Sarcén, Unús, Akabake and north Sasdse, totalling a population of 14,581,000 Bodheans by that same year. The city was so large, that it functioned practically the same as a country, however, Bodheans never created countries, only large cities where ever they deemed fit, and nobody would stop them, unless they had some sort of quarrel before. This is because Bodheans are, and were, much smarter than humans and didn't lke bordering themselves from off from the rest of society.
10 OYC later, Andaddea spread further north, west and south, reaching into the Dadanhryz superregion, touching the tip of Gar Adse mountain peninsula and setting up camps by the Éádor sea. The Andaddea population was very diverse, with its overarching size bordering cultures and religions like partitions. However, as it turns out, unlike here on Earth, the mixing on traditions won't cause one race to attempt to conquer everything in its path for "glory" when your population cares about more important things than how other people live their lives. You see, by now, the vast amounts of time that had elapsed had caused the Bodhean's fear of the unknown to exclude rudimentary things which fell under the category of stuff with which they were already familiar with, like, for example, other Bodheans.
The proceeding OYCs later, Andaddeans somewhat settled and discontinued their expansions, as the costs for running the city became higher and higher, whilst the king could only accumulate so much wealth. Thus, the mega-city became stable for thousands of OYCs, living for longer than most colonies do and seeing many inventions. Thanks to its population and surface area, most inventions from this period of time are attributed to the Andaddeans, for example, to list a few:
using wheels for transport, like the Adshaburk, which is a simple carriage extended to be atleast a 100-wheeler, primitive forms of insulation from half-molten tree skins stuck together, scented oils, the compass, the Oggoi clock, which was a large clock powered by a flowing water stream, not only rotating clock hands, but also rotating small rocks acting as stars and planets to visualize the sky even during the day, bounded books, primitive and simpler versions of larger boats, etc... hundreds more.
However, in the year -16,740 OYC, an ice age hit, causing Bodheans located in the northern half of Andaddea to be forced out downwards into houses to live with other people, or to go into other cities. Bodheans living on the equator could sustain the temperatures, however, productivity declined rapidly, most crops died and harvesting became near impossible. Local animal populations died out, whilst northern unfamiliar species, both invasive and peaceful, had to settle into the regions of Andaddea to be used as livestock. However, as more of the population got sick and was unable to work, alongside with the extremely harsh conditions which disabled even normal workers, the financial resources of the king became smaller and smaller, and as such, in the approximate year of -16,720 OYC, Andaddea dissolved into 18 smaller cities, each having their ruler and acting as a sort of hive-mind, with the wealth of the original king being split in between the 18 new cities. The wealth was split in accordance to need, as splitting it equally would cause certain larger regions to be underfunded, whilst the smaller ones would have unfair privileges.
This caused some civil unrest within the populations of smaller regions, as they felt that the larger ones had their budgets inflated by nepotism. However, this was disproven fairly quickly, as the rulers of each city ware found to be unable to answer even basic questions about the kings personal life.
Civilizational Expansion Period (-16,720 OYC to -9,985 OYC)
[
]
As the ice age roared on, Bodheans took travel into warmer and resourceful regions available to them. Long travels weren't always possible to conserve energy, so bases were set up on every step of their ways. After 20 OYC, the Andaddeans managed to disperse themselves across the majority of the civilized world, carrying with them the legend of Andaddea, which hadn't been heard about on most of the planet, contrary to its sheer size and reach.
Civilians from Andaddea traveled around and spoke their story of Andaddea to people they visited, both as to answer questions about their whereabouts and travel purposes, but to also spread the legend of Andaddea and its prosperous stability, as well as inventions. These ideas spread from households to tribes to villages to the officials in charge, who now had an idea of what Andaddea was and how it functioned. The officials and elite saw this especially enticing, since the Bodhean religions were centered around the divine helping and kindness to other fellow Bodheans, and the prosperity of Andaddea was especially useful in this aspect.
As such, the region of Sinish bounded together to officially named Sinish, cities on the coast of the Tadaan sea groupped together, Skúnie and Obheta had their own supercity, the Ubeggadi region created a giant region of huts and tents, Uhldimakuyucén banded together, the Ennesyl region created Inassaana, Bausun created Sekadúr, getting their water from the Sekadúr lake in their city, and so on. Of course, not every region had its own large cities, but a good 10+ cataloged existed at their peak (this number ranged depending on one's definition of a large city inspired by Andaddea).
With their size came their own languages and a plethora of other things that can be viewed as progressing and benefiting society, however, this may not be linked with the unification of cities, but rather the general passage of time and how populations evolve culturally. These large cities would, by time, mold into the current areas that lightly dissect the Bodhean political geography nowadays.
During this period of time, societal and cultural change began to drift into uncharted territory. Architecture began the develop into genres very alien to generations of older days, as experimentation began to take over many aspects of life. No one genre held a monopoly over the specific thing in question. This includes art, societal norms, language reforms, structuring of society, hierarchies and many more. This may seem strange, since the very obviously primitive technology that the Bodheans were using, but the vast spaces of time allowed for this to happen naturally and artificially too.
Populations begun to grow slightly more, as simpler versions of medicine began to be used; science advanced further much more than it previously did, as mathematics evolved out of its infant stage with the discovery of the Pythagorean formula, Euclidean geometry, *plant formulas, the quadratic formula, exploration of algebra and more. Astronomy and star gazing was already developed enough, since even the Sipriencis Oclis were looking up at the sky and attempting predictions. The first public thoughts of Copernican-like solar system models were discovered to be from this period.
The end of this period is marked by the discovery and wide usage of iron, similarly to how us humans entered the iron age.
*Plant formulas were equations which were used on specific plants that behaved according to very predictable and mathematic laws, now known as Maticons
The Medieval Period (-9,985 OYC to -6,887 OYC)
[
]
The Medieval period of Bodhean history is called as such due to its shared common features with the medieval period of our history. It was also named this way, due to the way Bodheans call it also is similar to the concept of "medievalness". It is marked with many larger scaled, more influential and useful inventions and discoveries.
In the year -9,984 OYC, the "Ishilol" was invented. It was a large conical structure made from wood and rocks, with multiple curved blades joined together in the center of a circle parallel to the ground. This was the equivalent of a windmill and was used mostly to process plants, alongside other tasks, like mixing, mashing, grinding, hitting (for cutlery like silverware and armory) and more.
It allowed for much more automatic, quicker and efficient ways to do many monotonous and repetitive tasks, whilst maintaining the same, if not better, quality and the speed at which the tasks are done. From -9,984, -9,983 and -9,982 OYC, many were built across windier regions, like southern Unabarya, Fadaray, southern Úbeggadi, Katalmak, south Halosid and Skúnie, which saw significant increases in crop production and productivity. In less windy regions, similar devices to the Ishilol already existed, which were powered by free-falling streams of water, however, they weren't as big as the Ishilol, which quickly changed after Bodheans from said regions caught on to their popularity and effectiveness.
After receiving the kingship from the previous ruler Axannis - [of heavenly water] in the city of Uynem, in the year -9,540 OYC, Nonlimem - [bequeather of love], with the work of his associates, built the first ever university. Included within was high level schooling (trivial), housing of good quality both for students and teachers, a large library of 200,000+ Sunbirk (the Bodhean equivalent to books, however, not book-like), beautiful complex baroque-like architecture of caliber never seen before, a dining underground hall and more. The University was called "Totsem Archim", which is translated to "The vast vault of knowledge". The University was centered around 6 main fields: mathematics, medicine, theology, law, architecture and biology.
Inspired by the Totsem Archim university, other large cities began to create their own universities, usually either focused on other topics from the usual, or because another university was too far away for convenient travel. By -9,491 OYC, 138 universities had been built across Bodhea, which was deemed satisfactory and sufficient. The places which were able to afford universities also constructed more schooling buildings for Bodheans to partake in and eventually end up in said universities. This causes literacy rates to average from 48% to 76% across cities with universities.
In the year -9,102 OYC, a Bodhean by the name of Cheushi - [peacemaker of fire and life] publicized their invention of the Tutmekan, which acted in a very similar way to the Gutenberg printing press, however, adjusted to work on how Bodheans constructed their Sunbirks. From the popularity and usage of the printing press, it can be fairly easily deduced how the Tutmekan saw the light of publicity upon invention. The first Sunbirk printed from the Tutmekan was the famed religious story ascribed on the walls of a cave nearby Jinmelea dated to -53,500 OYC, called "Er Unsut arkam Insimisius" (The true image of God, of splendid glory).
Around 100 OYC later, by the year -9,003 OYC, the cleric Mansu - [harvester of faultless grain] from Cegínphe wrote the 7 Sunbirks titled "Skensu Ab'phansu-miel" (The collective wisdom on medicine and healing), which detailed, across the equivalent of ~10,000 pages, the collective knowledge of medicine and healing from across all of Bodhea. Upon publication, medicinal science vastly improved from this bank of never-before seen intelligence.
And just like this, from -9,000 OYC and further, inventions upon inventions, discoveries and ideas began to flood various fields and communities. Like the invention of the first proto-telescope in -8,953 OYC, or the Uktaku, a much smaller and transportable version of the Oggoi clock, the first ever vaccine, modern cloth-making techniques, and so on. The mere mention of these could fill an entire article of large size, so it is important to move on to the next batch of periods.
The Scientific Rebirth (-6,887 OYC to -3,526 OYC)
[
]
Removal of religion from science (-6,887 OYC to ~ -5,000 OYC)
[
]
Ever since Bodheans were living on land, they evolved to be non-"stubborn". In a way, if evidence contradicted their ideas, they wouldn't cling on to them as much as we humans would. This was evolutionarily advantageous, because knowing what as actual correct in the face of science would allow one to know which foods are safe to eat, which liquids are not healthy for you and generally just how to survive.
This carried itself across to religion also. Because religion was used to explain divine acts unexplainable to being without advanced knowledge, it stuck as true science. Each time a natural phenomena X was was shown to be caused by just another natural occurrence Y, X wouldn't be considered divine anymore, but Y would retain its divinity. However, unlike how this process took only about 1 OYC to transpire here on Earth, in Bodhea, it took thousands. This gave culture and society was more time than necessary to adapt and ponder on whether the ideas of god were as true as they believed them to be.
This type of demythological science was often not pondered at, since theological answers were deemed more than satisfactory, but there were of course exceptions.
The first in this chain of science was in around -10,000 OYC with the first Copernican models, which removed god's full grasp upon the planets and the sun, and in -7,100 OYC with the Hittitian theory of suns, which explained that stars weren't laid upon the Bodhean planet's sky, but instead were distant cosmic objects themselves. However, in the year -6,887 OYC, physics and geology experienced rapid growth. The true and official reasoning for this explosion of growth isn't fully understood, as these events happened so long ago, but it is widely believed that they stemmed from the research of other Bodheans that allowed for much more work to be done with actual foreseeable goals.
With the advancements of physics, Bodheans such as Thonstin - [of high significance], Adlapoyz - [the one who surrenders to none] and Intisiyel - [greatest amongst all] were at the bleeding edge, discovering basic concepts of classical mechanics, such as proto-gravity, eventually leading up towards gravity, projectile motions, surface tension, momentum and much more. Meanwhile, geologists of importance Gangulaus - [embrace of soil], Suinicius - [adventurer of the beyond] and many more dug deep into the earth, revealing how their planet's composition worked, how layers of Bodhea's ground and mountains got to where they got, the compositions of each layer and tied this knowledge with the rest of geography from the older days.
With the discoveries on their way, many soon realized at even faster speeds than ever before, that god was on a trend of losing power. Eventually, many thought to themselves as to whether god was of any merit, but these philosophical questions weren't embraced yet, as more work and proof had to be done to establish science's dominance. But by this point, roughly around -5,000 OYC, experiments regardless of their ties with theology, were being done left and right and were perfectly socially acceptable, with their outcomes being taken more seriously, than when they were expected to match the jigsaw puzzle of divinity.
Further scientific advancements (-5,000 OYC to -3,526 OYC)

In the year -4,989 OYC, the city of Handur ratified it's laws of divinity (titled: Eresimur Er Sodanam) and replaced them with the laws of basic accepted behavior (Eresimurem Er Dusantris Halpur). Next up in this trend followed the cities of Sko, Kyegén, Uhor and Pokresi in -4,988 OYC and 52 others in -4,987 OYC. These laws shifted the point of attention from the lord and brought them down upon the Bodheans themselves. Society began to shift similarly to how humanity shifted during humanism and the renaissance.
No longer did Bodheans assign mystical elements of life to god/s, but instead attempted logical reasoning much more often. This shift, however, was slow, and many did not even notice it was happening. What remained of god in the Bodhean's bodies was getting slowly removed, as biology began to deem cadavers as socially and scientifically acceptable for research. However, this biological research was much more important than from the skeptical aspects of religion. It was very and fundamentally important for medicine and took place over hundreds of OYCs. Organs were described in detail, diets were understood properly, how blood and the heart works was written down and basic understandings of the brain was also understood. This knowledge was far from anything advanced, but when compared to what previously was, it was nothing alike.
In the year -4,672 OYC, the most of this research was published, revolutionizing medical research overnight. This science was used for modernizing pre-existing and new hospitals, which caused the growth of the Bodhean population to start growing rapidly, as many previously unavoidable and lethal diseases were eradicated.
Modern Era (-3,526 OYC - 1,374 OYC)
[

Early Modern Period (-3,526 OYC to -2,877 OYC)
[
]
The beginning of the modern period, and subsequently the early modern period, is marked by a societal / cultural change, rather than much of a scientific shift.
More decorative and elegant clothing began to take over popular fashion, thanks to the acceleration of science and inventions shortly before, less attention was brought upon tradition and newer trends began to be valued more, architecture took more expressive, symbolic and decorative turns, art was allowed to flourish more than it used to, society as a whole began to feel the effects of very subtle acceleration of norms.
Houses were built with sturdier materials and the ways in which, for example, walls were built were upgraded to fit the modern times and provide actually reliable safe structuring of said houses.
With the modernization of society came the trans-portability of then previous non-mobile tasks. For example, during the medieval period, the sewing and creating of fabrics for clothing had to be done on large and clunky machines that could take up a large portion of a room. In the early modern period, the same tasks were shrunken down to a box of instruments and tools with materials and were able to do just the same outputs as before.
This is just one example of many which became so much more efficient, easier and cheaper to work with.
The Electric Period (-2,877 OYC to -1,966 OYC)
[
]
As stated by the name, and one can easily deduce, the electric period was the first time electricity began to be used. This period of time is longer than the early modern period by more than 260 OYC, thanks to the vast amounts of experimentation and new ideas which sprang into existence with the presence of electricity.
In the year -2,877 OYC, a Bodhean by the name of Cicishi - [carrier of uncountable knowledge] first documented and attempted to describe what electricity was in his work titled "On the undeniable existence of the unknown substance which can be captured by all of our senses with the exception of our sight" (Ensumen si'Otrokus nu Tscheshi Amilinsitukurub'es anu Luskenum sue nu Tschashanan haskar su). Cicishi described in detail and connected the similarity of the effects of electricity, such as slightly and major static electricity, electricity from fish and land animals, lightning itself, the electric nature of the local Tibikí, Ćuanxi and Oxián plants and more.
Cicishi's work offered much more to be done, but wasn't very insightful. Indeed, it was one amateur Bodhean of below average education describing their very limited and failing experiments with an unknown force. However, it allowed other Bodheans who read it to understand, that this force was something that was a part of nature and something to be studied with much potential ahead, causing Sakkadi - [afloat on water] to make a work which separated the lodestone effect from static electricity and showed some surface level workings of galvanic cells, Banshedi - [kingdom of generosity] to write an entiry Sunbirk on static electricity and exactly where it occurred and how good certain materials were able to produce it, and the famed Nuskenshen - [bastion of curiosity] to expand upon Sakkadi's work to cover electroplating and even drawing connections from Cicishi's electric plant experiments to other living beings by showing that electricity can have a strong effect when applied to dead and living muscles, thus marking the beginnings of bio-electromagnets.
All of these works, mind you, written in the exact same OYC, increased some already existing enthusiasm in the science community with an entire alien and new field to study. The scientific Bodheans quick started work on this field, elaborating on pre-existing unanswered lemmas, generating question from said answers and passing them onward. Quickly enough, Bodheans started thinking of way in which this electricity could be integrated into pre-existing technology. This, however, would take some time, but it wouldn't take too long for the first ever light bulbs and electric motors to take shape.
The Technological Uprising (-1,966 OYC to -1,185 OYC)
[

Technological Age (-1,966 OYC to -1,374 OYC)
[
]
The technological uprising is a period of Bodhean history that sprung out from the electric period.
In the year -1,966 OYC, a Bodhean by the name of Rosan - [the spring of life] wrote across multiple essays detailing what they believed to be possible applications of electricity, how these applications could be constructed and what their futures could be. This piece included the first ever prototype for a lightbulb and electrically powered motor were drawn and blueprinted.
Electricity was already seen as very useful, but Rosan's essays proved to the scientific community that electricity almost had a mythical status with its immense capabilities. By now, the extent to which the metaphorical electricity cave was explored wasn't that far, but every nook and cranny was detailed. Electrical studies were already implemented into the school curriculum in universities. Rosan's essays gave Bodheans ideas on how to move forward in the metaphorical electrical cave of inventions.
Electrostatic machinery, electrical circuits emerged from their infantry into much more advanced structures and Bodheans found definitive links between magnetism, electricity and light. Bodheans had their "Georg Ohms" who found and suspected mathematical patterns in electrical circuits. The photoelectric effect was discovered and electricity became an essential part of life by around -1,500 OYC.
Of course, it wasn't just electricity which went so far, everything else did too. Physics began to open up its quantum doors with scientists like Yuctschin - [eternal ponderer], Kslaus - [bright star] and Rohringen - [from space far away] conducting experiments on exactly what the atom is and if it contains partitions, what those were. Optics, microbiology, engineering, houses were built with much more advanced methods, but still retained their general looks. Chemistry had existed for a long time but began to move much quicker after the identification of the atom and molecules. Mathematics, agriculture, literature, it simply wouldn't do justice to even try to write down all of the discoveries, inventions, experiments, advancements, improvements and the sheer amount of geniuses that came and went through this technological uprising.
By the end of the technological uprising, society was completely different than what it was before it. Electricity was practically everywhere, telecommunication started to become a thing, Bodheans died due to preventable diseases orders of magnitude less, many old jobs became archaic and Bodheans were about to enter into the digital age soon enough.
Early Computer Era (-1,374 OYC to -1,185 OYC)
[

During this age, many pieces of technology used circuits. Be it somewhat complex or incredibly simple, they proved to be immensely useful. Bodheans though, just like any other creature fueled upon wonder, wanted to push the circuits to their limits and fully use their potential.
A large portion of this circuit-utopianism was fueled by the calculators which were created using them. They were large, used binary thanks to its efficiency and the only reason why they didn't have more functions or were so limited, was because their creators set out for a specific goal. Circuits weren't taken full advantage of yet, but this would change soon.
A team of scientists in a research center set in Anapan constructed a machine capable of decrypting and encrypting using over 70 different methods. The machine proved to be very useful, but took up space equivalent to 1940's computers that us humans constructed. Building this machine anywhere else would be cost inefficient, so scientists worked on making the components themselves as small as possible, whilst working correctly and faster too. With these advancements, in the year -1,363 OYC, a computer called TIB-B was constructed capable doing 200 computations per second. This was pushed further with the TIB-AB which was able to double its speed to 400 computations per second.
And so began a sort of competition to make circuits as small as possible, whilst jam packing as many in the smallest region of space. The TIB-O reached a maximum of 16,000 computations per second, in -1,360 OYC, the Sokul 4-Al broke that record with 41,000 computations each second, in -1,346, the ZasLaN broke 210,000 computations per second, in -1,296 OYC, and so on. Since this article is about the general history of the Bodhean civilization, and the reader is likely human, it is fair to assume that they are also familiar with basic technology here on planet Earth, and should find it satisfactory enough to simply say that the Bodheans made their way through the primitive computer age to the slightly-more-modern computer age in many clear ways.
Much importance and focus was placed upon these machines. Studies of computers, Boolean algebra and logic sprawled up as a necessity, and with it, integration of the inner components of computer machinery into other tools and devices. Now this trend made Bodhean history accelerate at unprecedented rates, as not only could practically any piece of machinery be controlled electronically, but also done at inbodheanly fast speeds. Mathematical proofs and astrophysical research started including programing and machines on a total regular, as did vehicles, watercraft and aeroplanes. This type of technology was a perfect fit for what was about to come, that being space travel and exploration (of course, in a very limited form, alas, if pushed enough, the Bodheans were perfectly capable of such a feat). With the body parts of the following detail, thus, it gives the movement around to where the species had recovered from, and before through.
