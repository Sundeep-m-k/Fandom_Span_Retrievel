Since new wallpapers keep appearing out of nowhere, it is constantly increasing.
The
Wallpaperverse
is a verse that contains every single digital and real wallpaper within the
Omniverse
. There is no known record of the Wallpaperverse being constructed, therefore it is thought to be a natural occurrence. This theory, however, does not explain how wallpapers appear inside the Wallpaperverse, nor why it holds wallpapers in the first place.
