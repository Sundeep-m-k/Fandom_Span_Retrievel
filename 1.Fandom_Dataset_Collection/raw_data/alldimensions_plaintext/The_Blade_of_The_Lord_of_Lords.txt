the test below this is the description
ᛒᒶ๏םԐ
The Blade of
The Lord of Lords
is the most strongest weapon in the
Godverse
ever, It Completely ANNIHILATES EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH!!!!!!!!! It's Made by The Lord of Lords to serve as his weapon and maybe a cooking knife, It's Also Very Sharp, can cut a
blueprint particle
Into ⅒ of it, It's size is also half the size of the Lord of Lords and it also transcends the ascendance of transcending a infobox and a class,
It's also surprisedly light like it's weightless or something and that means even
YOU
can carry this blade, however this blade is entirely made of everything and I mean it
That also means that your super cool god god god thingy is a part of it
