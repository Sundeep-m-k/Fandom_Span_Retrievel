About
[
]
The
Coins
are
complexes
full of nearly everything in this
wiki
. When
time
moves forward, the sides of the coins rotate to adjust the time that is within them. That is why nothing outside of the Coins have
conventionally
regulated time.
The Coins are made out of solid
TREEYUM
. Sometimes they can get broken, which affects the flow of their time a little bit, but it eventually adjusts again.
Time itself is contained by Coins, so that is why all Coins are important for things below ane above them. Some
creatures
have attempted theorizing how much would be the value of one of them too.
Types of coins
[
]
Linear Coin
[
]
This kind of Coin just simply always rotates either clockwise or counterclockwise, making a linear time. This kind of Coin will never rotate the other way and will always move at constant speed no matter what happens inside it.
Bilinear Coin
[
]
This kind of Coin has two time dimensions, and the wheel is split into two parts. One of the parts goes clockwise and the other goes counterclockwise. This causes time to go two different ways. One half of the inhabitants rotates with the clockwise direction; the other go counterclockwise.
n-Linear Coin
[
]
Depending on how many time dimensions a Coin has, it will be split into different parts to make up for the different time dimensions.
Nonlinear Coin
[
]
The last type of Coin is not linear and the wheel either doesn't move or moves randomly in either direction. This means time could go forward or backwards.
Other Info
[
]
You can control the flow of time within a Coin if you can rotate it in the direction you please. If you rotate it, it keeps the same speed as the other coins, so the speed of time is not changed when rotating, it is the same for every coin no matter which direction.
