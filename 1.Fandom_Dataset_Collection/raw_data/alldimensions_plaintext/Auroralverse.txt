“
When you entered this verse, you realized that the time had suddenly shifted to midnight. The night sky starts glowing above you. You look up and see a beautiful Aurora Borealis. Taking a look at the surrounding environment, you seen that you have now somehow arrived in the artic circle, seemingly like
Earth
. It's freezing cold, and you see that empty void that is also in front of you. The verse is beautiful, but at the same time, this is one of the largest verses you could have stumbled across.

The Auroralverse
[
]
Auroralverses
are
class 31
verses, as well as the starters of said class. On the surface, they seem simple but in reality, their properties are extremely complex and ineffable for most cosmic entities. Some properties of these verses is that they're completely "beyond existence", being far above the reality we are in. However, this is still in the constraints of a repeated layering of fictionalized mirrors of theoretically accurate false realities. Even though they're not the largest type of verse, they still transcend all dimensions and reaching sizes that spill into the territory of Fictional Googology.
Such scale of size and properties would be completely unreachable by humans and similar cosmic entities, taking a beyond infinite number of years and technology to reach, and even greater for it to be completely explored. This verse would also end all the chains of pre-existing verses and be nearly impossible to reach from the lower verses. Due to being the first class 31 verse, they have the reputation of "ending" the first three tens of classes of the hierarchies. This, and because they are so hard to access / escape to the point most species decide simply not to expand anymore past this point is the reason why the next verses of class 31 are known as
the revived ends
.
Auroralverses receive their name due to them being filled with certain patterns of colors that ressemble the ones of an Aurora Borealis, though this coincidence is only based on their visual aspect. Most of the time they have a cyan color scheme, though rarer Auroralverses have bluer or greener ones. Rarest ones even reach colors like yellow!
Timeline of our Auralverse
[

Approximately every (W.I.P) seconds, the verse completes a rotation. This time period will be referred to as a AvY, where AvY0 is the time where our Auralverse was first discovered.
AvY0 (Approx. 142.1(W.I.P)AD): The verse is discovered by scientists seeking to reach its core.
AvY2: The verse was estimated to be 10
-3042958
% explored.
AvY5: An incident happened where a fleet of exploring spacecraft, consisting of 374 ships, goes missing near the boundaries of the verse. It is unknown if they have reached the core or if it was destroyed by unknown reasons, though considering that the core was eventually found and they werent there, the latter seems to be the more probable outcome.
AvY19: The core of the verse was found, known as "the Auroral Core". It is only around 10
73
ly large, however new materials were found.
AvY21: Scientific analysis of the Auroral Core showed that the material that makes it is a new type of material not found in any previous verse. It is extremely strong, being around 185.3(W.I.P) times stronger than steel. This was named "Aurorium".
AvY39: Further analysis of Aurorium had shown that hitting it with a powerful particle beam of energy equal to 1852(W.I.P)~E watts would make it unstable. The unstable version is very unstable and in around 12.3 seconds it would decay and produce a large explosion.
AvY41: An unstable aurorium explosion has caused an estimated 0.118% of the verse to get damaged.
AvY241: The verse is now explored 10
-214
%.
AvY115815: The verse is now fully explored.
AvY4158124: Slight contact with its local revived end was made.
The Auroral Core
[
]
The Auroral Cores are the cores (duh) of the Auroralverses. They're only around 10
73
ly large. In them, you can find glowing crystals that have aurorium found in them. This material is very strong, being 185.3(W.I.P) times stronger than steel. After the discovery of this, this material started to replace pre-existing materials due to it's strength.

This verse was the first verse to be created by Akui No Chuushin
This verse reuses a lot of code from another project by Akui No Chuushin, called Aurora Borealis (including the <div> and background.
