Welcome to The
All-Dimensions Nexus
. The purpose of this page is not to create
yet another Hierarchy
, but rather to actually reveal the current state of the containment structure as actually represented by the pages of this wiki and the userblogs themselves. In other words, this ignores any and all "Hierarchy" pages and their claims as to the containment structure and takes only the pages themselves as "canon" (for better or worse!)

Please note that this is a WIP (Work-In-Progress) and is currently incomplete. More pages and information will be added over time. Organization may evolve as well. You can check back in to see how it's developing. The hope is to eventually include every page that falls under the definition of The Nexus (specified below), thus making this a complete "hierarchy" of sorts (no skipping anything!).
Definition
[
]
A Nexus, by definition, is a connected set of nodes, in other words, a
graph
(in the mathematical sense).
The All Dimensions Nexus, has a few additional properties of note. We note that in a graph pairs of nodes may or may not be connected by a single "edge". Here we consider two types of "edges". We have the relationship when one page says it's "Contained by" another page, and when one page says it "contains" another page. If B is "Contained by" C, we say C is a Container of B, and if B "contains" A, we say A is part of the "contents" of B. We can think of these as "directed edges", meaning for each edge there is two possible directions it can point, towards one or the other node. For conceptual purposes we can think of each edge pointing in the direction of the Container. This forms a Dominance Hierarchy for the nodes.
Please note that these relationships are not necessarily reciprocal in nature (according to the pages themselves). It is entirely possible for page B to have content A, but A not to list B as a Container, or for page B to have Container C, but C not to list B as content. It is also possible to have multiple containers and multiple types of content. In fact, we impose no preconceived properties on these relations. Why? Because we can not make any assumptions about the actual Nexus as represented by the pages on the wiki.
We will think of each page as a "node" or single point, with the name of the page written on it. If a page, C, is a Container of B, then we think of C has having a higher "Rank" than B. If B says it "Contains" another page, A, then we think of A has having a lower "Rank" than B. Again every page can have multiple Containers and more than one type of content, and it also can have no containers and no content.
If it has multiple Containers and Content we order them based on the order they are listed in the text. The "Prime Up" of a page is just the first thing listed in "Contained by" and the "prime down" is the first thing listed in "Contains". These may be followed by further options,
secondary up, tertiary up,
etc.
secondary down, tertiary down,
etc.
The "Universe" will be our initial node, it is part of The All Dimensions Nexus by definition.
We then have the following recursive definition:
If a page is already part of The All Dimensions Nexus, then any page it points to (either by being listed as "Contained by" or "Contains") is also part of The All Dimensions Nexus. It does not matter if the pages are official AD Wiki pages, or userblogs.
The Universe is by definition assigned a Rank of "0"
. The Primary Container of a page of Rank Z (with positive or 0 real part), by definition has a Rank of Z+1. The Secondary Container of a page of Rank Z (with positive or 0 real part), by definition has a Rank of Z+1+i. The Primary Content of a page of Rank Z (with negative or 0 real part), by definition has a rank of Z-1. The Secondary Content of a page of Rank Z (with negative or 0 real part), by definition has a Rank of Z-1-i.
Beginning with the Universe and going up this chain only clicking through the Primary Containers gives us what is called the "Primary
Versal Chain".
Each Verse along this chain gets a Rank, starting from the Universe, and going up as long as there is another Primary Container to click on.
Please note that
NOT
all pages in The All Dimensions Nexus are along the Primary Versal Chain. Sometimes secondary,tertiary, and so on, Containers and Content are available that are not part of this chain. These branch off the Primary Container Chain into more obscure pages.

[

A single page is listed on a single "line". First the pages Assigned Rank is given, then the pages name in quotation marks. If the page only contains a single item in "Contained By" that is the Successor Rank (one more), and contains a single item in "Contains" that is of the Predecessor Rank (one less), Then a vertical line is placed at the end with nothing else. If however these conditions are not met for any reason a [+] symbol is shown to the right of the vertical bar. This means either that one of these is missing, there is additional links beyond primary-up and primary-down, or both.

The Pre-Hierarchy covers all Pre-versal Objects that are below Class 1. The organization of these objects is not currently well understood so they aren't included here in the Main Sequence, however you can view what is known about them by clicking the link below:
