An entity or complex is classified as a Black Box when it meets the three following criteria:
-
Must be an extremely large idea complex capable of affecting physical space.
- Must be highly aggressive and extremely infohazardous. Specifically, these Black Box objects will attack any other nearby objects, and that they are capable of hiding information about themselves via a concealment mechanism.
- Must be significantly complex and organized. For example, their containing ideas must be extremely complex, and that the structure of these Black Boxes themselves is non-random, highly organized and robust to engineered adversaries.
The term Black Box was created due to the fact that they block out information about themselves. As a result, obtaining specific information and details about Black Boxes is extremely difficult. Due to the powerful concealment mechanisms of some objects, they cannot be classified as a Black Box. It is mainly due to the insufficient information to satisfy the third criteria. Technology is being rapidly developed so that our organization is capable of researching these objets

Formations

There are several different ways that a Black Box can form. For some, a Black Box can naturally form spontaneously in just the right configuration to consume it's surroundings and not be destroyed.
Black Boxes can also form via the extinction of an intelligent species or universe, resulting in it's remaining ideas being conglomerated into a single entity. If this conglomeration is "lucky", then it may survive and become a Black Box.
They can also form from other Black Boxes, ex. by detaching from an existing one and forming a new independent entity. This process can be done in both an
uncontrolled
and
controlled
manner
.
