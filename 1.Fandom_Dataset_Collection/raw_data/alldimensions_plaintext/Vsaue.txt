Vsaue
, written as
Λ
{\displaystyle \Lambda}
is a unit used to define the power of Vsauian entity, with one
Λ
{\displaystyle \Lambda}
being the minimum requirement for a Vsauian entity. A Vsauian entity usually rules over one or more infinite verses. Provided through its claim of what it sees on its basics, or from to where on End-All-Be-All.

When used to describe a Vsauian Space, the number of Vsaue is equal to the cardinality of the set of points contained by the space. Due to a Vsauian Space’s tendency to be as large as possible, this is all that is necessary to determine it’s size. To understand what a Vsaue is as a measurement of a CE: define a
Universe
as 1, and a “Universe of Universes”  (
Multiverse
) as 2, repeat these steps. An
Omniverse
would be
ω
{\displaystyle \omega}
, being the first transfinite verse. A verse larger than
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
would be
ε
{\displaystyle \varepsilon}
.
Gerald
would be
γ
↑
γ
γ
{\displaystyle \gamma\uparrow^{\gamma} \gamma}
and
Alphasm
would be
Ω
{\displaystyle \Omega}
, having complete and total dominance over everything in its mind. Repeat all the steps until you reach a being who has the same dominance over Alphasm that Alphasm has over its mind. That is
Λ
{\displaystyle \Lambda}
.. Then travel through Betasm, and that would be counting on the letter of Alphasm, which is ℬ...

D

is the Diskord: a unit fixed to the reciprocal of Vsaue as
1
Λ
{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\Lambda }}}
; Vsaue and Diskord collapse into nothing when multiplied.
