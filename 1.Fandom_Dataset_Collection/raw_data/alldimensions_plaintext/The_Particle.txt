The Particle
3D visualized picture of The Particle's shape (because its dimension is transinfinite, it will just look like a huge lump without 3D visualization).
Location

Elementary Hexahedron
Contains
The Inner Void
The Particle contains hypercluster, and is basic building block of the
Quantumverse
.
Probabilistical The Box Hyperclusters
contained in The Particle are a few times larger than the normal hyperclusters. The Particle is also (mostly) immune to destruction. The Particle acts like an extractor and a radiator for the hypercluster, precisely controlling the energy level of the hypercluster, stabilizing it.
⌬ The Particle's Temperature
[
]
The Particle has inner temperature that is bewilderingly cold. It is because The Particle controls energy flowing into the hypercluster, and any extra energy flowing into hypercluster may pop it. Inner space of The Particle is not always cold; when there is immense energy pulse outside The Particle, it briefly heats up insanely. That destroys both The Particle and the hypercluster.
⌬ Hypercluster's location inside The Particle
[
]
The hypercluster’s core is located EXACTLY at center of The Particle, meaning the hypercluster is contained at the center of The Particle. This seems to distribute energy around the hypercluster evenly, creating perfect equilibrium.
⌬ Composition of The Particle
[
]
The Particle is basically just a gigantic lump of energy and probability that is
sus
tained by balance between the hypercluster and the outside space's energy. It’s corners are all supergiant superclusters (about 1/100 of the hypercluster) with unusually active cores.
