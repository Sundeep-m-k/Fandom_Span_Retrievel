The Poly Cosmologies is a name describing how there are multiple differant cosmologies that eventualy merge together
as you go downwerds in the cosmology you split the cosmology into multiple piece.
this is how it works, an a-verse contains multiple b-verses, a b-verse contains multiple c-verses, a c-verse contains multiple d-verses
however eatch b-verse in an a-verse is lightly differant then the other one, and eatch c-verse in a differant b-verse in a differant a-verse is even more differant. This does not happen with every verse but it does with some.
the poly cosmologies can be described as a branching patterin with the lower verses branching off from higher verses.
the trunk of the tree and the highest level is The Box witch contains everything
a misconeption is that the poly cosmologies is more then one cosmology, this false. As stated above it is a single cosmology that is vary complicated, everything on this wiki is part of the same cosmology that eventualy leads up to The Box.
