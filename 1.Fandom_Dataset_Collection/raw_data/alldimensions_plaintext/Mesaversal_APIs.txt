The
Mesaversal APIs
are systems set in place by
the Illuminati
to allow for communication between different
mesaverses
within a
xeroverse
. Ordinarily, they are locked off to the civilisations within a mesaverse, but proper usage of mesaversal buffer overflows can allow information to be injected into the APIs.
Physically, a mesaversal APIs resembles a multiverse-scale structure, with various connections linking to neighboring mesaverses.
The types of channels present in a mesaversal API vary; some unlucky mesaverses have none, and some important mesaverses (known as
core mesaverses
) have almost every kind of known channel connecting with almost every other mesaverse in the xeroverse.
Typical types of channels that are widely found include:
Creation channels: Allows for the creation of new multiverses built to desired specifications in the targeted mesaverse.
Surveillance channels: Allows for remote viewing of events in any multiverse in the targeted mesaverse, presented as a high-dimensional holographic image in the mesaversal API.
Modification channels: Allow for the creation of matter in targeted multiverses. Often, the first thing a newly-xeroversal civilisation does is create a
mesaversal buffer overflow
engine in a neighboring mesaverse using a modification channel, and then uses that to access the mesaversal APIs in the other mesaverse.
Destruction channels: Allows for the destruction of multiverses in the targeted mesaverse.
Often, the use of these mesaversal APIs is inherently restricted - it is often a major undertaking to find a core mesaverse with an appropriate API for increasing the permissions of the APIs of the other mesaverses in the civilisation.
