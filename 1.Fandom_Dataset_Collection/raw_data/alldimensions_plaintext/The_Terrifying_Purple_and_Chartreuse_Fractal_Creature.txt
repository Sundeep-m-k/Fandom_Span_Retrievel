Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature
The Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature
is a very terrifying purple and chartreuse fractal creature who lives in a big infinitely large swimming pool filled with the blood of its enemies (this includes you). This swimming pool is known as the "Henryverse" but most people call it "horrifying" (in stark contrast to the Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature which is instead terrifying rather than horrifying).

The Legend
[
]
Once upon a time, a boy and a girl who loved to explore the
Omniverse
. Oh boy oh boy oh boy, what fun! Unfortunately after 17.53 femtoseconds, the Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature made them pay their unpaid taxes. After the boy and girl refused to pay their taxes, the Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature gobbled up their puppies and sealed their pre-pubescent bumholes shut. Oh no, this is horrible!
Then the boy and girl just fell over and died.
And the moral of the story is: Don't do drugs. And also watch out for Terrifying Fractal Creatures (especially ones that are purple and chartreuse).
The Second Legend
[
]
You'd think after getting its very own legend, it would be enough for the Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature but NOOOOO! Apparently it needed more!
So one day, the Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature was so angry, it decided to destroy the Omniverse. Joy! Unfortunately, it accidentally took a wrong turn when driving and accidentally drove up a long-ass chain of uninteresting verses with virtually identical descriptions. The Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature died of old age before it reached the end and was never seen again.
The Moral of the Story: Stay in school and do your math homework
The Fifty-seventh Legend
[
]
After dying of old age and being never seen again, you'd think that the story would be over but NOOOO! Why should the Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature get a break?
Also the Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature got very impatient when it came to getting all these legends so it skipped Legends 3-56 and went straight to 57. Wonderful. After coming back from non-existence, the Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature had a bowl of cereal and milk.
That's it. That's the legend. If you want a better story, too bad. Go bugger off to Wattpad and read a Thomas the Tank Engine x Diesel 10 smut fanfiction while licking the Cheetos dust off your boxers, would you?
No moral here because fuck you, you don't deserve to be a better person

After getting into a big debate about infinity with someone who knew nothing about ordinals and cardinals, the Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature decided that enough was enough. He's HAAAAAD it with these motherforking finitists yelling at him for being right. How dare they! After downing 2763 beers, the Terrifying Purple and Chartreuse Fractal Creature saw the ghosts of the boy and girl from the first legend! He screamed so loud that the eardrums of all dogs in the omniverses burst then he died.
The moral of the story: never kill people. killing people is bad
