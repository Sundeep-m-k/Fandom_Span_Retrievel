His appearance in the godzilla battle royale
Godzilla in Hell looks like the Godzilla from the Millennium series, to be precise, Kiryu Saga Godzilla, but sometimes GMK Godzilla, but mostly like the Kiryu Saga Godzilla which is a robust, muscular build and a deep, charcoal grey, almost black, covered in rugged scales that give him a rugged and battle-hardened look. The dorsal plates are also more sharper and whiter. When the hell bats devoured Godzilla and become one with Godzilla, it looks like Godzilla but flesh red.
His appearance in the Godzilla Battle Royale or WWG is slightly different since its Stick Nodes but it's even more cooler and Godzilla is skinnier.

[
]
Godzilla in Hell was first created in c. -Œ©œâ OYC by the THE TRUE CREATOR before
the Memer
or
üëÅ the slapper

During that he nearly died after an
Universe-sized Star
ultranova'd in front of him, after that the true creator made godzilla have the same exact powers as
The Hard to Destroy Reptile
SCP-682
, which is: fast evolution, immortality and supreme regeneration. but of course the true creator made sure that Godzilla won't go to far, but he also added huge plot armor to Godzilla.
However after knowing that he was a pet he escaped thus making him evolved even more further than he used to be.

realistic recreation of Godzilla causing the KT extinction event
Godzilla goes to an alternative universe where
the chicxulub asteroid
did not impact the planet, so godzilla destroyed the mesozoic by himself. after that he decides to live here.
(ok please don't remove the stuff again)
1954
[
]
after millions of years of dormancy, godzilla reawakens after
the united states
detonated the 15 megaton nuke,
Castle Bravo
at
Bikini Atoll
,
Marshall Islands
, as part of Operation Castle on March 1, 1954. Angered by the tests godzilla attacked tokyo at
November 3, 1954
.  later a scientist sacrificed himself to kill godzilla with the oxygen destroyer, it was successful since it disintegrated Godzilla's flesh only leaving the bones, but unlike the 54 film godzilla slowly regenerated for a half a century.
1954-2004
[
]
During Godzilla's absence, many Kaiju appeared to terrorize the planet. During the time he was sleeping he gained even more strength.
2004
[
]
Godzilla had fully regenerated from the Oxygen Destroyer, and attacked Tokyo again before an asteroid fell from the sky.
Godzilla then charged his atomic breath and shot at the asteroid with his atomic breath, causing it to explode as a huge mushroom cloud. The explosion destroyed much of Tokyo but Godzilla survived. However, for him, he had made a new enemy. A brilliant flash of light shone on him, causing him to quake. This was a beast that could wipe anything from the world without a care.
Ghidorah.
The Venus Hellfire proceeded to attack him, and they fought for almost a day. However, every time Ghidorah's light shone on the darkness of Godzilla's soul, it was evaporated; only the shadows of the light remained.
On the 11th hour, it was apparent to Godzilla that he simply could not win. His soul, the energy that made him what he was... Was unraveling. Fading. Every second that passed he was getting weaker, and in mere moments he was about to die.
At this moment, he realised he was desperate. Afraid. He realised just how much he valued his life, how much he wanted comfort and a life with no suffering.
His soul shone through.
He exploded, releasing a blast of blood-red nuclear energy. Ghidorah started to burn up, and he fled with only one head and a damaged leg. Some parts of Godzilla from the explosion went into space, forming SpaceGodzilla.
2014
[

after being absent for about 10 years Godzilla reappeared and attack the states of ohio, texas, NYC, and More
later the New Zealand government imprisoned godzilla into the ice using the mechanized kaiju, Mechagodzilla that was made in japan, the plan was successful as the mech froze the kaiju and the frozen body of the kaiju was put under the antarctic snow. after that the true creator tried to remove Godzilla's plot armor, but fails, he then asks
Gerald
to help, but they can only remove 10% of Godzilla's plot armor.

The Climax of the battle
After being frozen for a year, Godzilla reawakened. When he awakened he had inferior plot armor, but not the power to damage portions of
Heaven
and
Hell
.
Sensing the presence of a potential companion, he goes to
Rio de Janeiro
. The mechanized kaiju MOGUERA and Kiryu are activated to fight Godzilla, but then Ghidorah and SpaceGodzilla appear. Godzilla was forced to work alongside MOGUERA and Kiryu to fight these powers. With their combined efforts, Ghidorah was thrown into orbit. However, MOGUERA and Kiryu were severely damaged, and broke at the hands of SpaceGodzilla.
Godzilla and SpaceGodzilla then fought. Godzilla gets to knock SpaceGodzilla to the ground and fire his atomic breath. SpaceGodzilla fires his corona beam in return, with the beam clash destroying the entire planet in the process. SpaceGodzilla dies, but Godzilla lives, only with major injuries. Ghidorah then comes in and kills him, ending Godzilla's immortality.

Shortly after getting killed permanently for the first time, he falls into the vestibule of Hell. Looking around, he saw a rock tower with the words "ABANDON ALL HOPE YE WHO ENTER HERE" inscribed. He destroyed it with his atomic breath, revealing his the word "LUST" as his crime.
Once he is in the circle of Lust, he finds a power plant, which turns out to be a demon after he tries to feed on it.
Then, his punishment begins. The storm of all lustful souls consumes him, and he blows about helplessly. After untold ages of punishment, he enters the eye of the storm for a second, wherein he sees a female doppelg√§nger. Godzilla was stunned by the beauty of the beast. He managed to approach her and form a bond, at which point she showed it's true form as a demon. The two fought, and Godzilla managed to kill it with a red nuclear pulse. However, this made the floor of the Lust circle collapses, and Godzilla fell.
Godzilla awakened in the hellish city of Dis and would look around until a demonically possessed Rodan appeared to fight Godzilla, Godzilla won the skirmish but was chased down by Rodan, ultimately slamming him into the ground.
He went into a icy land where he would battle a demonic Anguirus, but unfortunately after the battle Godzilla broke the ice, falling into a deluge inhabited by the demonic Varan. When fighting, Varan fled; this was due to the appearance of a demonic Ghidorah. The demonic Ghidorah easily defeated Godzilla, with Godzilla having to run away through a whirlpool to stay in a different circle of Hell.
Having been rescued from the next layer, Godzilla woke up in Purgatory. Godzilla saw the mountain of Purgatory, as well as angels descending below and God at the top. Suddenly, the mountain awoke, commanding Godzilla to submit to peace and follow his creator's desires. However, Godzilla had gained free will. Thinking back to his life as a pet, he decided against it and crushed an angel who told him to submit to peace.
The forces of Purgatory became angry, and God cast Godzilla into Lake Cocytus, where he encounters satanically possessed SpaceGodzilla. Godzilla was easily defeated, with SpaceGodzilla bringing demons into his mouth and possess him, however, Purgatory sent a group of angels to possess him. The angels endowed Godzilla with God's strengthening him enough to vaporize SpaceGodzilla.
Then God tried to convince Godzilla to join them once again. Godzilla wasn't interested and used God's power to destroy purgatory, killing God. The angels and demons remaining in the Circle of Treachery began to worship Godzilla, however Godzilla instead ate some of them to shut them up and left, now with freedom.
Later, Godzilla entered a demolished city that was the Circle of Wrath. He fought Destoroyah and Ghidorah and beat them, however they regenerated and beat him up. The unceasing battle between the three monsters proceeded until Godzilla tricked Ghidorah and Destoroyah into firing into the wall. With the power of Ghidorah's gravity beams, Destoroyah's micro-oxygen beam and Godzilla's atomic breath, a hole would be made in the wall. However, all of Wrath was destroyed, shocking Godzilla and making him depressed.
Godzilla then walks across a harshly snowy blizzard, continuing walking on into harsher environments of hell. Later the
True Destroyer
decided to fight godzilla in hell, but he got lost in the huge place, godzilla instead gets into a portal into another universe, and ended up fighting 3 types of Destoroyahs, but ended up victorious, but as he was going to leave, he ended up in hell again.
Godzilla then finds a bridge to
BEYOND HELL
, then he walked on it, only for the bridge to collapse(possibly because
Vood'Em
doesn't want to be annoyed), he then falls into a pit of stalagmites, freeing several small bat like creatures known as
Hellbats
, godzilla then went into a different trail, he then gets attacked by The great devils and Magma mans, but godzilla defeated both of them after a long fight.
godzilla then gets frustrated and decided to destroy hell, heaven, and more stuff that connected to both realms, he did that, for an earth year, the result? heaven was 70% destroyed, but hell was more worst, at 89%, but fortunately before godzilla nearly got our local omni garden too, he got beaten by THE TRUE CREATOR, then after a long fight, both where weaken, but the true destroyer also helped, causing godzilla to lose and become weaker, both gods then sent godzilla deeper to hell.
after that the True Creator/Destroyer and
Transcendent Omni-Gods
freaked out at seeing the destroyed hell and heaven, and quickly went to fixing the places, as for godzilla, even though he was weaken, he was nearly going back to the living world, as the true creator accidentally sent godzilla to the mountain that has the gate to the living world.
for a earth week, godzilla went unconscious, then he woke up, losing an arm after a swarm of hell bats ate it, godzilla slowly regenerated as he climbed the mountain, but then a giant octopus like monstrosity with many eyes appear from the gate, it was the
Hell Gate Guardian
, it immediately pushed godzilla off the mountain, godzilla then gets angry and then shoots an atomic breath into it, but then
Jerald
decide to buff the Hell Gate Guardian a bit, and then as the atomic breath hits the Hell Gate Guardian, the creature repels the atomic breath, while also making it 1000 times hotter than hell, then Jerald removed the buffed abilities and the Hell Gate Guardian, become normal.
godzilla managed to dodge the beam, but the beam scorched his dorsal plates and thigh, and it hurted so much, godzilla then gave up for the first time, and let the hell bats consume him, the small creatures did so, but after they ate everything but his bones, they ended up being possessed by fragments of godzilla's soul, and he reforming Godzilla's body with themselves. he ended up being stronger, so he charged up a beam, so strong it could destroy 50% of hell and heaven at once, and he targeted the Hell Gate Guardian, then he shoots his atomic breath, completely destroying the demon. Godzilla would then climb the mountain and reach the gate(which survived) the demon was guarding, but before he leaves to the leaving world, he decide done thing...
This
place
and
the other one
are now
HIS.
to mark that hell and heaven is his, he decided to shoot his newly strong atomic breath, to heaven and hell, he did that, ruining True Creator/Destroyer and Transcendent Omni-Gods progress, after that he roared a bone chilling roar, signaling that hell and heaven is now his territory, he then went into the gate.

Trivia

This version of Godzilla in Hell is not the same exact version as the IDW version, this is a more fanmade version that is stronger and has more lore.
Originally, the page was spouse to cover the IDW version + the Godzilla Battle Royale version, but was later changed as the creator of this page(
Molang sus
) decided to add Godzilla to his 3rd part of his 3 part fanfiction (which is now cancelled due to the possibility of many stuff, the first part can still be accessed, and has the reason of why it was cancelled)
Godzilla is genderless, but he is pronounced He/him, because... well... he is the king of the monsters.
Godzilla is the secret villain of {
