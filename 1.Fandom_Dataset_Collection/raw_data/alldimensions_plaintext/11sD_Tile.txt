Tile
is a powerful
cosmic entity
who controls over his own
verse
, the
11sDverse
. He is a
2048 Tile
and he is the king of all of them on his realm. He is also made up of the
element
Tilium
that made him a Tile in the first place. 11sD Tile was the first 2048 Tile of his local
Endlessything
, meaning he formed and grew before everyone else. Thus, he's the
ruler
and king of all 2048 Tiles in there. 
11sD Tile is like any other 2048 Tiles except that he's the most extreme one, being the reason why he
became a verse
containing smaller objects. He is the creator of most 2048 Tiles and also all verses he had.
Forms
[
]
He has two forms: the one mentioned in the previous paragraphs which is just an avatar, and his form as a
TOG
. The latter has made over 600 edits and only on this
Wikiverse
.
11sD's pages
, some 2048 Tiles and verses in
class 28
and
29
are just some his creations and are made by him to work with. Btw he is banned globally because he is underage.
His avatar form is so strong that it can destroy
ERRORverses
too.
