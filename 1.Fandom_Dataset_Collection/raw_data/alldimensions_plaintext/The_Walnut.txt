About
[
]
The
Walnut
is a
verse
that is about the size of an
Other World
and, weirdly, contains
universes
and
&9ts
.
It also has a bunch of copies of
Earth
in it, except those Earths have only dogs on them.
Dungeon
[
]
There is also a special dungeon entirely made of walnuts located right outside of it. At the end of the dungeon, you will find a portal.
The portal goes to a nonexistent verse that somehow exists at the same time, and is made entirely of
Glitchonicite
and
Toxicium
, making it incredibly hard to get past. Yikes!
Special rod
[
]
At the end of that verse, there is a special item. The special item is a long rod made entirely out of
Primordium Delta
,
Alpha
, and
Phi
. There is an orb on the end of that rod which is instead made entirely of Primordium Delta,
Omega
,
Sigma
,
Epsilon
, and
Theta
.
The orb on the end of the rod has an unknown property that allows it to summon an infinite number of orbs made entirely of every type of primordium. Also every time the orb on the end of the rod summons one of those orbs, it also summons 25-400,000 random walnuts.
You can also use
Glitchonicite
to corrupt those walnuts and turn them into "glitch walnuts." When you eat those "glitch walnuts" you instantly have the power to glitch any
entity
out of reality.
