The
Other Boxes
are an extension of the
regular ones
.
Whereas, a Box contains everything of
existence rank
0 and 1 (
2-finality
), an
Other Box
contains everything of existence rank
0, 1 and -1 (symmetric 2-finality)
.
Other Boxes
thus are notably larger than a common Box, with the abundance of sub-nonexistent objects roaming the place.
Most of the existence-(-1) objects in them are normal and can co-exist with eachother in mass. But the larger naturaly made things are located distant from the closest of its neighbour. This is because, as an existence-(-1) is bigger and bigger,
an existence-(-2) icosahedron builds up around it and becomes exponentially larger as the object becomes larger.
These icosahedra can't collide with each other, as the closer they get to each other, the more repulsed they are,
like
electrons
.
These icosahedra pose no danger to existence-(-2) creatures travelling amongst them, and just act like barriers.
Existence-(-1) travellers can't interact with them and use them to their advantage for open space.
Because of the increasing distances between larger celestial objects,
the Other Boxes are much larger than they'd normally be, if these existence-(-2) icosahedra didn't exist.
