Lesser Üs
are verses filled with dangerous materials like
Toxicium
(no, it does not affect the
verses within them
), although some "uninfected" ones exist. These clean Lesser Üs commonly get infected later on, though.
History of our Lesser Ü
[
]
It's unknown exactly when it formed, but it was probably before
−
γ
{\displaystyle -\gamma}
OYC
. It used to be made out of DNA of darknesses (DNADs for short) and "empty" space, full of random particles floating around. Throughout most of its existence, there was not much more than void and DNA. The verse also used to show signs of life, often moving around in specific ways and intentionally destroying other smaller verses.
But around 2 million OYC ago, it started to fill with a lot of Toxicium like other infecteds of its kind. This rapid introduction of toxicium
killed
our Lesser Ü as well as over 99% of all life inside of it. The remaining life was set back.
Now it is mostly comprised of toxicium and fragmented DNADs.
Predictions estimate that around

{\displaystyle \theta}
OYC from now, the toxicium will be gone completely, but our Lesser Ü will not come back to life or anything, instead remaining some stupid ? dimensional "ball".
