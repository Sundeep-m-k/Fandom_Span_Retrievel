The
Blackverse
is a
verse
filled with hypothetical particles known as "
Ethons
".
These particles have no Schwarzchild radius, due to constant division when under pressure. They are also invisible, therefore, the universe is shrouded in
complete darkness
. The initial size of the verse was approximately 1 meter.
The universe's size gets divided by its age (in seconds), each second, and it is the same age as our universe.
