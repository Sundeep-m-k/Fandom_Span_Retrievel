About Auroverse
[
]
The "
Auroverse
" is a
Universe
-like verse with
LNB
value of (0,1,1), or "Pod" in other name. The verse is a spacetime anomaly rather than a proper form of verse; it was created not by
Protoverse
, but by overflowing amount of energy poured into
ATSL Uqraek Fiber
physically pushing the space aside and generating a verse-
like
space inside the pushed-away space.
As a result, the verse is unobservable due to the absence of space and time. However, its size, spin, and influence are still measurable from outside the verse. The radius of a sphere of distorted space around
Auroverse
is its radius, and the direction opposite to its satellites' orbits is the direction of
Auroverse
's spin.
Auroverse
also can influence nearby space by sending the forces through its compressed space surrounding it (which is possible due to compressed space still being the result of a compression of a finite amount of space), so the information can be and is transmitted from out to in and in to out.
Inside the
Auroverse
, time hardly progresses. There are occasional explosions caused by an extremely rare type of
Protoverses
that can ignore the absence of space and wander into Auroverse. The explosion, made by
Protoverse
, allows the time to move while the explosion is attempting to create a proper verse with the existence of space and movement of time.
Auroverse
's physics only allows a few seconds of a lifetime for the new verses before they instantly dissipate away into a cloud of gold and emerald.

Main Compositions
Gold
is the most commonly-found material in this verse, and is the most stable matter in the more dominant set of physics laws. Any sort of atomic matter that emerges inside Auroverse is always, 100% bound to be gold or changed into gold. Golds in Auroverse are inactive to the fullest; no ordinary matter can attempt to interact or react with it without the input of enormous energy to the chemical or physical reactions. They are scattered around the verse, forming seemingly random collections of clusters extending for billions of light years in length.
Emerald
is both the second most and least commonly-found material in this verse.
