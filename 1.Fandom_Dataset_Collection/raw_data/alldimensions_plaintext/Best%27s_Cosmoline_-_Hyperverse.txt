The
hyperverse
in
Best's Cosmoline
has many verses, and verses keep growing in it. It has lots of Interversal Plastic, to allow verses to form, and many
Protoverses
, each housing their own
Proto
, so no entities can destroy the verses, however the verses naturally disintegrate back into Interversal Plastic, so new verses can form. It also has a
Megaverse
in the center. Really nothing else to say.
