Omniverseplexian
is a "supercluster' of
generic omniverses
and other
omniverses
such as
pseudo-omniverses
,
allomniverses
, etc. and also
Omniverseplexes
. Omniverseplexians are very similar to
Boxes
of Omniverses except for some differences:
Size
: Their sizes are WAY bigger than boxes and is also bigger than metaboxial structures, including
cetaverses
. However they only contain omniverses, existent or not.
The Box cannot contain Omniverseplexes and generic omniverses since they are too big for boxes to contain.
Omniverseplexians have got vastly varied density, from one omniverse every

{\displaystyle \omega^{\omega^{\omega}}}
ly (pretty low) to one that is close to each other (so high). But densities with too high numbers do cause a lot of damage and some might even be destroyed forever, which can alter the structures of Omniverseplexes.
Omniverseplexians are endlessly large and only contained by
generic Omegaverses
. Omniverseplexes are a bit like
hyperverses
of omniverses, having random omniverses spread out.
Fractals

Fractals of omniverses are like any other ones you know but only omniverseplexes are the smallest and base of a fractal. Fractals here are not random and are as same as every others else.
