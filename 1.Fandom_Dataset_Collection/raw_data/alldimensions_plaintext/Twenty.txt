Twenty
(a.k.a Wekn'Bad in
yeb wakab kef-waf
) is the 20th lowest post-size verse. It is bigger than
blank
despite being both of them s-transcendent. Guess
EABAs
are stupid after all.
Due to being post-
Basic space
, the verse is basically incoherent and space is irrelevant here. It is still not as chaotic and fucked as
Virvis
is, however, just because it is.
Most entities here act like prokaryotes for some reason. They wander around aimlessly in ways that dont make any sense (because of the distortion of geometry), and they seem to be pretty much mindless.
Our Wekn'Bad also has a ruler, who does nothing all day because it is nigh-impossible to keep any form of order in a verse like this, mostly due to the fact that positions, orientations, and other properties of objects are irrelevant. Aside from that, It acts as a
Hierarchical Tunnel
between the
Eleven Chain
and the
Twenty One Chain
. There is not much else to say about the verse, so that is the end of the page.
