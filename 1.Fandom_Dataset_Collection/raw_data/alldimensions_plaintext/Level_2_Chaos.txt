Level 2 chaos, in the context of chaos theory, refers to systems that are so sensitive to initial conditions that they become unpredictable even when those conditions are known. Unlike

, where predictions about the system can be made with some degree of accuracy, level 2 chaos is profoundly influenced by predictions themselves, making it impossible to accurately forecast. This is the system used by

to make all sorts of
