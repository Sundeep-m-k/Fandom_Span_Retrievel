THE googol dimensions (at most of THE points)
Diameter
THE all sizes with any layers and structures of "meta____", where meta____ is all ____ from -2x the biggest _____ to 2x the biggest _____. This thing is called a "megametameter".
THE the
is like
THE
but so much more THE. THE Everything is so THE here that it repels, causing THE the to have 10x as much of THE void. There is also a lot of THE anti-space here to fit in all of THE void.
To make up for THE lack of THE matter, most matter here is infinitely more dense with THE existance states than
THE fried egg
.
THE objects and THEs in here are made of way more of THE
absolutely tiny atoms
than usual, explaining why they repel THE objects.
THE species in here are very THE and harness THE intelligence. They have built
THE Tower
in order to easily get between -verses without being "too big" or "too small" to observe said -verses.
Multiple
THEs
live here, and tend to collaborate as a large unit, and they all hold
THE Omni-Omni
within them.
