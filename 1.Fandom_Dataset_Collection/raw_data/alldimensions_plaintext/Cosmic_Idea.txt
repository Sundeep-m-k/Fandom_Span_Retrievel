Normal/regular ideas are only capable of manifesting within the minds of a subject, and cannot affect the outside world in any direct way.
However, a "Cosmic Idea", on the other hand, is any idea which is capable of directly affecting both physical and ideatic space. These cosmic ideas also lack the requirement for a "host", more specifically, the individual or subject needed for the continued existence or creation of an idea, and in other words are completely independent. Cosmic ideas MUST affect both physical and ideatic space, and usually do so in very simple ways (there are exceptions). Cosmic Ideas may combine with other ideas to form a larger cosmic idea.
There is no absolute definition on how complex a group of cosmic ideas must be to be identified as an "ideatic complex". However, the general consensus is that any group of cosmic ideas that have demonstrated extremely complex behavior will qualify for the classification. Ideatic complexes may also be sufficiently intricate enough to "infect" and replace other ideas, in which case they are classified as an "Infectious Complex". These complexes may target and dominate weaker ideas. This can occur when an idea complex collides with a host, or group of hosts. Upon contact, the complex may target and remove all "weaker" cosmic/regular ideas from these hosts and replace them with it's own, leading to the host executing the idea if it is suitably powerful.
Cosmic ideas may evolve in processes similar to natural selection, as mutation events occur. Unlike regular ideas, cosmic ideas cannot be neutralized via the destruction of all infected hosts, and can only be neutralized by a "counter concept". Research on these "cosmic ideas" are currently being continued by our organization, in accordance with
