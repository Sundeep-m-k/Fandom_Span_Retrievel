, is the area outside of a
R E S T A U R A N T
.
World is a huge sphere that contains an insane number of R E S T A U R A N T S. Each R E S T A U R A N T is on the surface of World. Layers below the surface are known to be there, but have only been accessed by the strongest of gods.
Life also exists in World. Most of the life lives on the surface, and get their food from the countless R E S T A U R A N T S. Occasionally, huge bursts of energy have been detected below the surface. These energy bursts have damaged a few R E S T A U R A N T S before.
World also has an atmosphere protecting it from the chaotic insides of
K A P P A
. This atmosphere, even though it isn't thick, can still deflect even the strongest of radiation.
