Mark Boredomo was a random human from the universe designated as 10101d who was given powers by an as yet unidentified cosmic entity.  After he discovered the powers, he was given, and when he was bored, he decided to try and do some random things to mess with the people of his Version of Earth which was pretty generic and similar to our own except for him.  He managed to form a group of followers who grew and secretly worshiped him, and he didn't know it and he managed to leave and tried to create a way to explore the rest of his universes and any other nearby universes. This drew the attention of
The Bat-GOD
who decided to put him as a prisoner in
Prison 0101 of the Bat-GOD
until he stopped wanting to be more powerful than he could ever be and wanting everyone to listen to him. He also gets visited sometimes by other versions of himself who are allowed to visit for multiple reasons. He is quite bored and infuriated about his situation. His legacy is still felt on his earth, and a cult of his followers is still around, led by an individual claiming to Mark's long-lost brother. This Cult is also obsessed with power and is determined to try and plan a way to give Mark a way to escape his imprisonment. The Cult hasn't been successful so far in their mission in freeing Mark, however they don't care.
