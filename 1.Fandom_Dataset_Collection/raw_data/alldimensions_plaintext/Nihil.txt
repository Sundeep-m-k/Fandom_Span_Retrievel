Nihil
NIHIL
, the nothingness god of all
voids
! What is he? Well, nihil and how he was made is kinda weird, there is not a lot of info on him since he is literally nothing like a walking living breathing void in the
allsphere
, he is not a destroyer god by any means, he is a creator god actually, expanding and creating anything with a attribute of nothing (even if it's a -5 class particle of nothingness attribute) and wait... Literally everything in the allsphere has some sense of nothingness in it so it means, he can create Jerald Banes(wtf), Nihil Lore ↓
Lore:
[

Bro he is nothing tf u do expect
Nihil was made by
Jerald
after
Ultimatæum The Supremaus Aeternum
and before any other jerald family member or something, like before the allsphere(nihil could have potentially created the
in between
) and stuff I guess, Nihil Governs The Borders of The Allsphere and The Nothingness around it, nihil has infinite counters, parries, repellent to any and all powers, So Complete Arsenal isn't doing anything to nihil, Nihil is far extremely powerful, makes sense because he has 12% of jerald's power which is a DAMN ton of power, like what da hell?! Nihil defies every single rule of the allsphere (makes sense, he has 12% of jerald's power) and nihil power list is in there ↓↓↓↓

(These are either simplified
OR
innacurate
OR
irrelevant to him)
Nihil controls All nothingness and I don't mean the void, I mean ALL NOTHINGNESS every single particle in the allsphere has a sense of nothingness in it, THAT MEANS NIHIL CONTROLS
EVERYTHING
(not just nothingness) this still doesn't describe his stupidly infinitely Mini-Jerald levels of infinite power, Nihil exists COMPLETELY outside of THE ALLSPHERE and is beyond the concepts of existence and nonexistence. As such, the statement of "
He is all and by that, he is everything
"(End all be alls) holds no merit(the end all be all statement means nothing). Nothing in The Allsphere, including its principles, Rules, Laws, Anything, have any power over Nihil at all, THEREFORE not even the concept of something being boundless(not being bound to anything) has any meaning nor merit or worth or power over even a nanoparticle of Nihil. Boundlessness as a concept only applies to things within The Allsphere, nothing outside the allsphere would follow such a rule as that rule is absolutely nothing to Nihil, Nihil Expands The Allsphere and is The One Governing it's borders
