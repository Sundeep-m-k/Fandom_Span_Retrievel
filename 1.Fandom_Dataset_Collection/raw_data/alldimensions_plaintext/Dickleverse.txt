The
dickleverse
was an alternate reality discovered by Herbert Von Dickle in the year 1866, after a mishap involving a steam powered automobile prototype accidentally formed a portal to another universe. The dickleverse is said to be occupied by a "peculiar race of small, midget like red people, who wear astronaut outfits and often kill each other for fun."
Due to the dickleverse's similarity to the hit block building sandbox game
Among Us
created by Gabe Newel, the dickleverse has gained traction in recent years. Other visitors besides Mr.Dickle have visited it in recent years, leading to a string of dickleverse related homicides, in which the midget people will often kill the unfortunate traveler and asphyxiate them with their own cut off genitals. They say they are sick of being culturally appropriated through the game
Among Us
and claim they will begin exiting the portal and attacking humans in the normal world if the memes don't stop.
One dickleverse leader said in a public statement on March 14 2021:
"We and our people are sick of the "memes". This "Jerma" dude is the main instigator. He is basically Hitler to us. We must put up with mocking and crude depictions of our people in your video games and pop culture. We demand reparation. If not, the
real
imposters will soon get what's coming to them. Do not think we have not heard of Lorena Bobbitt."
"We are coming for you."
All expeditions to the dickleverse have been halted until further backup is requested.
