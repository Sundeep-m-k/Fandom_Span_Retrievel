〽️ (or

) is a constant way beyond any regular one.

its equation (as you can see) is to show how much it exalts itself automatically(this is done every less than a one infiniteth of a voidsecond) so by default it is EXTREMELY big and somehow manages to surpass the The
The Nihilthematical - ⧈
so much that it makes the Nihilthematical look "finite" in comparison, this constant is the total amount of
dewdrops
that the
Imperceivable Plane
has, including the total mass and density, 〽️ doesn't just have one equation but so many equations to exalt itself, it's beyond enumeration, any idea of number and scale at all, it's even beyond it's own concept which is absolutely impossible but 〽️ doesn't care about what we think, it exalts itself no matter what, its beyond what numbers are supposed to be and over all, pretty big
