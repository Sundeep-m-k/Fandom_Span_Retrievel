The MOOM is a very large verse, which has the same cosmological structure as the Moon on one half, but the second half is the same as the first half but mirrored. Of course, the MOOM is still much larger than
The Moon
.
Transition
[
]
The transition between the first half and the second half is exact. While the transition is very sudden, it would be difficult to locate it if you were teleported to a random place near the transition, since the transition would be about as smooth as the rest of the MOOM itself.
Scale

Everything in the MOOM half is the same as the Moon, but larger. This makes a single quantum foam very large. Each foam, however, is the same structure as the Moon, and when a part in the moon moves, the same movements happen in the MOOM. This is probably due to the quantum connections between a moon and a MOOM this large, and it also could be that the MOOM is the same as the moon but larger, as seen in
U N I V E R S E
, but mirrored in the middle. Therefore, it is a very strange verse.
