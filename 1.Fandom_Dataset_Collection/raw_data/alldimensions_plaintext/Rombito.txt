Rombito is one of the 3 most powerful
Rendians
(he is the second) rombito and the other rendians have no origin, not even created by any of the creators, rombito specifically has apeirotranscended himself to gain those abilities and immunities, he has multiple versions of himself across different communities, but this one is the most powerful out of all rombito versions (not to be confused with out of all rendinas), rombito is a nullifier, nullifiers are beyond gods and lords.
