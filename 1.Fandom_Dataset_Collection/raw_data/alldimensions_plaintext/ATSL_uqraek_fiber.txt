ATSL uqraek fiber
→
Atomic fabric
ATSL Uqraek fiber is fiber so unfathomably small and unstable that it can not be tracked with any type of technology. Our
Univ
erse
made entirely of absolutely tiny ATSL Uqraek fiber would almost instantly go into a state of "explosion" due to instability and the number of collisions between objects so small. It is too small to contain actual -verses, unlike the
Uqraek
fiber
.

Although there are so many uses for the
Coconut
Tree!
ATSL Uqraek fiber, their main functions are majorly four. For the
ver
ses
,
other
particles
, every force except gravity-like ones, and
proto
verses
. ATSL Uqraek fibers are not necessarily required factors for four major things it helps, but ATSL Uqraek fiber is a huge supporter of them. Oh, and because ATSL Uqraek fibers bonded in large quantity explodes, it cannot be 100% helper.
⌬
1st supported: Verses
: ATSL Uqraek fibers commonly concentrate in regions near verse
[

]
, and this helps verses. Although a large amount of fibers concentrating around the verse leads to
the destruct
ion of it
[
3
]
, a moderate amount of ATSL Uqraek fiber helps to increase the overall energy income
[
4
]
. ATSL Uqraek fiber does a great job at this, and keeps the verse from exploding!
⌬
2nd supported: Other particles
: From the
cocopalm
family!
matter particles to the energy particles, ATSL Uqraek fiber is basically keeping the small matter and energy particles from disintegrating. Although ATSL Uqraek fiber cannot help particles below its grid size, it is a great packer for materials making up matter and energy particles
[

]
.
⌬
3rd supported: All forces except gravity-like ones
: Because ATSL Uqraek fiber is keeping particles alive, every single natural force is greatly benefitting from ATSL Uqraek fiber,
whether they w
ant it or not
. However, that's not all; ATSL Uqraek fiber makes up force fields themselves!
un
pog
for gravity-like forces... they operate only with space, meaning ATSL Uqraek fiber cannot be any help for them :(
⌬
4th supported: Protoverses
:
Proto
verses
can explode
[

]
if the energy stored in them is bigger than the energy capacity of its shield
[
7
]
. And ATSL Uqraek fiber gives little help to them. By drawing nearby energy and giving it all to protoverse, ATSL Uqraek fiber becomes little help at establishing a garden of nature made by verses

ok ok it is the black hole that is exploding not the verse but it is close enough

incoming energy particles. No extra energy is released upon annihilation, because the
space around annihilat

But uqraek fiber cannot completely obscure small cracks that particles' inner materials can flow out. When it happens, minuscule energy is released. by "minuscule", I mean energy of typical dynamite. But instead of just releasing it, uqraek fiber stores it all in space around release site!

well, obviousely, to form verses
↑
this thing exists to avoid protoverses from all exploding and everywhere to the end of physics being filled with chaos
↑
Although too much verses concentrated at one area can lead to total destruction of the space someday, but who cares if visual gets more and more pleasing!
