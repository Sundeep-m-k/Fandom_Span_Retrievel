The cut
[
]
The cut of the universe is a place of anomalies in the universe, containing a tremendous amount of quantum energy. The universe cut can, with this huge amount of energy, potentially teleport objects or organisms into the
megaverse
. Nothing can survive in the cut without being destroyed.
The formation
[
]
The cut was created during the creation of the
big bang
. All the energy from the big bang spilled out, and a cluster of energy that compressed to create quantum energy. Then that energy pulled that cluster apart, creating a chain reaction. This chain reaction created a huge explosion, which made the cut of the universe.
Anomalies
[
]
A number of anomalies have taken place in the universe cut. These strange phenomena have participated in the creation of certain universes, such as the
Zextreverse
.
— The group
This anomaly is simply a group of galactic shadows floating in space. These shadows began to appear in the centre of the cut, creating a population of strange creatures. These galactic shadows do not move, and they do not live, but they reject a rather large quantity of dark matter in the universe. This release of dark matter proves dangerous for the progression of space, as it sucks in planets, even entire galaxies. These shadows still continue to appear in the cut.
— Black holes
Another phenomenon that turns out to be quite strange is an appearance of black holes. Huge black holes appear, as with the galactic shadows, in the center of the cut. These black holes suck everything around them, especially quantum energy. However, they do not manage to engulf the galactic shadows.
