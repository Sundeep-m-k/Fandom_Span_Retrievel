LOGIC1:Scaling

to beat this being is to make a variant of it.
Asterisk (*) is a beyond E.A.B.A hyperusual entity, its power is beyond the concepts of infinity, its abilities strictly cannot be countered, it’s theorized that it rules over the wiki itself, it has multiple variants, category of variants
here
, and can win against
「God」
as it isn’t purely fictional and can be manifested into reality via beliefs.
