Mandelsok (or mandelbrotstuffisok) is a container for various anomalies, along with countless
tiny particles
[
3
]
. It is also one of the most complicated particles. In fact, there are
so many
particles floating around inside Mandelsok, it almost looks like a normal verse (if one had the
ability to look "inside of mandelsok"
)!

You might have thought of mandelsok as a
laaaaaame container for completely unrelated things that can only contain others
. But that's
a little
off from what it actually is. Mandelsok quite behaves like some sort of living being, but still as one constructor of reality
[
4
]
.
With its negative-property size allowing it to contain
literal freaking verse
just reversed in size
[
5
]
, an immense amount of
N
P
S
S
{\displaystyle NPSS}
- size particles can be crammed into Mandelsok. Mandelsok uses these particle buds to prevent itself from getting destroyed to
building and destroying anything it desires
.
۞Ability 1. To... Think
and evolve...?
: Quite hard to imagine this small
shit that is +1 to an
already huge list of particles
particle being able to have consciousness eh? Well, it IS possible with brand new tinybrain
TM
! reverse-size
○
,
Thingk
,  and
⬤
is concentrated inside mandelsok, and by forming some sort of interacting fiber network
[
6
]
that allows Mandelsok to think and evolve.
۞Ability 2. self-sustain and protection
: Since space is mostly filled with positive-sized objects, Mandelsok is basically having an
instant-kill minefield
all around it
[
7
]
. To avoid colliding with death bombs
[
8
]
, mandelsoks place
negative-sized repulsive particles
around their border. Also, mandelsoks stabilize themselves by placing another bunch of repulsive particles at the center. Balance formed. Oooooh!!
Yeahhhhhhh boyyyyyyy
[
9
]
.
۞Ability 3. expanding and contracting space to move around
[
10
]
:
This particle
can attract space,
even though it has a negative size
. The space attraction of Omnipocket is just SOOOO minuscule but it is enough to create a tiny tiny warp drive for mandelsok
[
11
]
. It helps mandelsoks "eat" other smaller minuscule objects for resources
[
12
]
.
۞Ability 4. controlling NPSS-scale world
: Believe it or not,
negative space
[
13
]
is crowding with tiny tiny particles. In fact, a negative scale is even richer than a positive space in terms of particle scale. There are
tiny tiny
structures and verses scattered across a scale of the realm where Mandelsok is located. Mandelsok can manipulate everything of them, granting mandelsok
a great power
to manipulate objects below and above.
۞Ability 5. Power to bring its imaginations to reality
: Some mandelsoks's scales are
unimaginably close to 0
[
14
]
, and those unique sorts of mandelsok can contain
big brains
[
15
]
. They are not smol and cute living particles anymore, they are now brains of monstrous hyper-intelligences. At first, the creature begins
extremely smol
, just with few positive-size particles stuck to mandelsok. Then, as it grabs more and bigger particles, the creature gets celestially, no,
OMNIVERSALLY
powerful
[

But hey
, mandelsok is not just a drifting biological bomb producing gigantic omniverse eaters
[
18
]
; they also play important roles! Mandelsoks are cleaners for the
negative structures realm
, exploding space preventers, and most importantly, they are the best intelligence source nature has to offer.
۞Cleaners of negative structure realm
: As it is written on the
page
, it can sometimes be overcrowded by a sudden increase of "eggs". When it happens, the realm can easily burst, allowing
countless
dangerous
negative
particles
to enter it. Mandelsoks occasionally enter the region's border without problem, devouring a
massive
[
19
]
amount of eggs each time there are too many eggs.
۞Stabilizers of overcrowded space
: This role of Mandelsok works both for positive and negative spaces. Mandelsok just
c o n s u m e s
overflowing energy stored inside space
[
20
]
, and turns consumed energy into materials for its fabrical brain
[
21
]
. Sometimes,
an error
can happen for mandelsok while it is fixing its brain. When mandelsok is lucky, it will gain enough intelligence to be "
smort
mandelsok" mentioned up there. When it's unlucky...
well
...
۞Naturally-existing exploitable AIs
: Mandelsoks can be reeeeeeeally smart, so smart that they were once enough to gather their surroundings to create a living god. For
civilization
to
exploit
[
22
]
mandelsok, they just need to kill a single mandelsok-brained cosmic creature
[
23
]
[
24
]
! Ok, it's not exactly an easy task, but
an entire civilization is a relatively cheap cost for unlimited intelligence
! Right? :D... right...? D:
۞Anom
alies
inside
mande
lsok
[
]
Mandelsok contains, including all negative-sized particles of
The pre-hierarchy
, lots of "anomalies" which are only found inside mandelsok. As a result of evolving mandelsoks eating up dangerous particles and clumping them into one, anomalies are mostly destructive. However, some are
accidentally
formed omnipotent seeds with the potential to become anything it desires. When mandelsok gets popped by
something
at a barren void, the void will briefly bloom with wonders of nature
[
25
]
[
26
]
.
...And when mandelsok explodes right next to verses, something it does much more commonly, nearby verses are usually
fricked up
.
۞Anomaly #1. Mand
elsok's tinier brains
[
]
This is probably closer to viruses than some kind of brain. Mandelsok's brain creates countless backup parts for its brain floating around its core
[
27
]
. When the backup parts encounter mutation or are broken beyond repair, the central brain of mandelsok decides it is useless
and throws it away
. Pockets of the brain can sometimes collide with particles, turning them into kind of "zombie particles", that are paralyzed by incomplete pieces of the mandelsok brain controlling it
[
28
]
.

۞Anomaly
#2. "Mines"
[
]
"Mines" are something mentioned as "dangerous particles clumping into one". They are at least a little more interesting and useful than useless pieces of
a literal mandelsok shits
I mean mandelsoks's brain. "Mines" get kicked out from mandelsok if they are
big enough
to become a
problem
[
29
]
. In most cases, it's better to die than to stand next to the
negative

of

۞Anomaly #3. quadra
l particle remnant
[
]
One particle, four components. The omnipotent seed to become what it desires. Quadral particle remnants are what mandelsok uses for escaping the most dangerous threats
[
35
]
.
or more like
, crystals of mandelsok's booster smoke. Arrangements of crystals ALWAYS contain four particles of creation. Those four particles tell crystals what to do, such as creating protoverse and exploding into certain verse(s)

No, the mandelsok's border does not

exactly, EXACTLY
how warp drives work

Of course, combined with

Having omnipicket as warp engine also grants mandelsok ability to basically teleport to anywhere.

existence
being negative or positive or more (meaning space with existence rank of 0 does not exist).

ex: -0.0000000...0000000001
↑
I mean, yes, of course, it is brain-like 1D complex of particles which gives mandelsok some sort of intelligence.
↑
end of growth is either weirdly replicating
zedohkay
or, in most cases, WAS monsters roaming inside
The Void of Celestials
.
↑
At this point, mandelsok is just living brain.
b r u h
↑
...technically it is
↑
not the text, only the title.
↑
ATSL uqraek fiber
is great at storing too much energy and instabilizing it, making whole freaking space a
landmine
spacemine.
↑
particles inside mandelsok are perfectly stable except its
thinking part
(a.k.a the only part of mandelsok where it did not steal from outside world). Particles composing unstable brain of mandelsok occasionally evaporates, meaning it
has temporary stroke from time to time
.
↑
"Exploiting" here is said with tone of "harvest", rather than "abusing weak part of something or someone to gain profit". Of course, mandelsok would have killed the civilization if "exploit" was by its original meaning.
↑
It's easy
, huh? :D
↑
mandelsoks that are not the brain of creatures are quite useless, since their intelligence levels are far low to be actual help.
↑
...
before the fire of creation extinguishes and everything in the void disappears into thin cloud of gas
:(
↑
this is, like, the chances of this happening is
EXTREMELY, HILARIOUSLY minuscule
. Most mandelsoks
explode right next to a lot of verses
where big bang is frequent. A good news (for voidsn not for verses or everything else) is that one mandelsok exploding can start chain reaction which ultimately fills the void with active creation processes.
↑
They are used for repairing of mandelsok brain in case it is
seriously damaged
.
↑
Paralyzing effect can control
countless particles
and sometimes
above
.
↑
The negative fabric that forms when mandelsok's mines explode are quite similar to atomic fabric's negative version. Looking at
what atomic fabric does
automatically means mandelsok mines' fabrics are huge headache.
for negative world, of course
.
↑
...negative big bangs are the best to be expected from mandelsok mines.
↑
PART of his realm, and in case of this happening is rare. Which is so lucky, since the
literal gate to hell
mines form only affect negative realm. Consider
pressing F
for entities there :(
↑
Not negative plutfuseverse, but approximately equivalent amount of NPSS radiation. This can occasionally lead to destruction of mandelsok.
↑
Imagine huge pool of
melting and bursting clumps of cells and larvae
drifting through space, growing from eating living entities. Negative zedohkay is even worse, since fabric arranged upon formation of it from mines can grant it intelligence to move or live.
↑
WAIT WHAT
??? EVENTS IN NEGATIVE REALM ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO AFFECT POSITIVE WORLD!!!!!!
WHAT DAY EVEN IS IT, A DOOMSDAY OR APRIL FOOLS
!?!?!?
↑
examples can be
yo mama
yourmomverse's instability, structures' barriers, exploding (positive space's) big bang, or even
little tiny destructive bombs mandelsok had created on its own
.
