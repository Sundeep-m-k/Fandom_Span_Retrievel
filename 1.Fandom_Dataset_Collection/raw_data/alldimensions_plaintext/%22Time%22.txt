"Why is time an inescapable dimension?"
TIME.
Because escaping it would mean instant death. I’m not talking about time as we use it, which is actually just another name for duration. Dimensions are degrees of freedom. Height, length and width all are degrees of freedom in certain spatial directions. Time, is a physical sense which is connected inextricably to space is the dimension that allows the freedom to exist and existence requires motion. Heart beats, blood circulation, vibrations of atoms, molecules and particles. All motion, vibration etc. is only possble because of time and this is where the dumb profs and stupid students get separated from those of us qualified to talk about time. Because you can smack them up side the head with the facts, the experiments, the research that backs those simple facts up and they will still talk about time as if they have a limitation to comprehend how semantics works because that’s all it is. Like I said, “time” as we usually use that word is just another name for ‘duration’ and I’m going to prove it, right now. “What day is it?” Wednesday? OK. 48 hours away from Sunday and 72 hours before the next Sunday. What time is it? Noon? OK, 12 hours into the day. And so on. All those things have to do with ‘duration’. They have nothing to do with anything connected to the space time continuum. I’ll prove it. In physics there is a significant issue called the asymmetry of time problem.
What that means is that physicists can do the math equations that describe actions going forward and backwards, but they never see a reversal in real life and it has caused problems for them for decades. The solution is that time doesn’t flow in either direction. The purpose of time is to allow everything else to flow, to move on every scale in every space in existence. Time doesn’t have an action or make anything do anything else. You know how we usually measure “time” in days, weeks, years, and hours? Well, duration is all relative. You ask what time it is, someone tells you it’s 12:00 PM. That’s just the framework we’ve created, but it doesn’t even begin to touch on the actual role time plays in our existence. Sure, on Earth, it’s noon. But what happens when you start talking about the larger scope of time across dimensions? That’s where things get complicated. Now, you’ve heard of the asymmetry of time, right? It’s that pesky issue in physics where we can reverse the equations that describe events, but the events themselves never reverse. It’s a paradox. Why? Because time doesn’t flow in the way we think it does. Time isn’t forward or backward. It’s constant. It’s neutral. It’s an endless wave that allows everything else to move in any direction, across any space, across any dimension. Time doesn't "do" anything. It just enables. Without it, the universe would be frozen in place.
Time, in its purest essence, doesn't care for your desire to control it. You cannot manipulate it, slow it down, or skip ahead, no matter how advanced your technology or how powerful your understanding. The laws of time operate independently of your will. The only thing you can do is exist within it and move along with it. It carries all things forward, relentlessly, without mercy, and without fail.
The issue, however, is that most beings don’t truly comprehend this.
They may grasp the notion of time in a superficial way, think they can bend it, or even outsmart it. But in the grand design, time doesn’t bend, break, or respond to anything. It is absolute. You are subject to it, as is every particle, every star, and every universe in existence. The moment you believe you can control time or escape it, you’ve already lost. You’ve fallen into a lie, and that’s when time will become your undoing.
And if you look closely enough at the fine-tuned interactions of existence itself, you’ll realize that time isn’t simply tied to existence, it is existence. It is the fabric that brought all of existence into being. The heartbeat of every organism, the vibration of every particle, the oscillation of energy in the universe is orchestrated by the rhythm of time. Time is the pulse of reality. If you were to truly escape time, you would cease to exist in the way that you do now. You would be lost to an incomprehensible nothingness. That’s why it’s inescapable, it’s the foundation of everything. You can’t simply break from it like stepping out of a room. There is no “outside” to time, no “before” or “after” to escape to. It is not a concept to be toyed with. It is a force that can’t be challenged, and any attempt to do so will lead to destruction.
People love to talk about time travel, how they wish they could move backward or forward, change their mistakes or witness history firsthand. But that's a pipe dream. Time doesn’t bend or break for anyone. You can alter your perception of it, sure, but those changes will always fall within its framework. Time isn't kind or cruel. It doesn't have emotions.
You’re not the one who defines it. You’re not the one who controls it. Time defines you. Time controls you.
For those who believe they can evade it, time will always have the last laugh. Time is also about Purpose. Every being, every system in existence has a timeline, a path, a role in
Everything
. You may not understand it, but that doesn’t make it any less true. You can manipulate it, maybe even stretch it a bit. But in the end, time will always win. It is the axis upon which
Everything
turns. Without it, nothing would exist. There would be no past, no future, just an eternal present, which, frankly, is something no one could endure.
The passage of time erases things. It erodes. It destroys. In that sense, time is the most honest force in existence. It will continue whether you want it to or not.
And that’s what makes time inescapable. Without it, you wouldn’t be here to argue about it. Neither would I. Neither would anyone. So, no. You can't escape time. You wouldn’t survive it. And that, my dear, is a universal truth.
Only asian moms can stop time for an unknown reason.
