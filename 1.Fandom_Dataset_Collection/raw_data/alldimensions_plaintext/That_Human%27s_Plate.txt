About
[

A
That Human's Plate
is a plate used by a
That Human
, which holds
Fried Eggs
for That Human to eat. Although these cosmic plates are insanely large, they're still very weak in comparison to
Pans
and the rest of their
Other Rooms
.
They usually have a napkin and fork next to them at all times, unless their That Human is eating a Fried Egg. A That Human's Plate is switched out every megaweek to be washed, while another Plate takes their place. Unwashed Plates go in
Sinks
.
Fried Egg amount
[
]
They usually has 2-3 Fried Eggs on them at any given time, though extremely rare instances of 4 Fried Eggs being in a That Human's Plate because their That Human is very hungry have been spotted more than once.
This has very little going for them, as they're made of the same omega porcelain as
Bowls
and are constantly raided by
Ants
.
Heat
[
]
While not as extreme, a That Human's Plate can be very hot for multiple megadays when introduced to a fresh Fried Egg, as it holds heat somewhat well. When it is cooled, the Ants are almost always all over it unless they notice That Human, in which case they run. This very large omega porcelain plate holds a very small amount of cracks where the heat is much lower. There are occasionally bits of Fried Egg in here which make these cracks some of the safest places in their RGB Box.
Trivia
[
]
There is only one recorded case of 5 Fried Eggs being on a That Human's plate, and straight up no recorded cases of there being 6 or more of them. Similarly, there are no recorded cases of there being only 1 Fried Egg either.
