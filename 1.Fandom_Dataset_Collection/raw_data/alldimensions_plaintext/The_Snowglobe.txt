The snowglobe is reality
. Nothing within the Snowglobe can exist outside it, if it is not transcendent or created by a Transcendite. If anything within it for say
The Box
escapes it will be deleted from existence. The Snowglobe is really big, but it isn't the biggest.
The snowglobe is so large and even contains the impossible hierarchy, it’s the entirety of reality except for a few things.
It’s just so big, anything that leaves is destroyed because it’s reality. The beings outside are the strongest known.
