α is a particle that absorbs
ζs
. When the size reaches 1,000,000
ζs
, and a certain amount of time has passed (usually 10 seconds), it will split into two smaller αs, and the energy will create a third α of the same size as the two smalller αs.
α is attracted to
ζs
and other αs, due to the fact that it survives by asorbing objects. If α is left empty, then it will collapse into
xoꓭ ǝʜT
. It can still collapse even if it isn't empty, but there is a lower probability of α collapsing the more full it is.
α takes logic and physics from within whatever it contains and changes it accordingly. Here are some noteworthy αs:
α structure
Property
256 or more layers of αs
The αs will suddenly absorb a random
The Box
. This lasts for 10 minutes (due to broken logic) before the α returns back to normal. What is meant by "normal" here is "exploding into 256 αs but not containing
The Box
".
1,000 to 100,000
ζs
The α will become sentinent, and will merge with other αs to increase power. It might even try to grow layers in order to become even more powerful, and might even evolve into a
Sentient Substance
if enough αs become sentinent in a molecule.
10 or more layers of 100 to 1,000
ζs
The α will repel practically everything instead of absorbing things like it usually does. It will also grow really fast (2x size in one second).
100,000 to 1,000,000
ζs
It starts splitting but in the end, it will always split into 2 and the energy making a third.
