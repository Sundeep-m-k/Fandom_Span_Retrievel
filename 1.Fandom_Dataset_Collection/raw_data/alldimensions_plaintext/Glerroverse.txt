The glerroverse,is a verse that is surprisingly small.It has a weird shape.It is like a spiral and line combination.
It has a core in the middle that makes it alive.
Life
[
]
It lives by eating other smaller verses. It basiclly eats in a rather weird way. See those lines? if a verse touches it,it will be sucked into the core in seconds,giving it even more life span and energy.But you cant call this verse "old" Cause its only 124 years old.Thats why its so small.It will evolve in the future.
