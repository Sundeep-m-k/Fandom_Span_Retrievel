The
ketchupverse
is a
verse
found in
spaghettiverse
. It is all
mostly
"ketchup" (its a bit see-through and not as thick), since researchers found that
mustardverses
also reside in the ketchupverse.
The ketchupverse will mostly look boring since its jumostly just pure red, but if there was enough chaos for the mustardverse, it may eventually lose its round, bubble-like shape and become a spiral, which is a bit interesting to see in the ketchupverse, as its pretty stable to cause much effect on the mustardverse.
Also, its a place where tourists may come to explore just to see the spiral mustardverses.
Not much else is known.
