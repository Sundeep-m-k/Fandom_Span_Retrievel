Thingk
is the only component for minuscule fabrics. Every fabric of reality
[

can be
broken down
into one component particle: the Thingk. These specks of dust
[

bind to each other and create every sort of fabric EVERY. Similar to
ATSL strings
, Thing produces different fabrics by vibrating and arranging in various combinations.

The first vital property of thingk is vibration. Vibration for Thingk, like
ATSL strings
, creates all the visuals and properties of fabrics
[
5
]
. Visual is determined by four different types of vibrations
[
6
]
, while the property is determined by a certain range of Thingk
vibration from 0 to max finity
.

is four variables: (Physical, Spacial, Energy, Dimensional)

۞Nonexistent / PSED:
(

{\displaystyle (0,0,0,0)}
: It's simple, this is not a fabric. Of course, you don't call something with "nothing", a "thing". Only blank space exists here, and the "fabric" of space itself is probably the only fabric with this PSED.
۞Point fabric / PSED:
(

0
,
0

0
)
{\displaystyle (1,0,0,0)}
: Vibrating Thingks scattered at small radius automatically
and magically
[
13
]
forms fabrics of their own. Although that fabric may be fragile, it has great flexibility. You can expect to find them in space with a low (
but never zero
) concentration of Thingks.
۞Fuzzy fabric / PSED:
(
0
,
1
,
0
,
0
)
{\displaystyle (0,1,0,0)}
: Theoretically
[
14
]
, Thingk can have vibration through space without having any physical vibration at all. Space excited around Thingk will form a loosely connected cloud-like fabric. Fuzzy fabric is really fragile
[
15
]
, breaking into pieces even by sweep from small movement.
۞Linear fabric
/ PSED:
(
0

0
,
1
,
0
)
{\displaystyle (0,0,1,0)}
: Thingk can sometimes be sending out little tiny energy waves acting as a sort of vibration. The energy radiating from Thingk is multiple static streams, but it looks more like a gigantic soup-boiling pot shot with several
Railguns
[
16
]
[
17
]
. Especially strong energy streams can be connected with other thingks, forming fabric. Quite stable fabric actually, since energy streams tightly lock onto other thingk once it heads in right direction.
۞Chaotic fabric
/ PSED:
(
0

{\displaystyle (0,0,0,1)}
: When the composer of all fabrics

, they can resonate between
all dimensions
[

. Forms of Chaotic fabric is not regular, but mostly a jumble of blurry sphere

۞Cloudy cluster fabric
/ PSED:
(
1
,
1
,
0
,
0
)
{\displaystyle (1,1,0,0)}
: This is a normal state for fabrics with Fuzzy fabric properties.  Physical resonation sends ripples of excitation through nearby space, which forms cloudy fabric with a few scattered Thingks
[

.
۞Network fabric
/ PSED:
(
1

0
,
1
,

)
{\displaystyle (1,0,1,0)}
: This is closest to what can usually be called "

". Resonating Thingks are connected with bridges made from energy radiating from them and are very stable since they are really similar to common
molecules
.
۞Low-density fabric
/ PSED:
(
1
,
0

0

1
)
{\displaystyle (1,0,0,1)}
: Well... this fabric is
not low density, but visuals are
. Every single Thingk of so-called "Low-density fabric" violently resonates through countless dimensions each moment, but are all connected by Point fabric. This results in weird Point fabric with impossibly low density, where composer Thingks instantly
pop and disappear into nowhere
[

]
.
۞Thundercloud fabric
/ PSED:
(
0
,
1
,
1
,
0
)
{\displaystyle (0,1,1,0)}
: The name does a good job at expressing how this fabric looks. Among the spacial cloud of fuzzy fabrics, unstable energy bond struggles to form linear connections. However, unlike normal linear fabric, energy bonds get distracted by fuzzy fabric. This results in a fuzzy fabric with energy streams dashing inside it like lightning.
۞Scattered clouds
/ PSED:
(

: Linear fabrics always, and are bounded to form some sort of symmetrical polygonal edges. And do you know what happens when linear fabric fluctuates between dimensions?
Edge numbers go up and down like crazy

۞Advanced network fabric
/ PSED:
(
1

{\displaystyle (1,1,1,0)}
: Addition to bridged point thingks, there is now an energy cloud enveloping them. Advanced network fabrics are mostly fragile fabrics with no strong connections between their components.
understandable
, considering that even Line+Cloud fabric is unstable
and now thingks are vibrating
.
۞Order fabric / PSED:
(

{\displaystyle (0,1,1,1)}
: "Dramatic" fabrics form ordered shapes when they have ripples of energy surrounding them. Energy flows inside changing line structures, and

according to natural properties of Dramatic fabric, they form order.
۞Evolving network fabric
/ PSED:
(
1
,
0
,
1
,
1
)
{\displaystyle (1,0,1,1)}
: Hmm, what does "evolving network" here refer to? Evolving (changing between countless dimensions)
culture of memes
, or a
world of it
? Or a natural-forming environment of scattered vibrating thingks and linear streams? Surprisingly, it is the latter.
۞Superspeed fabric
/ PSED:
(
1

1
,
0
,

)
{\displaystyle (1,1,0,1)}
: Scattered cloud fabric contains a fuzzy fabric with a lot of energy. Individual thingks sometimes has chance to absorb that "lot of energy" when everything is in place, occasionally being accelerated into ridiculous speed.
So basically... Fuzzy fabric on drugs

"Oh, so you want to hold more?"

The first restriction card of thingks to fabrics is: "LAW No.1 FOR FABRICS BEYOND 0 to 1vibe/OYC: Do whatever you want EXCEPT absorbing energy amount beyond finite". The law is also applied to

:
Then, is it the only restriction for mysterious infinite energy sources? Nah. As said in the vibration range description, lower 2nd vibration range fabrics radiate energy in various forms
[
32
]
. Because thingk bonds are quite weak, all about the same or weaker than 0 to 1 vibe/OYC fabrics, they cannot allow the fabric to radiate energy in the single-shock form
[

. Or else, the fabric will instantly dissolve.

So far, the topic was only focused on vibrations of thingks. It's true that Thingk fiber is
impressive and all
, but what can non-vibrating, individual Thingks do? Surely not nothing, right? yes
[
47
]
. In fact, they can do many activities! Most of the activities are attaching to other particles and being a helper
[
48
]
.
۞First Function, stabilizers of space
:
Sometimes, maniacs such as exploding
protoverse
or unstable fabrics' explosion can break space
[
49
]
. There are many fabrics and particles keeping that from happening, such as
ATSL Uqraek fiber
[
50
]
. But basically almost all work of "keeping space alive" is done by randomly floating individual Thingks. Because Thingks have a negative mass, they absorb the energy around them when they are destroyed by an energetic event
[
51
]
[
52
]
.
۞Second Function, annihilator of dangerous particles
:
ATSL elementary particles
,
Protoverses
,
Pencils
... there are so many dangerous particles popping out of nowhere and demanding destruction. Like antibodies of space itself, Thingks can annihilate dangerous particles. The main way Thingks do so is by simply colliding with them
[
53
]
.
۞Third Function, flex tape for bigger particle structures
:
Particles and structures of them are bonded by flowing Thingks stream at the tiniest scale. If you zoom in far enough into any particle, they will be composed of flowing Thingk streams +
other tiny tiny elementary particles

renders a seemingly empty space
[

. In a nutshell, this class is for garbage Thingks.
۞Class 2

approx: 70% cringe, 30% masterpiece
:
Class 2 is where Thingk arrangement at the border of
atomic fabric
and Class 1 Thingk structures are.
Kurzgesagt
[
58

, Class 2 Thingk structures are majorly unhelpful but the ones that unintentionally become help.
۞Class 3
/
approx: 50% cringe, 50% masterpiece
:
If
Uqraek fiber
and
ATSL uqraek fiber
was Thingk structure, it would be placed here. It means they are
sort of helpers, but not entirely
. Also from class 3 and on, Thingk structures gain at least some form of ordered connections
[
59
]
.
۞Class 4
/
approx: 30% cringe, 70% masterpiece
:
Orders become clearly observable
[

and Thingk structures become actual help for bigger objects; such as fundamental particles made from thingks
[

.
۞Class 5
/
approx: 0% cringe, 100% masterpiece
:
This maybe the rarest kinds among countless Thingk networks, since almost every "helping" function are done by Thingk fabrics. However, some are helpful as most helper fabrics, such as exciting protoverse so it can create new verse

It looks so obvious, but is actually not if viewed from
Omniverse

perspective. Those nasty (?) objects usually contain every single possible and impossible things. This includes something
existing, not existing

cannot do anything
when it does not exist.

Single-shock can mean many things. Obviously, explosion is included, so is energy bursts. Thankfully, the small restriction keeps everything near high-energy fabric from obliterating whatever it is close to.

...which is actually something like
