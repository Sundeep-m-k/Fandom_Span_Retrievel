Theres not much known about The real reality (often nicknamed the true real reality to prevent confusion with the
real reality
) but heres whats known:
a diagram of the real reality (because of my crappy MS paint diagram, to see the text, click on the image, also the green text says protoverse)
To the True real reality, everything else smaller than it combined is only the size of a
Blueprint Particle
Its temperature is somewhere around 36.6 degrees celsius (all the extremely cold and extremely hot temperatures balanced themselves out)
It glows in red (shown in the diagram)
It was apparently made by
someone
to keep everything from spreading out too much, in other words a barrier
Inside the barrier the "sky" looks a bit dark blue and there are the occasional white spheres, resembling clouds
And that only the creator of this barrier could teleport outside of it, but rarely does because theres literally nothing there
side note, if you want its size, its so large, it actually needs its own unit: @#, in other words the atantag unit
Contains:

The infinite void

The factorial chain
Note:
after some investigation with a supercomputer, theres an actual creator of the real reality,
