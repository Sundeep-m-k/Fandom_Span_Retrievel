The Spinverse is a small verse that spins at an insane speed, 1 rotation per
Voidsecond
. Due to the insane rotation speed of the Spinverse, it has many strange phenomenon and even has a debris ring around it. The Spinverse also has massive gravity.
The Spinverse has a very strange interior. Somehow, objects inside the Spinverse can fly everywhere due to the spinning speeds, which should not happen. However, the speed that the Spinverse spins at is so insanely fast that its effects can be felt inside it.

The Debris Ring
Structure
[
]
Due to the spinning effect of the Spinverse, the inside of the Spinverse is extremely chaotic. Objects crashing into each other is a very common and reoccurring thing, and tons of debris are constantly being ejected out of the Spinverse.
Stars
[
]
Stars in the Spinverse are not very common, but they can still form. Stars here are able to hold themselves together when crashing into another object, and also have over twice the gravity of a normal star in order to not fly around so much.
Planets
[
]
Planets in the Spinverse are also rare, since most new planets will immediately get hit with space debris, obliterating the planet entirely. Unlike the stars in the Spinverse, Planets in it do not have special properties that can allow them to hold themselves together when hitting an object, so most planets are extremely short-lived.
The Debris Ring
[
]
Unlike most verses, the Spinverse has a ring around it. This ring is not particularly big or nice-looking, and is composed of mostly dust, with traces of iron and hydrogen. The reason this ring of debris is kept in place is because of the Spinverse's massive gravity counteracting its insane spinning speed, balancing out each other and creating an equilibrium. This equilibrium allows the ring to stay in place.
