A
timeline
is a way in which time stabilizes and goes in a certain direction. without timelines, everything would descend into chaos.
There are many categories of timelines, listed below:

Types of Timelines
[
]
Standard Timeline
[
]
A standard timeline.
This type of timeline is a straight flow of time, having a start and an end. This is by far the most stable kind of timeline, hosting the majority of structures.
Fluctuant Timeline
[
]
This kind of timeline is on the verge of splitting into more timelines. These timelines often have an unstable flow of time.
Looped Timeline
[
]
This kind of timeline is in a perpetual loop, resetting to how it was a while ago in a endless cycle.
n-Looped Timeline
[
]
This type of timeline has a loop that repeats a finite amount of times.
Mixed Timeline
[
]
A mixed timeline refers to a timeline that starts out as one type, but switches to another. (e.g. a timeline starts out standard, but starts to loop infinitly at the end.)
True Timeline
[
]
A true timeline is a timeline that goes on infinitly backwards and forwards in time with no start or endpoints. Loops do not count as points, and therefore cannot revoke True Timeline status. If a timeline splits, it will not lose True Timeline status unless all resulting timelines end. If a timeline results from two timelines combining, at least one of the timelines must not have a begining for the resulting timeline to be a True Timeline.
Timeray
[
]
A timeray is a timeline that continues infinitly in one direction, but not the other. These can be split into Class Epsilon, where the timeray has a beginning, but no end, or Class Upsilon, where the timeray has an end, but no beginning. Loops, as mentioned before, do not count as start or endpoints.
Timesegment
[
]
A timesegment has both a beginning and an end. Timesegments can have loops, assuming the loop is in the middle, and not the beginning or end.
Multidimensional Time
[
]
Multidimensional Time (i.e. when d>1, where d=# of time dimensions) is a very complicated subject which cannot be fully explained without the article bloating to a size too large for a random person to willingly read. For more information, check out
Timeplane
,
Timespace
, and
Non-Euclidean Time
. Please note that any timecurve which is not interacting with any other timecurve is identical to a timeline from the prepective of someone in the timecurve. For further information, look at
Conic Sections of Time
,
Trigonometric Funtions of Time
, and
List of Timecurves
. For relationships inbetween timelines in higher dimensional time, see
Relationships Between Timelines
.
Extended Timelines
[
]
Beyond the standard concept of time, we may see nested versions of timelines.

Regular timelines. These are often stable and is where many objects reside.
Also is represented by
Time and reality
in spatial dimensions,
due to timelines not being stable anywhere else.
-0
(Para-Time)
Timelines at this level follow a corrupted version of logic that creates many paradoxes, creating widespread chaos.
1
(Metatime)
These type of timelines often are accompanied by voids and strange structures. This kind of time is home to many
Finality-4
objects.
-1
(Subtime)
Timelines at this level most commonly are home to negative sized particles, such as
Heaa
or
Verseuni
.
2
(Megatime)
These type of timelines are very unstable, and often split into other types of timelines.
-2
(Microtime)
Timelines at this level often contain
Absolutely tiny particles
. Many of these timelines are the most stable there is.
