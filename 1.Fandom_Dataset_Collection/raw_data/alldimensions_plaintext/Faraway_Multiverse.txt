Faraway Multiverse
[
]
FM is commonly known as the Faraway Multiverse, due to a multi-universal survey conducted by Maqßo Plidḁ in 899 OYC to see the average size of universes in a 12
131
ly radius. However, due to an as of yet unknown error, the FM
[

specifically was registered as part of the list and subsequently included into the equations and resulting answer in Plidḁ's paper "The Average Sizes of Local Universes".
This error was seen about 1.21
OYC
after the survey, when Ħida⅁ Fȉdal was looking through the data. Fȉdal noticed that the FM's observed location within the data did not match up with the range the survey intended to cover, with cross-referencing proving this. Fȉdal would later publish an article covering this named "An Error Found within Maqßo Plidḁ's work", which would popularize it and make it a popular tourist destination at the time. Due to its distance, it earned the name "Faraway Multiverse". The data would be corrected, brought up-to-date, and republished as "The Updated Average Sizes of Local Universes".
Pldiḁ-Fȉdal Multiverse

The last names of Maqßo Plidḁ and Ħida⅁ Fȉdal, the ones who mentioned/used the FM, were combined into this name.

is a universe made entirely of balls of helium trapped by a barrier made of a molecule observed to contain carbon and hydrogen, with each one having a different color. These balls are malleable, and are able to be shattered easily but loudly with enough force or a sharp object, releasing the trapped helium and leaving behind a small bit of the barrier. The Oliweverse is estimated to contain about 10 - 11 quintillion of these objects. The Oliweverse is also the largest universe in the FM, being 287.1 trillion ly large.

is the smallest universe of the FM, being only about 0.46 meters large. There is not much to the Sesqudipedaliaverse, with its interior consisting of only stray particles. It was originally thought to be a trirogue

asteroid, until it was more closely investigated and was discovered to be considered its own universe.

is a universe that contains pseudo-universal structures known as Uniaverses. A Uniaverse contains circular disks which hold the inhabitants of the verse, known as Multians, and other planet-like structuring and makeup. The gravity of a disk gets stronger as you get closer to its center, with gravity near the center being comparable to a black hole.
