Rules of the
Ashtal-a'ab
:
Any
matter which is created,
must
be destroyed.
Any
matter which is destroyed,
must
be created.
If rule 2 applies, information of said matter
must
be corrupted.
Information of large sizes
must
be compressed, via random
deletion
.
The 4th dimension isn't a straight line, but an
infinite
Lévy flight
.
Any
information which touches the
Ashtal-a'ab
boundary,
must
be insantly teleported to
another
point on the boundary.
Each
time a particle reaches the velocity limit, the limit gets lowered and the particle gets
destroyed
.
All
motion is
Brownian motion
, no exceptions.
The
Ashtal-a'ab
has gravity
itself
.
