infinite
, like no matter how many indescribable, uncomputable, Innumerable, Inaccessible, unquantifiable, unstoppable layers of layers of layers of true infinity you stack on a true infinite amount of times, it wouldn't even get close to IMMENSUM, not even a fraction

amount of ↑ Knuth up arrows and Factorials, This number which we will be calling J(N) is way beyond
ʍ
so much to the point where the gap between true nothing and the
Haxourealogon
wouldn't even be close to describing the gap, IMMENSUM is J(J(J)) a J amount of times btw
Power: TITD/M+++++++++++++ AD INFINITUM (Truly impossible to describe/measure) times Infinity
Size: not bounded by any measurements
Knowledge: same as size
Goals: Completed
