The Circular Portal is a portal that will teleport you into a alternate place that you have not been in before (possibly) when you touch it. The place being referenced is some sort of "alternate reality greater than reality". It contains all realities within a different reality. This means that the possible places you could be teleported to are greater than any infinity as you will never end up in the same place. this can be proven by the evidence that after you are teleported to a infinite different places you still end up in a different place after your

time inside the portal, this will go the same until you eventually reach the Ωth time going through the portal, as uncountable infinities are well... uncountable, you stop being placed in new areas and a loop starts, placing you back to the place you were in when you started. the loop is the reason the "(possibly)" is added when explaining "that you will be teleported to a place you have not been before".
