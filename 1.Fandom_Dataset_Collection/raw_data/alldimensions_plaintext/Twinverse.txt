A Twinverse is a type of verse, that can be
Universe
,
Megaverse
, and other verses. It is a type of verse where there are two of same type of verses and 99.99999% or more alike would have forces (similar to how universe groups form), but so intense, it would slowly and slowly intersect becoming two verses that combined into one, the
Intersection region
, is always glitchy, no matter what, and the intersection region is often a color mix of the two other verses, it is VERY unlikely, but it could happen that two different verses, such as
Multiverse
, and a
Teraverse
, could become a Twinverse. A region called the
Core
will create twinium, a radioactive material, has a atomic number of 972. and has 1,095 neutrons, and 5-dimensional. It was hard to find out how to use it but in 9182, we found out how to use it.

Technology
[
]
We have found out that its very great for nuclear bombs, 897x better than plutonium. We can also use them for portals, but tricky to handle, you can make a cannon, shooting out twinium, and some complex math.
Twinspheres
[
]
Twinspheres are spheres that contain the twinverses, having cores at the edges to help the glitching from not going TOO crazy. To be classified as a twinverse, it needs to have a twinspheres, its proved that it takes >30 septillion years for the cores to be fully complete, and >20 septillion years to intersect, and its proven that Twinspheres are created when they start to intersect. given that, it takes >50 Septillion years to make a twinverse,
Early formation
[
]
The early formation will create a extra verse, that often starts as 10 LY wide, the density is so high that the verses (or galaxies) are pushing the border and growing to a tenth of their average size (for that verse), however these are not considered as the "smallest verse", as they will grow to their average size.
When the Twinsphere is not complete, and it is a early twinverse, it dosent hold, it has energy to explode, but it weirdly doesn't. We dont have explanation for why, but it just doesn't explode,
Prefixes
[
]
Whole Twinverse of same type
[
]
A twinverse of same type has a prefix of T-, and then whatever type they are, for example it could be something like T-MLTI-992
Twinsphere of the same type
[
]
The twinsphere it self has the same prefix T-, but has a suffix of _, and the type ant numbers of course. So if we talked about the twinsphere of say, T-MLTI-992, we would say T-MLTI-992_
Twinverse excluding Twinsphere of same type
[
]
The twinverse itself has the same prefix, but has a suffix of -. So for example, T-MLTI-992-
Whole Twinverse of different type
[
]
The whole twinverse would have prefix T- and then the biggest verse, and a suffix of -T- and then the smallest verse, so for example, T-MGA-57-T-UNI
Twinsphere of different type
[
]
Its the same as the same type, just with the extra suffix
Twinverse excluding twinsphere of different type
[
]
Its the same as the same type, just with the extra suffix.

Triplets and quadruplets and etc. do also exist, but very rare
