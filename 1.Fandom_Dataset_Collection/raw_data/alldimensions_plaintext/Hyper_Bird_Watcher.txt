NOTE: This is a
page I made in another wiki
, but im sure it fits here.
Hyper Bird Watcher
The Universes Eater
Full model of Hyper Bird Watcher.
Ditto.
The
Hyper Bird Watcher
is a creature made by
Artem Artem Animations
, being a very strong variation of the Bird Watcher. He is one of the many Hyper creatures, the others can be found
here
.
He is also known as "The Universes Eater" and the "God Of Void". For some reason, there's ANOTHER entity named Universes Eater that is NOT Hyper Bird Watcher, but is related. Read about him in the second tabber!
Appearance
[
]
He has a similar appearance to the original Bird Watcher, with some differences like having each one of his eyes in different colors, representing the ones a rainbow has and black skin that can change colour and is constantly glowing.
His size is debatable, since in the
first video
he has ever appeared it is stated that he has a size of 820 megameters (AKA 820 thousand kilometers / 820 million meters), but in
another (and more recent) one
it is stated as infinite. Due to the inconsistency, we'll assume he can change his size at will.
Abilities
[
]
Generation of extremly sharp shard-like structures
that can be used to pierce enemies. They can glow in different colors.
Blasting a very strong rainbow glowing ray
.
"Super'ifying" other creatures
, enhancing their size, strenght and abilities massively.
"Hyper'ifying" other creatures
, similar to the former ability but on a higher scale. This also makes them have a similar color scheme to him.
Stated
Immortality
.
Ironically, this has been
ignored
multiple
times
, so rather than immortality Hyper Bird Watcher could have the revival ability instead.
Spike summon
.
String summon
.
Spear summon
.
Energy blasts
.
The Universes Eater's first form.
!WARNING! The Universes Eater is NOT Hyper Bird Watcher. They're separate entities,
Hyper Bird Watcher being only a creation of the Universes Eater
(read linked comment).
The Universes Eater
is yet another very strong Bird Watcher variant who has also been made by
Artem Artem Animations
, being far above Hyper Bird Watcher. In fact, he's so strong he surpasses
fiction
!
Appareance
[
]
Phase 1
[
]
The Universes Eater is pretty similar to the Hyper Bird Watcher, but having his legs replaced by a tail with a pitchfork-like end, his head tendrils are now rainbow-colored and his back has grown colorful spikes.
His power level is also stated to be much higher than Hyper Bird Watcher's
, in fact being an entity above fiction.
Phase 2
, "The Multiverses Eater"
[
]
Similar as the previous one, but with a scar on his body, his back spikes being distorted and having spikes on his head,
which dissapear a few seconds later after transforming, for some reason
.
Phase 3
, "The Fandoms Eater / Last Error"
[
]
Similar as the previous one, but with his eyes, head tendrils and spikes now only being yellow, cyan, green, white, black and red, the scar on his body being bigger, his pitchfork-like end of the tail being white and blue and his entire body is now covered in glitches.
Phase 4
, "The Forgotten Void"
[
]
Similar as the previous one, but with black & white color scheme.
Phase 5
, "The End"
[
]
Similar as the previous one, but with his entire body melting.

Trivia
[
]
Fake Hyper Bird Watcher's appareance.
A "fake" version of Hyper Bird Watcher exists
, sporting a way simpler appareance, less eyes and no glow. Ironically, it is also stated as the weakest Bird Watcher variation in the Artem Artem's universe, being the complete opposite of the real one.
Universes Eater seems to hate fake Hyper Bird Watcher,
killing him once
. This could be because of him basically being designed to make fun of his creation, the real Hyper Bird Watcher.
Universes Eater and Hyper Bird Watcher have never interacted directly in any of Artem Artem's videos, yet there's a high chance they do interact with eachother offscreen.
There's a decent chance Hyper Bird Watcher and The Universes Eater were once the same being, or that the "original" Hyper evolved into Eater, and created a clone of his former self, this being the current one we see in the videos, meaning there's 2 Hyper Bird Watchers at the same time.
