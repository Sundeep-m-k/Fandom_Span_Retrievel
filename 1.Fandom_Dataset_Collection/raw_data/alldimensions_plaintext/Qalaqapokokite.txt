Overview
[
]
Qalaqapokokite is the strongest material in existence. The material is so strong it was used to cover
ALL
, the quintessence of everything that has ever been, is, and will be. It is very moldable and changeable, but totally unbreakable. Nothing can pierce through this material, not even the strongest of tools, weapons, or astronomical phenomena in ALL
Formation
[
]
Qalaqapokokite is formed through one event only. The death of
FÃ«llxverses
. The spectacular death of these verses are similar to that of red giant stars. Much like those stars, these verses will expand then accelerate inwards on itself and explode. The explosion is then so great, it condenses into this material.
Origins

]
Qalaqapokokite can only be found at the edge of everything. Aside from observing it from afar, it is so far out, no one knows what it truly looks like, what it feels like, how heavy it is, etc, and we will never know anything about it beyond this.
