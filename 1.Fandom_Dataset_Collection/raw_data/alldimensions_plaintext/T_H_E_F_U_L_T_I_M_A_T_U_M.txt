Contains
The looker

The Qultimatum
The Fultimatum, or
T H E  F U L T I M A T U M
is the 5th step on the
Ultimatum's chain
. Unlike the other ones, it has an appeareance of an giant sea, were its the place that contains the 'verses, lesser Ultimatums, etc.
The one huge eye who floats is
The looker
, the "moon" of the Fultimatum. You can learn more about it in its article (Not made yet).
Temperature? Random, like always.
It also has an updraged version of the toxic substances of
The Qultimatum
. It has red colors, and it also moves, but its even deadlier.
Also, in the areas where the toxic substance is in the moment, the temperature is higher.
