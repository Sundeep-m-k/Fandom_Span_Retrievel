Tips

The omni-bat is fast and hard to hit, but it isn’t very deadly so you can wait for it to attack and then, since its’s close to you, kill it.
If an object is available, you can teleport behind it. It may or may not fly behind the object at some point, if if it does you can just teleport out.
If the Omni-Surface is close, Omni-Bats tend to stay away. That is good because you can rest there and not have to worry about omni-bats.
Omni-
force fields are  very effective against Omni-Bats, as it is pretty much impossible for them to break through.
