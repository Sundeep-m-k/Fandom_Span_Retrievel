This is vltra's surpasser and to explain this I have to make something called the cake index which is just super loops on sarpy particles:
CI(cake index)
Totum
: -1 CI
Treneversei: 0 CI
Vltra: 1 CI
The Cake of Cakes: 2 CI
alright now that's cleared up it's time to world build:
The Cake of Cakes (and like anything above it) was created by The Transcendental Praetergods(which surpass Praetergods and makes them look like micro peanut 1% power) and also jerald(because yes) these structures which we now are gonna Call "Cake-Level Structures" because it's gonna be that now because it's accurate to the cake index
Things this thing contains:
Vltra(lol)
