What about the Red Ring and higher verses?
[
]
Simply put, they do not exist. The Blue Ring is the largest verse known to the
All Dimensions Wiki
, and nothing contains it. "Verses" such as the
Red Ring
are either propagated by groups such as the
Red Ring Cult
in order to mislead the general public or simply works of fiction. The BRF condemns any ideology which believes in or otherwise supports these verses.
