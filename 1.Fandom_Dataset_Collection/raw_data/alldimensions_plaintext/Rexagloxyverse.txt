Introduction
[
]
The
Rexagloxyverse
, also nicknamed "
Rexa
" is a
verse
with a spectacular design due to its shades. Let's just get straight to the point though, as that's not even close to being its current main feature, its new purpose:
Story
[
]
Deletion
[
]
You see, this verse
was once erased from existence on september 19th, 2020
, as it was deemed as 'low effort'. This happened since it had next to no content on its page, along with a certainly mediocre grammar.
But, one aspect about this world stood out, which wasn't discarded unlike the others: its appearance. Those spectacular shades were so fascinating,
they were reutilized in february 6th, 2021
for another verses: the
Alphasms
.
Thus, all the legacy of the Rexagloxyverse was reduced to being the source of the appearance used for another verse. Everything else was gone, turned into nothing.
Revival
[
]
That was until july 18th, 2025, the day of its revival, by the hands of the user Idontknow350. That same day, Rexa was granted sentience, as it was forced to learn about what had happened during all those years it was gone, and realizing how it had lost all its meaning thanks to the Alphasms. No one remembered the source, only the ones who had taken over it.
It is said that there's nothing more dangerous than a man who has lost everything. But what about a WHOLE UNIVERSE stumbling upon said tragedy? Being forgotten, nullified, and now changed?
It didn't take long before the Rexagloxyverse knew what its new purpose in this world would be. As a twisted form of retribution, it now would hunt down any Alphasm it could find, though even that wasn't enough for it.
Instead, after destroying said entities, Rexa would then absorb the minds of the slaughtered Alphasms, forcing them to be stuck in an eternal loop of decayment, where their souls would slowly shatter, and lose all of their purpose, like the one the Rexagloxyverse had originally lost all those years ago.
Fate of the Rexaicans
[
]
Not even the civilization within it, the Rexaicans, were safe from the rage of their own world. What once was the union bethween both was twisted into a hivemind, with each Rexaican being turned into nothing more than the deepest reflections of hate and loss of their own world, and a tool to reduce any Alphasm's conscioussness to a pointless husk.
They truly lost everything, including their original purpose. What once was a mindless world, turned into a mindless killing machine, an undead beast blinded by the parasite of hate, and the incarnation of one of the most vile forms of "retribution" you might think of. It truly was fighting an already lost war, and losing itself in the way.
Abilities
[
]
Soul absorption
[
]
When the Rexagloxyverse eliminates a sentient target, it can absorb said conscioussness and doom it to an endless cycle where said soul eventually turns into a husk of their former self.
Parasitic hate
[
]
Rexa's sheer prescence in a
Betasm
or similar slowly corrupts the latters. They can't even use their conscioussness in order to get rid of it, so the Rexagloxyverse is pretty much a parasite for these larger worlds.
