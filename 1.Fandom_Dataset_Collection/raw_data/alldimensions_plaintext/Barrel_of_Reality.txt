The Barrel of Reality is the next -verse of Reality after the
Omniverse of Reality
. It contains exactly ω
Omniverses of Reality
, though this number pales in comparison to the size of The Barrel of Reality in
Omniverses of Reality
.The Barrel of Reality itself is not shaped like a fractal. It is contained by the
Box of Reality
, the next -verse of Reality. Our
Omniverse of Reality
is contained by a
Nested Infinity
, not a Barrel of Reality.
The Barrel Fractal
[
]
The
Omniverses of Reality
are contained within a large purple-reddish colored barrel-like fractal known as The Barrel Fractal, pictured in the photo provided. This fractal is ω
Barrel
Omniverses of Reality
large. The only thing able to be contained directly by The Barrel Fractal are
Omniverses of Reality
; anything directly contained by The Barrel Fractal which is not an
Omniverse of Reality
gets deleted. Therefore, the only way to escape The Barrel Fractal is to teleport from an
Omniverse of Reality
into the space beyond the fractal.
It is not known what it looks like within the The Barrel Fractal, though
Gerald
claims it is a colorful space with
Omniverses of Reality
interspersed throughout. The color of the inside is claimed by Gerald to be the same as the color of the outside of the Barrel Fractal.
Other verses
[
]
Outside of The Barrel Fractal, there are many verses, most of them finite-sized, contained by the Barrel of Reality. They usually are in large 'filaments' and clusters, though there are some isolated ones as well. Rogue
Omniverses of Reality
can also be found.
There are also verse-creating 'nebulae' which create verses at a high rate, at about Ω verses per
voidsecond
. Therefore, at least Ω
2
verses are being created every second from a single nebula. However, these nebulas are very rare, with there only being a total of about 2ω+1281 nebulae in the nearest Barrel of Reality to us. The biggest nebula in the nearest Barrel of Reality to us is about 5
Universes of Reality
big, and the smallest is as about big as a
Barrelplazia
.
They are created when The Barrel Fractal has a chunk broken off of it by any means.
