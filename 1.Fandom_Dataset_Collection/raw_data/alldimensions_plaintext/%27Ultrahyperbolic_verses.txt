This is a category of verses that have higher "constants" than our own, and are often far more dynamic and chaotic than our
Universe
, because the laws that make up these kinds of verses allow certain impossible things to happen in them. The requirements for verses to be classed as ultrahyperbolic are: 3+ spacial dimensions, at least 1,000,000 unique subatomic particle types (as opposed to 17 from the Standard Model), at least 20 unique natural stable states of matter, at least 200 different elements in their periodic table, 10+ forces that govern the verse (opposed to 4 in ours), a spacial hyperbolic geometry of 540+ degrees, and a multitude of other requirements.

Often times, these kinds of verses are MANY times larger than ours, (only those that meet a certain size requirement will be classed as ultrahyperbolic), and they can be some of the largest verses that exist in the
Omniverse
. The higher the dimensionality and overall "hyperbolicness" of the verse, the rarer it occurs in the
Omniverse
.

On planets with life, there exist at least tens of billions of species, but that is the lower limit. Some planets have been observed to possess over a
multillion
species in some of the higher level verses.
