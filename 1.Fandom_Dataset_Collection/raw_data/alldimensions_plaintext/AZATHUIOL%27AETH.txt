Azathuiol'aeth! The Unspeakable! 2 months ago the lord of darkness was walking in
flower fields
until he found a spider looking thing just trying to eat the flower in the most stupid way possible, lord of darkness thought to himself "hell yeah" and then just grabbed the spider like you would grab your cat, took it home, lord of darkness showed it to lord of light, it goes like this:
LOD: yo bro check out what I got
LOL:  tf is that
LOD: dunno, found it near our local hyperflowers, this werid cat spider was face planting into the flowers like a toddler eating dino chicken nuggets
LOL: why was it doing that, infact who tf put it there
LOD: idk but I'm gonna give it spicy chicken dipped in spice and sauce and salt,
gives the azathuiol'aeth the chicken
