Actually existing things smaller than it
The Unifield is a cosmological structure that contains smaller things that actually exist, though it cannot contain imaginary things, for instance an imaginary ball. The
Binaryfield
will do that. The reason is that you are only imagining that ball and it actually doesn't exist. The Unifield can only contain things that follow 2 criteria:
It is smaller than the Unifield.
It actually exists and is not imaginary or made up.
That ball doesn't follow the 2nd criteria, "It actually exists and is not imaginary or made up", so it cannot be contained by Unifield. A nonexistent object smaller than Unifield that tries to enter Unifield will automatically be warped back to Binaryfield as if a nonexistent object enters it, it's spacetime will glitch and time will locally rewind on that object.
