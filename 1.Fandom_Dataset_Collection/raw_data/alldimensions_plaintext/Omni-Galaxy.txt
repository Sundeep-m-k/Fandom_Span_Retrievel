Types of life
[
]
There are multiple types of life in the Omni-Galaxy, such as
Omni-Humans
, and other races of
Omni-Aliens
like the
Omni-Knuberis
and the
Omni-Larjins
.  However, there are also
Omni-Stars
, which actually have life and can breathe and speak.  The
Omni-Stars
Are the main reason of heat in our local
Omni-Surface
.
Multiple
Omni-Abstracts
?
[
]
Yes, there are multiple
Omni-Aliens
That each represent all abstract things.  The way this is possible is because of alternate versions and definitions of "abstract".  For example, time might not be abstract in another
Omni-Alien
's home
Omni-Surface
.
The Omni-Blackhole
[
]
The Omni-Blackhole
is like the blackhole in the middle of normal galaxies, but in this case it's depicted as a destroyer of concepts and ideas.  It's arguably one of the biggest threats in the
Omni-Universe
.
