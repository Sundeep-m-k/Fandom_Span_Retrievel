this is a page existing to document specific
Post-Loop Verses
. since not all of these ideas can quickly be expanded upon to take up multiple pages, and the compounding facts that
i
cannot make that many pages within a reasonable amount of time, and that i am eager to create
something
for these, i have decided to make this page.

96
[
]
Nothing is known about 96. Any and all attempts to document 96 outside of the following information has resulted in it going missing completely. Along with that, there is no one you can ask anything else about 96 to, because they will have forgotten everything about it. It has only been observed twice, and that was from 116 and 115 respectively. However, it cannot be shown because we obviously lost the pics.
131

PLSI 131 is a large, seemingly empty void containing only one verse, basically just containing everything smaller than it. The void in question is significantly larger than what very little is in it, so as you can imagine, it's quite a large, empty space. outside of reaching insane speeds, there is no known way to leave 131 from inside, except for travelling extremely fast and flying through. However, no such propulsion method that can be built with available resources inside of this zone is known to be possible. As such, there have only been 4,119 attempts to exit. Such tries have been shown to invariably fail, and as such, all further attempts have been discontinued until anything promising is discovered. All information further does not exist from first hand experience of actually being in such verse, except for rare exception, such as some bored god giving the observer a tour. Somehow this has happened more than once. We still don't know why, but it did.

This is literally the exact opposite of 131, being similar to
Virvis
. This is even harder to get through from the inside than 131, because you can't just keep flying. Reason why being your stupid fucking ship just got obliterated by the randomness of space now irrelevant.
145

Enermous galaxies, possibly post-looped. Beyond looped structures. Once trillions, now 400M largest galaxies. Same mass, fewer galaxies.
145 is a collection of abnormally large galaxies. They appear to be post-looped loop galaxies, however this verse is beyond loops. Basically it is now just believed to be a massive cluster of really large verses that look like spiral galaxies. There are 400,000,000 of these galaxies, but there used to be trillions. The remaining galaxies were the largest, and have since apparently only gotten bigger, so there is still the same amount of mass in the galaxies, just distributed through fewer galaxies.

We were not supposed to look out this far. This was a great mistake. The truth has been discovered. Hope is lost.
