The Senseverse is a large "creature" composed of 7 smaller verses/components. These 7 verses can turn the Senseverse into a sentient entity, and are responsible for providing the Senseverse entity with important abilities/senses, such as sight, hearing, movement, and higher-level thinking.
The Senseverse is not usually sentient, although it has occasionally achieved small bursts of sentience, in which it always violently destroyed countless verses before the 7 verses making it up were pulled apart from each other. These verses connect with each other in many different ways to form a sentient structure.
The verses have a tendency to move towards each other if separated and connect again, letting the Senseverse become a sentient entity. As the Senseverse entity has been very destructive in all the times the Senseverse achieved sentience, the 7 verses are rountinely separated and are all encased in a very tough material which prevents them from connecting together.
There have been a few times when the 7 verses which make up the Senseverse have displayed signs of sentience as well, such as when the verse responsible for letting the Senseverse entity see tried to escape the place where it was kept, and killed 3 cosmic entities before it could be restrained.
The creation of the Senseverse has been attributed to the leader of
The Utilitary
, Lgvigfe. It is unknown why Lgvigfe decided to create the Senseverse.
