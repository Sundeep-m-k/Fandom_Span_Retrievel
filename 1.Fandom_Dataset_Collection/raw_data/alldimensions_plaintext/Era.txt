"Era"
(aka
DLT-0.991-v2 ww002 [DD01] Omega

Hypermassive Neutron Star:
A ginormous neutron star with it's surface gravity being 5.6 * 10
15
G (approx 5.6 quadrillion times stronger than gravity of the Earth). It's diameter is 15 AU. It is not yet confirmed to be a neutron star, as it is too massive to be one.
Blue Giant
1:
A 230 million years old star.
Blue Giant 2:
Indifferent.
White Giant:
A star ten times more massive than our Sun.
Yellow Supergiant:
Set to explode in under 10 million years.
Red Hypergiant:
Largest object of the system. However, thousand times less massive than the core object.
7 Main sequence stars:
Red, Red, Yellow, White, Blue, Navy, Red.
4 Unregistered stars:
[Unknown]
Miscellanous information

Core neutron star of the system is about 56% of the mass of the entire system.
Core neutron star's luminosity is insane. Seen from a distance of 50 light years, it would appear as bright as the Sun to Earth.
The hypermassive neutron star's core environment is unknown, but physical laws are theorised to break down there.
