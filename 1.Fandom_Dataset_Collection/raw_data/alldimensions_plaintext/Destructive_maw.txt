Introduction
[
]
The
Destructive maws
, with the company of a lot of
Bloody eyes
make
Painful worlds
. These holes with teeth work like black holes, absorbing almost everything. Bloody eyes and Destructive maws can be highly dangerous when combined, of course. Some think that in this place we can hear screams of the victims of the maw, but its just a theory. Nonetheless, the danger of this place is non-debatable.
Like in the Bloody Eyes, this place is used as a cosmic execution machine.
Can these be considered real black holes?

Here's a quick way to say the answer: Is it normal that entities have literal black holes as mouths? No its not. They arent black holes.
