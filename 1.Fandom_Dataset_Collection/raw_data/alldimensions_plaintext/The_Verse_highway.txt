25 lightyears width, and the length is too high to be measured.
(author's note: please add more classes to this)
The verse highway is a superstructure allowing for quick and safe travel across the hierarchy  of verses.
It begins at the
Omniverse
, and continues for a long amount of verses.
It even has many mechanisms to help escape certain verses, in order to make entities able to access higher parts of the hierarchy.
Class 1
[
]
This section's entrance is a portal 10 billon light years wide in the omniverse, which leads to many interconnected highways on the surface of The
Barrel
. This web of highways eventually leads a sort of hub in the center of the barrel container, which is a verse with a high amount of trade, and advanced technology. This hub has separate parts of the highway, leading to many other barrels, and verses such as
Rainbowcosmos
, and
Electrocosmos
. This web of highways across the entire
Barrel Container
, and the many barrels within. The exit is in the middle of the Hub, being a portal which has two options: changing your
Existence Rank
to -1 and teleporting you to
The Other Box
, or changing your existence rank to 3 and teleporting you to another hub, in Class 2.
Esoteric Class.

Class 2
[
]
These networks span the
Cetaverse
, and contain class-1 and Esoteric Class-1 networks. These Highways go to other boxes in the cetaverse, with the end of the highways at the surface of the boxes containing a portal to another class-1 hub.
