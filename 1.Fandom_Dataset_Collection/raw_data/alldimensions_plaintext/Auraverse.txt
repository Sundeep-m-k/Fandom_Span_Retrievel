Introduction
[
]
An Auraverse is a verse where aura is present. Aura is a aurora like thing that normally goes through the verse with light speed, but when it finds a being it goes inside it and makes it stronger. Therefore many creatures reside in the auraverse. Transinfinite pipes also drain auraverses of their aura, but it never runs out.
