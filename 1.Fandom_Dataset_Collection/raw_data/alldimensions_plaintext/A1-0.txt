Background
[
]
A1-0 is an extremely large, dynamic, infohazardous idea and spacial complex. It is an
estimated 3 trillion times the size of the
Omniverse
approximately R-value size, and is estimated to be at least 10 quadrillion years old. A1-0 was first discovered by human civilization in 6427, making it the first
Black Box
to be identified in human history. A1-0 was discovered when researchers discovered the existence of several, large, completely empty voids now known as
Voidspheres
within the Omniverse. These Voidspheres were a direct result of A1-0's influence moving towards the Omniverse and intersecting with it. It is unknown what exactly caused this event to occur, but A1-0 had reversed in direction, and these Voidspheres dissipated.
Researchers within the organization of Our Orange Light were thought to have analyzed these temporary Voidspheres while they had existed. After forming several predictions of the cause of the event, the researchers discovered the true cause and were destroyed by A1-0's infohazardous properties. During their last known documented events, these researchers appeared to be succumbing to a sort of mind-affecting agent, possibly as a result of A1-0. The groups then disappeared and are presumed neutralized, leaving several 10 km void spaces that are assumed to be the only remnants of the organization.
A1-0 was rediscovered by our organization after the completion of test chambers in Project BETA, which was originally dedicated to the containment of a larger
Black Box
entity
, allowing far more direct observation of all weaker Black Box entities and slightly more specific observation of stronger Black Box entities. Our current studies show that A1-0 is currently moving away from the Omniverse, but is nevertheless consuming our information and physical space. Fortunately, the rate at which information is consumed is very slow, at roughly 23 quadrillion BPSY within the Omniverse.
A1-0 appears to be consuming smaller Black Boxes at a rapid rate.
Idea Complex
[
]
A1-0 is an extremely powerful idea complex, able to easily destroy all concepts within an individuals mind and replace it with its own. This does not kill the subject, but restricts its cognitive abilities to being unable to comprehend anything that is not related to its concepts. It will then spread the core concepts, resulting in anyone comprehending the information dying or having their concepts also replaced.
A1-0 is extremely powerful, recent research into its inner workings via powerful computer-driven systems show that it is able to instantaneously wipe out any sentient organism with a IMRV of less than the U value. The exact value of U remains unknown, ho. However, it has been proven to be far larger than defined numbers (including Aleph, Inaccessible, Mahlo, Weakly Compact K, I3/I2/I1/I0, Reinhardt...) within 2 ↑↑ 2,000 symbols in the generalized human extendable range of mathematics. This includes ZFC, First Order Set Theory, ATR
0
, and all other human driven conceptual mathematics. By the human extendable range of mathematics, we are referring to all mathematical theorems that have ever been conceptualized by humans. This human range is far weaker than the A1-0 conceptual complex range, as A1-0 had attacked other Black Box systems. It then formed an extremely strong logical system, resulting in it dominating in clashes between other Black Boxes. It has been proven that the U value is the cause for many other attributes of A1-0, including its size.
The average IMRV value of a person is 19.2. The average IMRV value of a toddler is 18.5, the same as most chimps. The IMRV value of a dog is 18.2, cats with 17.6. The highest documented value of a biological IMRV was an IMRV from an elephant, scoring 21.7 on the scale. The scale is logarithmic, making that elephant nearly 20x more resistant than the average person to memetic cognitohazards. The best AI showed a maximum of 79.4. The lowest score was from a jellyfish, 0.
R-value
[
]
R-value is an infinite cardinal concept defined in the formal mathematical non-paradoxical language L, within A1-0. It determines several attributes, including A1-0's size. The exact definition of the cardinal remains unclear, as this is the only known information recovered on the existence of this R value.

A1-0, is an extremely powerful complex, as it is able to easily influence any entity with IMRV of less than the U value. It appears that the formal theory/language T that U may be based in is far more powerful than any observed mathematical language ever observed. This is due to the extremely large size of A1-0, allowing it to store extremely complex cosmic ideas. In addition, it has been proven that the R-value is growing
extremely
rapidly, meaning that A1-0 is growing in size at a huge rate. It is estimated to supersede
Hazosphere
within 47 years, and escape
The Box
within 53 years.
Notably, A1-0 is extremely far (known as D value or distance value) away from our Omniverse, and receding away at an extremely fast rate. For the remaining 53 years, the D value should be larger than R value.
