The Cosmite species is a threat to all of the
Zeberverse
. When
RapsterZeber
first made the Zeberverse.
History
[
]
At first there was just one Cosmite. It was about twice the size of a newborn worm. But it gained the complete size of everything it ate.
After a few hours the first Cosmite ate the planet it was born into existence on. With that, a new Cosmite appeared on another planet elsewhere in the Zeberverse.
Sextilions of years later, 10% of the Zeberverse was destroyed by the Cosmites. And with the speed that they where growing at, it would only be a merge quadrillion more years before the Zeberverse was destroyed. Not much time for RapsterZeber to think of a plan.
99% of the Zeberverse was destroyed by the Cosmites when RapsterZeber finally finished making a spell. Then, after millions of years of saying the incantations, when only 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of the Zeberverse remained, it was done. A giant burst of energy came out of RapsterZeber's body, killing every Cosmite. Now it was a matter of making more planets.
Septillions of years later, the effects of the Cosmites was done. But with the Zeberverse having been restored, on another planet, another Cosmite was born.
Abilities
[
]
A Cosmite posses a few abilities that make it unique. It's a purple worm-like creature that is very flexible. It is immune to everything other than spells that take millions of years to cast, if not more.
The Cosmite can still starve to death however. Every year, the Cosmite shrinks by 2 centimeters. If the Cosmite was less than 2.5 cm large, it would be dead.
The Cosmite at first will eat as fast as a worm, but gain the exact size of whatever it eats. After it has grown large enough to consume kilometer-tall skyscrapers in a single bite, it can open it's mouth and make giant chomps onto what it is currently eating.
The Cosmite has a sense of where every space object is, so it will only move on to another location after every last atom in that area has been completely destroyed. After which, a brand new Cosmite will be born on a random planet somewhere in the Zeberverse.
