A
tesseract
is a 4-dimensional hypercube. Since the
number
of dimensions is a square number, the diagonal length of a tesseract is an integer - in this case, 2. Its Bowers acronym is "tes". The image shows the shadow of a rotating tesseract, keep in mind that 4D objects have 3D shadows.

The tesseract can be seen as a
cube
prism
, the product of a cube and a
line segment
. It is also the
square
-square duoprism, i.e. the product of two squares. It can also be seen as a square prism prism, or the product of four line segments.
Structure and sections
[
]
The tesseract is composed of eight cubic cells. Two of these cubes line in parallel 3-D spaces, while the remaining six connect the faces of the cubes. Four
cubes
meet at each vertex.
In cube-first position, it is a sequence of identical cubes. In square-centered orientation, it is a square which expands to a
square prism
and back. When seen line-first it is a line that expands to a
triangular prism
, then turns to a
hexagonal prism
, and then back. Finally in corner first orientation, it goes through the entire tetrahedral truncation series, from point to
tetrahedron
to
octahedron
in the middle and then back.
Uses
[
]
A Tesseract can only be used to make a Tesseract scepter, which functions as a magic harry-potter wand basically. It is traditionally used in the crowning of monarchs.
