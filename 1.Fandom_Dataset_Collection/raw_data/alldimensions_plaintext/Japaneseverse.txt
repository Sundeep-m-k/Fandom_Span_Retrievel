What the heck is this
Hi, welcome to AD. I have made a new verse, it's a big thing. This verse is a million light years wide, and it is called the Japaneseverse. It floats somewhere in
The Box
, but it absolutely
destroys
the Pearlharbourverse.

This verse was originally created by someone called
Not scoot
in March 2019 while trying to describe what AD was like, stating the following:
I think having a lower quality place like Beyond Universe is a really good thing. I mean I love V&D but people options shouldn't be either "hi welcome to V&D here's a 200 page book on set theory and maybe another one on hypercomplex numbers, also you best read the entire Googology Wiki and possibly every principle of ancient philosophical ideas, not to mention the entirety of quantum physics and of course every single word ever publushed by or in relation to Georg Cantor, of course that goes without saying. Once you've done all that pledge your allegiance to this giant cube and
maybe
you'll be allowed to comment." or "HAI WELCUM TO AD I HAV MAD A NEW VERSE ITS A BIG THING A MILLION LITE YEARS WIYD ITS CALLED THE JAPANESEVERSE AND IT DESTROYS THE PEARLHARBOURVERSE!!!!!!111!1!!!1!11!ONE!!2!!1!" Habing a middle ground like Beyond Universe makes sense.
As you can tell, there are some spelling and grammar errors in this passage, but it does mention the Japaneseverse and that it destroys the Pearlharbourverse.
How it destroys the Pearlharbourverse
[
]
It destroys the Pearlharbourverse because it is much bigger and more massive. It has a type of substance that is exactly opposite of the main substance that the Pearlharbourverse is made of, and it also has its own gravity so it can attract the Pearlharbourverse near it. The Pearlharbourverse is also the only thing that is close to it. Because of this, every time the Pearlharbourverse touches the Japaneseverse, the Pearlharbourverse is slightly damaged. The Pearlharbourverse is now completely destroyed because of the Japaneseverse, since the Japaneseverse has damaged the Pearlharbourverse a grand total of 164,032 times.
Why it is the Japaneseverse
[
]
It is the Japaneseverse because that is the name that Not scoot assigned it when creating it. The fact that it destroys the Pearlharbourverse is a reference to the fact that Japan bombed Pearl Harbour in 1941.
The connection to V&D
[
]
The Japaneseverse was originally produced in a very large
laboratory
, and going to the laboratory makes you hear the following passage:
"hi welcome to V&D here's a 200 page book on set theory and maybe another one on hypercomplex numbers, also you best read the entire Googology Wiki and possibly every principle of ancient philosophical ideas, not to mention the entirety of quantum physics and of course every single word ever publushed by or in relation to Georg Cantor, of course that goes without saying. Once you've done all that pledge your allegiance to this giant cube and maybe you'll be allowed to comment."
The word "published" is mispronounced for unknown reasons, but this may be because it was created to prove why habing a middle ground like Beyond Universe makes sense.
