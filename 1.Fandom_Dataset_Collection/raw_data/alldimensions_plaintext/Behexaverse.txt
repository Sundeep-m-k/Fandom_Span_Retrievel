Location
[
]
The Behexaverse can be easily located in the Begahault supercluster, a supercluster that contains   ∩^3  Berverses. The Behexaverse can be spotted easily due to its size dwarfing all Bereverses around it. The Light in the core comes from constant collision of galaxies with in it.
Creation
[
]
The Behexaverses creation remains unknown, but serval theories exist one of the most popular the theory suggest that 2 supermassive Berverses collided causing a supermassive Berverse, which was discolored for reasons unknown to us. (This would later be proven true by various observations by Stellar-View)
Civilizations
[
]
There currently a φ (Incalculable) amount of civilizations due to the Behexaverse having 10^23 Bluetaverses in the Behexaverse. Humans cannot communicate with the civilizations due to distance.
Observations
[
]
Stellar-view examined the Behexaverse in 3042 and discovered that two supermassive Berverses collided causing the formation of the Behexaverse.
