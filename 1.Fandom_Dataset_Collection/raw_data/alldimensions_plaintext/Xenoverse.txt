About
[
]
A
Xenoverse
is the second to last official type of
Archverse
, residing before the
Hyperverses
. They contain
Metaverses
which have slight variations in their logical systems. Also, some Xenoverses directly contain
Universes
too.
Matter information
[
]
Xenoverses also are primitive networks of matter information, which can be primarily accessible via
Omni-Webs
.
As a collection of Metaverses, Xenoverses have distinct laws / logics to all Metaverses for matter sustainability. Waves are seemed outside of Metaverses, but dangerous as it possesses entities with information overlapping.
Spatial manipulation
[
]
Metaverses can appear and disappear from existence anytime, and have their own regions throughout a Xenoverse.
Structure
[
]
The structure of a Xenoverse is composed of foldable spirals of Metaverses (known as Metaverse clusters), arranged in size. The clusters are also foldable, and can have a mix of
existence ranks
of existence and non-existence with their own regions. Smaller Metaverses, however, can't fluidly switch between existence ranks. Matter information seems to not exist in a Xenoverse.
Overlap
[
]
Due to high dimensionality, spirals are seemed overlapping from each other, allowing for easy transportation. At the center, you could find the smallest Metaverses, and more reliable. Even on the surface, there are a collection of spirals.
All Metaverses in Xenoverses seem to be parallel of distinct laws, creating similar regions throughout Metaverses and creating the identical folds during the formation.
Irregular clusters
[
]
Some Metaverse clusters are cluttered in a irregular pentagonal / dodecahedral tiling, usually found midway in a Xenoverse, for size sustainability.

Formation

Depicted Xenoverse formation
Chaos particles
[
]
When a Hyperverse forms, its interior is rife with chaos, and as such, may produce chaos
particles
, which move around at relatively slow speeds. When two particles collide, one will simply invert its direction, but the other will be disproportionately launched in the opposite direction it came from.
Proto-Xenoverses
[
]
Inevitably, this speeding particle will impact the surface of the Hyperverse, fast enough to break out, and cause a 6 dimensional
existence-0
cross section will begin to form and travel in the opposite direction, always expanding as to rest on the surface of the Hyperverse. This is called a Proto-Xenoverse, and after certain large size, it will disconnect from the Hyperverse, turning into an existence-1 Xenoverse and capturing some of the chaos for itself to be used for Metaverses.
Metastrings
[
]
Also
Metastrings
exist here, a meta counterpart of
strings
from the string theory, except for that they are artificial.
Post-formation
[
]
Xenoverses are initially "dualisted", which uses information from 2 Metaverses in a 2 Array Metaverse. As the time goes on, Xenoverses seem to have web-like information gathered from the Omni-Web. It has been sealed by then, due to reliable methods of closing the gateways by a civilization.
Misc. information
[
]
Xenoverses are very useful for keeping fragile things from breaking, used in the
Frickckckckcckkckkcckckckckckverse
and the
Glassverses
.
