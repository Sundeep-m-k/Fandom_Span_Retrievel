The Chargeverse is a verse that needs to be supplied with a constant energy source. If it is not supplied enough energy, the core at its center will power down, essentially bringing the verse straight into heat death and then violently blowing up, which could destroy countless verses.
The Chargeverse needs to be supplied with at least

watts of energy. 3 very large machines are hooked up to the Chargeverse which supply energy to the core of the Chargeverse, the thing which keeps it from going into heat death.
A few creatures have just suggested that the entities running The Purposeverses should just let the Chargeverse blow up, as there has been no proof that the explosion the Chargeverse will cause is going to be a large one. One time, all the entities almost got convinced, and hooked off one of the machines providing power to the Chargeverse before one decided to put it back on again due to fear of being obliterated by the explosion.
Appearance
[
]
The Chargeverse usually just appears as a normal, spherical verse. However, if you look at it from very specific angles, it will appear to be a large mess of polygons and colors. This is due to how light reflects at certain areas on the Chargeverse's barrier, allowing this to happen.
Other Info

As the Chargeverse has no real purpose, it can safely stay inside the

. Also, the dominant life hereâ€™s religion causes them to think apples are sacred, resulting in stealing apples from Earth to protect them. The life here are also at a nigh-subomnipotent level.
