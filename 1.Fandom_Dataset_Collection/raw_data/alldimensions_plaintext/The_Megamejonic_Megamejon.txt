The
Megamejonic Megamejon
is a verse that is shaped like an extremely complex polymejon (1,000,001D shape), and is sometimes called a 'hyperspike' from how many intersecting lines it has. It has two main parts: edges and vertices, and the solid objects. This makes it similar to a combination of
Pentatopic Duetriacontaterons
and
Icosadakonic Meicosahendons
, with the first only having edges and vertices, and the other only having the objects.
Properties
[
]
Because of The Megamejonic Megamejon having both edges and vertices, and solid objects, means that the properties of both The Pentatopic Duetriacontateron and The Icosadakonic Meicosahendon are combined to create The Megamejonic Megamejon.
