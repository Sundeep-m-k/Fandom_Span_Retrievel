The
Cranberrycupverse
is a gigantic cup-shaped verse that holds
Cranberryverses
, about 92 of them. These Cranberryverses, known as "alternate Cranberryverses", are very similar to the Cranberryverse we are familiar with, there being about no differences, with any actual differences being very minor.
However, the verses contained within these Cranberryverses vary widely. Cranberryverses can contain one single verse, like our Cranberryverse, multiple verses, or no verse at all.
Though, when verses do show, they bear many similarities to our Cranberryverses; that is, they are very small, being no more than a gigameter

, are composed of
Paveverses
and
Roadsignverses
, can hold larger verses than its size should theoretically allow for (reasoning and method varies widely between verses, even in the same Cranberryverse), are used in some way by the inhabitants of its local Cranberryverse, and have many verses contained within them (including the Paveverses and Roadsignverses).

Cranberryverse numbering
[
]
There are three distinct systems for Cranberryverse numbering: The ⅋µitǣ CBV-n system, the Cranberryverse-x system, and the Ɱtƭiƍ Cran~x system. ⅋µitǣ's system is more popular to use in both casual and professional contexts, with the other two seeing very rare use and discussion.
CBV-n
[
]
The CBV-n system was first created by amateur versologist ⅋µitǣ.Ɏaʉiȸ when it first discovered the Cranberrycupverse in -723
OYC
. ⅋µitǣ used the CBV system in its notes, and when it publicized them in -566 OYC, which effectively revealed the Cranberrycupverse to the public, ⅋µitǣ's system went into mainstream use.
Cran~x
[
]
The Cran~x system was first created by apprentice versologist Ɱtƭiƍ Ƹ ƪƛẉƱ when it independently discovered the Cranberrycupverse in -644
OYC
. Ɱtƭiƍ wrote its own notes on the subject, using the Cran~x system. It never publicly released its notes, so its system was unknown until rediscovery of Ɱtƭiƍ's extensive versology notes in 2319
OYC
.
Cranberryverse-x
[
]
The Cranberryverse-x system is based of off the name of the Cranberryverse, as well as ⅋µitǣ's own system for numbering.
