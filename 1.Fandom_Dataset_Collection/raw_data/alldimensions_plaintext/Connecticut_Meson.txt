Connecticut Mesons are Particles that are composed from
Down
(d) and
completely stable
Antistrange
(̄s
LΩ
)
Quark
. They are one of the constituents of
Thuonium
, and have an infinite half-life. Along with
Oklahoma Mesons
form the nucleus of Thuonium
Atoms
.
History
[
]
Connecticut Mesons were first theorized to be able to exist 2 years after the first succesful
Quantum Mutation
, in a paper published by
Sinari
inhabitant Yanau Koris titled "On the Combinations of Mutant Particles" in 2877. The first created Connecticut Particle was in the Mutated Particle beam FASU-B2.
Decay
