Primordial Hexagons are the smallest building block currently observable, being only 756 picometers in length, this unbelivabely small size makes them unable to even be seen. Due to a hexagon's ability to tile all euclidian, spherical, hyperbolic, and manouristi

surfaces, it it is theorized to have been chosen for this purpose around the same time that geometry was created. By sending countless rays of light at Primordial Hexagons, it has been determined that they reflect light in wavelengths ranging from 591 nanometers to 630 nanometers normally and can reflect light at each other in patterns to produce different hues. The fact that they do this also explains why light waves seem to be everywhere where there is matter.
An investigation of lightwaves proved that they were simply rotational vibrations of the Primordial Hexagons in the third dimension, and that the waves were spread from place to place by bouncing off Primordial Hexagons that were rotated in a different manner than the goal position of the rotation. This explains why light behaves so similarly to sound, because they are essentially the same thing on a different scale.
