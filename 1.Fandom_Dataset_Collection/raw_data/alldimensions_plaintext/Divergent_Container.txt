About
[
]
A
Divergent Container
contains multiple of the
Möbiverse
hyperchain's
verses
, specifically the verses before infinite c, and this stops at the
Metahyperchain
. We can see that the Divergent Containers contain these verses:
Hencentroverses
Toruchains
Torubarriers
These Divergent Containers rely on each of these to stay stable, with the Hencentroverse forming the outside of the container, the Toruchain keeping the Hencentroverses from collapsing into a smaller
structure
, and the 8 Torubarriers holding the chains of Toruchains together. There are also some more of these verses in the
void
around them, but they are uncommon.
Properties
[
]
Some interesting properties of the Divergent Containers are that because they have most of their mass in their center, that means they can rotate with ease. Divergent Containers are also shaped like a hypercylinder, having a hypersphere turned into a prism.
Etymology
[
]
The name 'Divergent Container' was coined because it was discovered after all of the Mobiverse hyperchain was discovered, and so it's divergent, similar to the
Extended Divergent Archverses
.
