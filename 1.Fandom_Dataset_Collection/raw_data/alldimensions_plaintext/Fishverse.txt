The
Fishverse
is a fish-shaped verse that contains a lot of dust. There is so much dust that any unprotected living thing that requires fresh molecules to survive cannot survive here due to the sheer amount of dust. This verse contains many different galaxies, typically of four different types: Fhlwafael, Isnoaps, Slieapsasas, and Hfjf. There is one galaxy in the very middle of this verse that isn't one of these four types and is instead its own galaxy. The Fishverse is also constantly rotating slowly.

What the dust is made of
[
]
The dust in this verse is made of insulated molecules. These are molecules that are stiffer and do not function properly. They are not able to conduct electricity, and also cannot form together without creating dust. The dust in the Fishverse are actually supposed to be various things, but since they are made of insulated molecules, it simply turns out to be dust.
The different types of galaxies
[
]
Fhlwafael
[
]
A Fhlwafael galaxy is basically a regular galaxy. It does not have any quirks or benefits over a typical galaxy in a typical universe. It is, however, usually smaller than the size of a typical galaxy.
Isnoaps
[
]
An Isnoaps galaxy is a galaxy that has some sort of positive charge to it. It can either be a magnetic charge, or a static one. This causes many interactions with other galaxies, which can be different types. The objects in these types of galaxies are usually metallic, sometimes magnetic, because the positive charge removes a lot of the electrons and protons in the objects, which make them metals.
These galaxies can eat up Fhlwafael galaxies like a black hole, but when colliding with a Sileapsasas galaxy, they both cancel each other out and turn into a Fhlwafael galaxy. These galaxies are usually very empty and have very few objects. They also remove all the dust from the galaxies, so all that is left in there is gas carbon.
Sileapsasas
[
]
Sileapsasas galaxies are galaxies with a negative charge to them. There are no visible objects in these galaxies since the elements always change into a gas due to the additions of protons and electrons, making every single object in this verse a gas. Since the elements cannot mix with insulated molecules, they are separate from the rest of the verse.
When this galaxy collides with a Fhlwafael galaxy, it will collapse completely and the Fhlwafael galaxy will not change size at all. However, when it collides with an Isnoaps galaxy, they will both collide and form into a Fhlwafael galaxy with the same properties above.
Hfjf
[
]
Hfjf galaxies are the strangest and most notable of the types of galaxies in the Fishverse. They are also the rarest, as only around 19% of galaxies in the Fishverse are of the Hfjf type. They are very large, and they are completely invisible to the naked eye. The outside of this type of galaxy is a refractive surface, making all light bend completely around it and making the galaxy invisible. However, if you go inside, you wouldn't be able to see anything. This is because all of the galaxy is made of a single element.
The element has the same mass, state and properties throughout the entire galaxy, but there are still objects in the galaxy that can be classified differently from the others. This is because there is a different amount of partitivitivity in each element. To figure out the amount of partitivitivity in an element, you need to figure out how much the element randomly shakes due to high pressure. Partitivitivity is difficult to measure without waiting multiple years while recording data, but it classifies identical elements into separate categories that can't be identical due to every partitivitivity number being an irrational number.
When a Hfjf galaxy collides with another galaxy, it will simply disappear completely without changing the other galaxy at all. This is likely the reason Hfjf galaxies are rarer than other types of galaxies in the Fishverse.
The galaxy in the middle
[
]
The galaxy in the middle is the biggest galaxy in the Fishverse, and is what keeps the fishverse as a spherical shape. It isn't attractive, it is actually repulsive, as anything that goes near it will just be pushed away. Therefore this galaxy doesn't have anything in it, and the only reason it is visible is because the insulated molecules from this verse's birth didn't have the properties of insulated molecules and the galaxy didn't have its repulsive property, so the molecules just stuck to the side of the galaxy.
The ring event
[
]
In 4 OYC, the galaxy in the middle of the Fishverse shot out a really big ring that wrapped around the fishverse and went to one side. This ring made everything inside it at a time disappear while it was moving to one side of the Fishverse. It pushed the side of it down and it bent the Fishverse a little bit, which made it have the shape it has now. The event removed half of the stuff in the Fishverse when it happened and one side was very empty, but the stuff in the other half quickly spread over to the half that was affected. However, any time an object goes inside the ring, it will disappear.
The outside
[
]
The outside is simply made of insulated molecules that somehow broke through the barrier. However, the barrier is attractive to insulated molecules, so it creates a bit of a ring around the Fishverse.
