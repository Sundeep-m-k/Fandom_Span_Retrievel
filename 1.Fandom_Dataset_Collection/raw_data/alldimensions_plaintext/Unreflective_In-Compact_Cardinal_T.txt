Reflective-ness
[
]
I'll explain reflection using examples.
M cardinals are inaccessible with any and all inaccessible cardinals (besides itself) using any sort of sequence. M therefore has the sequence, a-inaccessible, hyper-inaccessible, richly-inaccessible,... but the sequence does not define M. Cof(M)=M. M cardinals reflect downward onto inaccessibles due to their previously defined inaccessibility.
However, N cardinals that are inaccessible with any and all M cardinals using any sort of sequence reflects onto M, which is trivial.
Indescribable Cardinal T/In-Compactness Cardinal
[

The first cardinal greater than inaccessible cardinals that do not reflect onto other cardinals, but are also extended with some special properties off of cardinals is the In-Compactness Cardinal T. (Inaccessible cardinals reflect downwards onto smaller inaccessibles.) A in-compactness cardinal T, would require a T amount of symbols to define. This is because an infinitely extending definition would not be able to reflect downwards due to itâ€™s sheer amount of existing symbols after it and after that (infinitely looping). Also, a in-compactness cardinal T must be that largest cardinal definable with T symbols. Also, T+1 does reflect onto T, thus T+1 is a compact cardinal.
The In-Compactness Cardinal T could also be called the Indescribable Cardinal T.
