The Server is a verse on a different level of reality. Everything contained by it could be manipulated and changed as if it was a computer program by anything able to control it. Every thing a civilization has done, every verse inside, every entity, every memory, could be snuffed out as if it were a candlelight by a being that strong.
The Server is made of celluar automata, able to generate laws and data to create large level structures.
This verse is so unimaginably large that the gap between it and
The Omnifrick
is equal to the gap between
The Subfinal Verse
and

This Verse is in the shape of a box and is checked by a group of CEs known as the Devs.
