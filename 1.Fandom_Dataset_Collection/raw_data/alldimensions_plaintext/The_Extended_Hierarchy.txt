We are to inform you, The Extended Hierarchy is
a very large page

"Who actually reads these?" - fish (2023)
This is the
Extended
Hierarchy
, a continuation of the
Official one
. The pages in this are typically more unorganized and repetitive than in
classes
1
-
6
, but they also are a reminiscence to earlier versions of the Official Hierarchy. This page will be capped at class
15
. There is also a special pseudo-class at the end of this hierarchy, known as the
Finality Chain
.
Same rules of previous hierarchies apply to this one, such as:
verses
being ranked from smallest to biggest, each class having a "
Terminator
" that finishes them altogether, etc.
The Hierarchy Rank of the Extended Hierarchy is
(H
1
)
, placing it in
class 0
in
THH
.
For hierarchies going above the Extended one, see the
Everything Layers
, the
Post-Hierarchy
, and/or the hierarchies linked within the
Hierarchy Hierarchy
.

[
]
The Finality Chain is a series of containers that each increase in
Finality Index
from the previous. They are (for the most part, with
some
exceptions
) much, much larger than anything beforehand and also very distinctive, which is why they belong on a separate list. Almost all of of them also start with the word "The."
The Ball, where every single one of its properties involves circles in some way.
It should be noted that
this is not class 16
and isn't a class in general. The Finality Chain is also not the successor to Class 15, despite its placement.
