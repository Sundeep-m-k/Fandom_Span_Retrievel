The Golis Fields is a collection of fields that are part of the Signox Field Group in the Athraki Growth. It is especially unique in the way that it’s inhabitants’ neural and psychic mental waves can be transmitted and materialised through
The Undiscovered
into other verses. This is probably made possible by Golis being located on the material border of the verse growth. It should be noted that this process cannot be applied to The Great Range since that verse is not at the adequate rebound measurement for the brain signals to pass through its border due to Signox being a growth of the verse.
Activity
Inhabitants of Golis are enabled to transmit their neural and psychic mind imprints across The Undiscovered and by extension The Ultimate Voidscape. Some beings in the fields use Golis as an opening channel for their own dreams and thoughts to be broadcast into other verses through the previously mentioned scapes. This means that, in effect, other beings in most other verses can experience the Golis entities’ mental creations. Beings that utilise this method include Relix, The Card Box, Mr. Time,
Gornstrak Maleovi
and Doctor Doctor.2.
