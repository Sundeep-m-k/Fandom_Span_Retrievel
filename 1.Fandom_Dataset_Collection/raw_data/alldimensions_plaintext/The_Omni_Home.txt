The
Omni Home
is an ever-expanding verse that increases its size so that no matter how big
The Multi Omega.
gets, this verse is exactly 6x bigger.  It has an
Omega Computer
which screen contains all people in all versions of
Omegaversal Complex
systems.  However, it has ONE known weakness.
Weakness
[
]
The Omni Home's weakness was found when
The Multi Omega.
tore a hole through the wall with a REALLY, REALLY hard punch.  Theoretically, if all the walls are punched hard and fast enough, The Omni Home will completely shatter into pieces and get destroyed.
