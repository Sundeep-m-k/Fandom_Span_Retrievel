Astroverses are
the 6th smallest smallest post-
Omniversal
type of
verse
and the second Gas-verse continuing
Mistroverses
. It contains only blue gas shaped a lemniscate (infinity symbol), but its not shaped like that actually, they covered in blue gas around it and making it look like infinity.
Structure
[
]
They called Astroverses because they contains a lot of astronomical objects like a normal universe would (
Stars
,
Planets
and everything like that) but on a much bigger scale. This is a rare situation of Gas-verse containing other things and less gas than normal (also the gas is forming a shape instead being equally distributed by the astroverse area.)
