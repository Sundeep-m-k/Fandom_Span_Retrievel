How It Works
[
]
The Big Crunch
is one of the hypothetical scenarios for the fate of an
universe
. It occurs because of the quantum tunneling theory when the expanding universe eventually succumbs to the gravity, when dark energy soon runs out will slow down due to this eventually stopping.
After this, everything in the universe, starts reversing or you could call it. Getting pulled straight to the center of this universe, and the universe starts becoming smaller and smaller. And the smaller the universe gets, the temperature of the universe increases rapidly. The universe becomes hotter than stars, which means stars would eventually be melted. Atoms are ripped apart, supermassive black-holes devour everything. These black holes, would collide on-to each other and merge and merge, into an utterly massive black hole. And which, this black hole devours everything, eventually the Universe aswell. This black hole has a large chance to devour itself. And then, there is another
Big Bang
. Everything starts again with the same laws & physics.
And, then
The Big Crunch
occurs again, and it happens again. This leads us to an endless cycle and loop of big bangs and big crunches. Which we call
The Big Bounce
.
