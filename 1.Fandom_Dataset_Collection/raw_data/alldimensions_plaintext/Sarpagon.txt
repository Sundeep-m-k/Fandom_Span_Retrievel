About
[
]
The
Sarpagon
, also rarely known as the
Sarpulitaumiogonuoplexayurex
, is a
structure
containing infinite amounts of
Distorial cubes
. It expands by an infinite factor every omni-instant too. It operates similarly to the
Infinite Boxes
and
Infinite Warehouses
.
To
individuals
who are not beyond the
AntepÃ­thesi's Class
, the Sarpagon may look incomprehensible due to its properties.
Trivia
[
]
Objects
within the Sarpagon are bouncy. This, combined with the fact it is constantly expanding and
containing itself
, makes the insides of the Sarpagon a complete mess where life outside the Distorial cubes is impossible.
Despite this, the properties of the Distorial Cubes prevent them from being affected by the Sarpagon's insides.
Sarpagons are the one thing
Hwagonoids
avoid because they will get crushed to death.

Aw, man! Not again, it's a black hole!

Sarpagon is one of the most powerful voids, because it is only 0.00001% matter, and the 'matter' is just letters. Fill in the void by
