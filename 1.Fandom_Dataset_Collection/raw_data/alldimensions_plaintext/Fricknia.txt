, with its packing efficency of them being lower than 1/15, meaning for every measure of distance, on average you will find a ratio of 14 spaces of void to 1 space of Fricksville. In a Fricksville, all of the
Downtown Fricksvilles
within have a property or many properties that connects them to the other Downtown Fricksvilles, but in a Fricknia, no such connection is present between Fricksvilles. This allows for far more diverse Downtown Fricksvilles, as there are more combinations of laws, rules, and existences that can be used. ℵ

fully industrialized outposts. You know that Fricksvilles move F A S T, but the thing that they are moving towards is another Fricksville with a Downtown Fricksville inside it that has a property that connects it to the other's main connecting  property between all of their Downtown Fricksvilles. After getting less than 0.8 centimeters from each other, one of the Fricksvilles ejects its Downtown Fricksville into the other and they deflect off of one another.
Although most Downtown Fricksvilles are grouped into Fricksvilles, not all are, with 1/1115 being rogue. Rogue Downtown Fricksvilles are Downtown Fricksvilles that couldn't be sorted into a discrete category and were caught between two different Fricksvilles. These rogue Downtown Fricksvilles can impede travel and make it harder for Fricksvilles to arrive at their destination and this can cause them to knock off tiny pieces from them and changing some of its properties slightly, making even more rogue Downtown Fricksvilles. Rogue Downtown Fricksvilles usually clump up into real Fricksvilles and finish forming within 13 minutes.
