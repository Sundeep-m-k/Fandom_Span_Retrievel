The
Immortalverse
is a verse that contains extremely powerful entities, including gods and other deities, with all of them being immortal. Despite its small size, the Immortalverse's barrier is very resistant to damage so even the strongest gods from the verse are unable to destroy it. It's extremely hard to enter this verse not only due to its resistance, but also because there is a massive gravitational pull that has the ability to crush non-gods into atomic dust.
