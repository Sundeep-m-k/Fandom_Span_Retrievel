The Streets

Kalatom
is a type of
verse
responsible of containing
Streets

Organismverse
.

Œ£ Sector 1: Crimson Chasm Œ£
[
]
The smallest sector within our
Kalatom
, the Crimson Chasm is the 2nd most biologically diverse sector, despite its size. For 14 years it's been ruled over by
Der Dackel
after he has been given the power of a praeter god, until he eventually he got bored and decided to not rule over any verse. It's made up of mostly extremely strong building-like structures that are composed of
Class

verses. These structures usually contain large,
Perdita
-like "greenhouses" of some sort, inhabited by trees that are usually the length of a
Box
.
œë Sector 2: Viridescent Vivarium œë

Œ® Sector 3: Cerulean Confines Œ®
[

This sector is the center and core of our Kalatom. It has a high amount of Streets, along with rogue
Yamaverses

Kalatom is one of the most powerful voids, because it is only 0.00001% matter, and the 'matter' is just letters. Fill in the void by
