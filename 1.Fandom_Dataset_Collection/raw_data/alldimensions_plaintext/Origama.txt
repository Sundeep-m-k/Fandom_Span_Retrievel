Orroverses
Origamas are huge clusters of
Orroverses
, they are big, greedy and expansionists, sometimes Origamas send out
Orroverses
to grow and expand, but if an Origama get to big, they explode, makeing more Origamas in the process. The Origamas also have streched matter in them. Its because they can fold up, makeing matter there streched.
Insides
[
]
The inside of an Origama are glitchy and broken. Its why trying to explain the insides dont work, it broken and glitchy, that why the Origama even looks like that. its because of the extreme denseity and mass. If you took a suger cube of an Origami, it would weigh an entire multiverse.
Shell
[
]
The shells of Origamas are transparent, smooth and deadly. The shell has sharp spikes that elongate when a Origama senses an object, but if the sharp spikes dont work then a wide hole opens, engulfing the object compleatly and turning it into Mega Atoms so they can create more
Orroverses
.
Middle
[
]
The middle of an Origama is a super massive black hole that has a charge, and the black hole is only kept by negative charges.
Origama Chains
[
]
Origama Chains are chains of Origama formed by magnetic fields, but those magnetic fields only attract themselfs. The Origamas group up they and send out chemicals and change their magnetic charges to identify if an origami is a friend, or foe. Origama chains have no limit on how big they can be, but the Origamas Chain can decide to become something else if they want.
