The Key
is an
universe
with the unique property of being truly uncontainable. Despite it's distance, teleporting to The Key is as easy as teleporting to a neighboring universe. The Key also appears to have a warmer average temperature than the average universe at -142.33°C. The key is also one of the biggest universes, being bigger than a lot of
Megaverses
. Despite it being impossible to contain, many organizations and entities have tried to contain it. The Key was created when
Alphasm
attempted to make an object that could not be contained.

[

Attempt 1: The H.C.L.O.

Alphasm
[

After the H.C.L.O.'s failed attempt to contain the key,
Alphasm
stepped up to contain The Key.
Alphasm
attempt to imagine an object that would specifically contain The Key. At first, it appeared to work, but after closer analysis, this "Key" was found out to be a fake.
Attempt 3:
Transcendent Omni-Gods
[
]
The
TOG
s (Transcendent Omni-Gods) made a Pageverse in the
Wikiverse
in an attempt to contain The Key. Like
Alphasm
's attempt, the verse the Pageverse contained was a fake.
Attempt 3.1:
TOGs 2
[
]
A TOG made a
page
of a verse that had the property of containing everything smaller than it. However, it just contained a bunch of copies of The Key.
Attempt 4:
The Nirvanian
[
]
The Nirvanian
is currently the last thing to try to contain The Key.
The Nirvanian
made an indestructible lock to finally contain The Key once and for all. However, The Key opened and destroyed the lock that was attempting to contain it.
