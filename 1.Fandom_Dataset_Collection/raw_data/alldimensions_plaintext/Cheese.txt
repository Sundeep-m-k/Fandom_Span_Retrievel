Cheese is part of one of
Alphasm
's memories, which manifests in its imagination. This makes it so that every civilization that develops in it develop some way of creating cheese (in our case it was through milk), down to the proteins. Even if the
archverse
they inhabit does not allow the proteins,
molecules
,
atoms
or
particles
that are used to make cheese to exist, then cheese will just be made with whatever is permitted. If the particles that exist in the archverse are physically and logically incapable of constructing any structure of that size, then luck is twisted by Alphasm's subconcious for even a slight bit of cheese to be dropped there.
Another one of cheese's properties is the fact that it is immune to hypercooling (temperatures below 0ÂºK, which is impossible in our universe due to the particles needing to have negative energy) like in
hendaverses
.
Cheese also occurs in
Cheeseverses
and the
Cheesiverse.
