Artist interpretation of a Class L Star
Class L stars are
stars
with a mass of 65 - 80
solar
masses. Class L contains both the coolest main-sequence stars and the hottest
brown dwarfs
. Class L stars have spectral lines with metal hydrides like FeH or CrH and alkali metals. Their temperature is generally 1,000 to 2,000ºC. The most massive class L stars can actually fuse hydrogen and helium, while the lighter ones fuse deuterium and lithium. They are dark red and are very prominent in infrared.
Life

For there to be life around a class L star, the planet orbiting it must be very extremely close, which makes it probably tidally locked. Only 52 known civilisations developed around these stars in the entire
Multiverse
.
