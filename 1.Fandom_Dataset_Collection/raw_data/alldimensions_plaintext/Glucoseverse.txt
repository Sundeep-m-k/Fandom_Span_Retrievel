The Glucoseverse is a failed verse supposed to be composed of only three chemical elements (hydrogen, carbon and oxygen). The verse was ultimately destroyed.

The Glucoseverse as a concept was first thought of by ≆≉≟≃≅≉≉≜≙≝≠≉≅≔≔≋≈≟≅≙, a
Koilestel
with a particular affinity to wormholes. However, one thing not considered was the eventual fusion of hydrogen used to create the verse into helium. The verse used to contain carbon, oxygen and hydrogen structures. After millions of years, the verse began becoming increasingly unstable, as hydrogen and helium started forming stars, which eventually burned out after billions of years. In the end, the black holes created ended the verse for good.

For ≆≉≟≃≅≉≉≜≙≝≠≉≅≔≔≋≈≟≅≙ the Glucoseverse was a failed project that ended his purpose, and because of that ≆≉≟≃≅≉≉≜≙≝≠≉≅≔≔≋≈≟≅≙ was self-absorbed inside a paradox. Most Koilestels have forgotten the Glucoseverse's history and even the fact that it existed at all.
