PD (Primordial Dimension) is a unit used to measure the dimensions for primordial objects. There are no words in the English language (or any language really) to describe what a Primordial Dimension really is once you get past 2 PD. Please note that even 1 PD is somewhat ill-defined due to the extreme complexity of Primordial Dimensions.
List of Primordial Dimensions and their definition

PD
1
: An extremely complex dimension that describes the containment of all things smaller than it. The way said objects are contained in such dimension is unique and varies depending on the exact size. The containment may be physical, nonphysical, metaphysical, or some different kind of existence entirely.
PD
2
: An impossibly more complex dimension that is based off an extension of the definition of PD
1
. The containment of the objects can be alaziphysical, meaning they are constantly changing their physicality. This may also include the
Finality Index
or
Existence Rank
, which usually involves the object being contained rather than the container itself, however it can still rarely apply to the container. Such objects with this dimension will also be able to change their size randomly, even if they aren’t sentient or wouldn’t previously have the ability to do so if they weren’t this dimension. They can also change shape too. Also, these objects break the laws of everything in such a way that humans can not describe it.
