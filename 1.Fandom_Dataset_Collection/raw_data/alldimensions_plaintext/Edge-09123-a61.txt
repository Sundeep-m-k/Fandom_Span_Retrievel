This neutron star is a normal neutron star a normal one. This neutron star has a supermassive blackhole inside ot this star also it has more gamma ray bursts way more often and has stricken more planets in its life ime. This star was discovered when scientist often inspected Gamma ray bursts from one area and discovered this neutron star and named it Edge-o9123-a61, it made sense.

comparison between the two
There isn't much known about this star, but there are some theories like the star formed from a star collision forming a neutron star capable of  destroying Jupiter like planets with a single burst, there's a most likely one the star formed like any star and right when it formed a huge meteor that's the size of Arrokoth and made it change size and some ow have more often gamma ray bursts making it one of the most deadliest star ever if it were to hit earth we would all perish in more thatn10 to 5 hours. This star is near the size of the sun, but way deadlier (comparison is below).

After the explosions from a gamma ray burst the Pluto sized planet Edge-07563-zb82 and gave it a ring system.
the supermassive gas giant Edge-er234-5342
As we discussed this star is a class 3 neutron star, it cannot be found in the night sky because it's' so far away the images of it are almost the lowest quality ever known. This star is also has ended multiple planets such as edge-06123-ab12 and exoplanet likely of having life was stricken by one of its burst's and destroying the planet in seconds and destroying other planets around it like Edge-07563-zb82 a Pluto size planet was also hit by the exoplanets material and giving the planet rings and some "moons" the explosion also made comets  now flying in the solar system they go at least 100 million miles an hour a day.  You can also make the comparison that Rigel and Edge (for short) are almost identical, but one is deadly and one is a blue star. This solar system consists of supermassive gas giants like Edge-er234-5342 (the images are below) and its bigger than Jupiter its core is made up of Magama and obsidian this place also rains acid. It spins on its axis 6 degrees (I'm not good at measurements) a entire day on this planet is 3.4 earth years, so if you land there in 2021 you will come back ain2024, and you would probably die the planet also has no atmosphere and more UV rays get sucked into it.
