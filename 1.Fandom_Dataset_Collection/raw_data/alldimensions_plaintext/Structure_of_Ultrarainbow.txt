A structure of ultrarainbow is a kind of
Box
that is the most colorful structure to currently exist, consisting of only colors and no grayscale.
Even the text on this page is colorful as it for some reason also counts towards how colorful this verse is, much like the
Orangeverse
, except the infobox text is still not saturated because it can't be controlled.
The color of the text also seems to move onto the next color of the rainbow or loop in color every sentence on this page.
The only things contained by structures of ultrarainbow are entities known as Rainbow Beings, which have no objective.
The reason this verse is so colorful is because it automatically filters out all grayscale inside and replaces it with another color in under a
Yalmeon Time
due to the strange laws in this kind of verse.
