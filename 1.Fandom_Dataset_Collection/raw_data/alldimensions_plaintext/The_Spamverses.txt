The Spamverses
[
]
There are exactly 5 Spamverses. All of them were created at roughly the same time, in 10893
OYC
. All of them are perfectly spherical and exactly 10 LY across.
Spamverse #1 (The Poopverse)
[
]
The first Spamverse, also known as the Poopverse, was a verse filled with only poop. It was extremely disgusting, and it also smelled extremely bad. All explorers that entered Spamverse #1 fainted in less than 1 minute after visiting the verse, and died roughly 10 minutes later.
No life ever existed in Spamverse #1 because of the smell of the Spamverse. Spamverse #1 had also caused life outside it to die of the stench. Because of that, this verse was the first Spamverse to be terminated by YellowMarkers1 due to just how dangerous it is.
Spamverse #2 (The Nothingverse)
[
]
Spamverse #2, also known as the Nothingverse, was simply a void. This Spamverse was quite safe, and the only thing inside was microscopic life similar to tardigrades that floated around this Spamverse.
This verse was the last verse to be terminated by YellowMarkers1 due to it just being another void in the cosmos and because its danger level was very low.
Spamverse #3 (The Linkverse)
[
]
Spamverse #3, also known as the Linkverse, was a Spamverse with tons of unnecessary links, tunnels that connect verses together on a higher reality. This Spamverse was created by Rwa45r.
This Spamverse was the second Spamverse to be terminated by YellowMarkers1.
Spamverse #4 (The Unoriginal Verse)
[
]
Spamverse #4, also known as
The Random Hallway
, was a mostly empty verse containing several microorganisms. The microorganisms created a monarchy, with a king at the top and worker microorganisms at the bottom. This Spamverse got terminated due to its name being so similar to
another thing
.
When YellowMarkers1 terminated it, the entire microorganism monarchy got wiped out, and now there is no life anymore.
It was the 4th Spamverse to get terminated by YellowMarkers1.
Spamverse #5 (The Buildings Verse)
[
]
Spamverse #5, also known as the The Buildings Verse, was a Spamverse that solely consisted of broken English and random buildings such as the
Portidomverse
,
Omniverse Tower
,
Teylomonomega Tower
, and many more horrible things.
This verse was the 3rd Spamverse to get terminated by YellowMarkers1.
