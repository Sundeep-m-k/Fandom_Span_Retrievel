The BMTC had solved 2 issues on how to escape the local
Universe
. Manufactured in the year 2982, The BMTC is the first to utilise Insta-Warping, the first technique that would allow MTCs to ‚Äòhop‚Äô universes, as the abyss was a very unstable and unforgiving void, and you may have just stopped existing.
Due to the requirement of actually aiming in the right direction, the BMTC was never released for public use, and personal MTCs were not released until the AMTC came around in 3012. Unofficially, however, the ASBMTC (Abyss Shielded BMTC) came around about 12 years earlier, when abyss shielding was invented. Howeve, it was not very popular due to A. you still having to instawarp in and out of a Universe (which wasted fuel), and B. Nobody really cared.
The BMTC was really only a commercial transport ship, and its large size aided in that. We don‚Äôt know how expensive it was, but estimates say about 100,000‚íº. The ASBMTC was actually a little cheaper than the BMTC due to manufacturing costs going down and also it being much, much smaller, so the ASBMTC cost about 10,000‚íº. The high costs meant that it was only for upper class citizens.
Overall, the BMTC was only really meant to be a prototype, nothing more. However, the ASBMTC was actually quite luxurious though. It had precision controls, the likes of which were not even seen in the
UUTC
. The ASBMTC was, in fact manufactured by FishCorp, and it was the first FishCorp-manufactured VTC we know of. FishCorp‚Äôs monopoly of the market really came in 3292, when the first
MgTCs
were released. To this day, the Galactic Currency (‚íº), is still used, but for verses beyond the Multiverse, FishCorp (now part of FEESH), rule the
Feeshverse

The AMTC.
Speed
Compared to other upgrades, not actually that much faster - Can accelerate up to 76.9 quadrillion c, however instawarps over 430 trillion ly while only using 5% of fuel

The AMTC was a banger that shocked the Universe. Even though it wasn‚Äôt actually that much faster, sales, including those from corporations, skyrocketed. As well as this, the addition of abyss shielding made this available to the public. And while the floating pyramid at the top was reportedly ‚Äòa purely aesthetic feature‚Äô, it may have worked - first time sales were over 12,985% higher.
The ability to instawarp using 3x less fuel was a cool feature, but the abyss shield made that obsolete - it was now possible to just smash through the
Universe‚Äôs
barrier, which further expedited
Multiversal
travel. With the AMTC being much larger, commercial uses were also extended. The pyramid at the top was the control center, but how to get to it?
Well, it had a teleporting gate. This also meant that the top of the AMTC could be used to send over items to the main vehicle and also remotely control it, if it was detached, but the GG warned that ‚Äúyou should not do this‚Äù and ‚Äúyour vehicle may be hijacked‚Äù. Lol nerds ü§ìü§ìü§ì
Anyways, serious now. Let‚Äôs talk features. The AMTC had 4 doors and a maintenance hatch, which could be blocked if you wanted maintenance to be automated (which wasn‚Äôt actually reccomended, unlike in the
EUTC
. It also had a megadoor (for storing smaller VTCs), a garage door (which could be covered and was for shipping and a regular entry door, obviously. However, the garage and megadoors were not included in the Consumer Edition.
The Consumer edition had about 10x less volume, but was still pricey, at about 5,000‚íº. The commercial edition was even pricier, at a whopping 50,000-200,000‚íº depending on time (what year it was) and place.

The EMTC. I think this is my favourite one, at least so far.
Speed
Now THIS one is much faster - Can accelerate up to 12.1 quintillion c, and at maximum warp (not reccomended), 669.2 quintillion, however instawarps over 10 QUADRILLION ly while using less than 0.5% of fuel!!

One of the most prominent new features of the EMTC was that it had a substantially larger fuel tank. This allowed the EMTC to go much further. It also used a new kind of fuel - Naquadah. Naquadah, number 225 on the Periodic table, is a radioactive, extremely energy dense liquid. It is
hyperradioactive
, however less so than other elements on that list.
It gets more radioactive and loses potency faster, the hotter it is, so cooling in the fuel room is essential. It can heat up in the power generator STAY AWAY FROM IT!
The top is much harder to remove this time, due to reasons mentioned in the
AMTC
. Now, that aside, here‚Äôs the main page.
Invented in 3065, the EMTC can accelerate up to 121 quintillion c or about 3.84 trillion ly / s. At maximum warp (which was not reccomended due to fuel being hyperradioactive, over 669.2 quintillion c, or 20.9 trillion ly / s! As well as this, instawarping became much moe fuel effective.
Apart from this (and the fact that it is MAD expensive - 500,000‚íº, with the cost of fueling long term being arguably more expensive), the EMTC isn‚Äôt
that
different from the
AMTC
.
Since its release date, several revisions have been made to improve consumer safety. These include hyperradiation proofing, subzero cooling and switching the fuel for safer alternatives. Though these revisions were mainly introduced after the UMTC released.
The EMTC now runs on Naraquadite, which is gaseous. EMTCs were also discontinued for the public due to fear of a gas or liquid leak.
civilization decided to take photos of the great invention by simply flying behind this transport from behind. 2 photos were taken. One when everything was fine, and the second when there was a breakdown and the transport began to fall apart and then collapsed.

The UMTC. It‚Äôs purple! :D
Speed
Crazy fast - Can accelerate up to 879 quintillion c, and at warpspeed, 3.9 sextillion. It can instawarp over 100 quadrillion ly.

The UMTC was a massive project funded partially by private celestial companies for insane transportation speeds. Capable to cross a
Multiverse
in mere seconds was, as some put it, a massive technological leap. It had not much in the way of cool sci-fi weaponry, but certainly was impressive - being able to travel 120 trillion (that‚Äôs right, 120 trillion) ly/s, and instawarp pretty much through a 1/3 of a
Multiverse
. The UMTC did not have a price, surprisingly, and was handed out to select large companies to boost their sales.
The universal, or should I say multiversal speed limit of our
Multiverse
is about 139 trillion ly/s. This meant that the UMTC was often capable of breaking reality or tearing the fabric of existence if misused. As well as this, it could affect time drastically, so of course the GG was smart and only handed it out to 19 companies, the identity of 12 of them is still unknown, but it is assumed they went bankrupt time immemorial ago.
The
BKTC
‚Äôs model is based almost entirely off the UMTC, thus, their speeds are not too dissimilar. The AMTC and EMTC are still used today for multiversal transport, depending on your wallet.
