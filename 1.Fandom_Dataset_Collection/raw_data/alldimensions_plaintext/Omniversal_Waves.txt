Omniversal Waves
are a type of electromagnetic wavelength that is used to transmit data across
Omniverses
. These waves can travel at a crazy speed of approximately 2 million Omniverses a second. They are invisible to the naked eye. The waves are also extremely large as well, being approximately
1
8
{\displaystyle \frac{1}{8}}
the size of an Omniverse.
Many kinds of data can be transmitted through Omniversal Waves, including MP3s, Exe files, jpeg files, audio files, gifs, etc. Only very, VERY strong radios can detect Omniversal Waves.
