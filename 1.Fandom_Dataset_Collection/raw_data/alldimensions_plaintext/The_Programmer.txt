The Programmer is a cosmic entity that rules over, programmed, built, and is currently trapped in the
Terminal Terminal
. He does not let anybody
ever
use the Terminal Terminal because they don't want to risk their Terminal Terminal to be at risk of a virus.
The Programmer, as previously mentioned, created the Terminal Terminal and is the only person who can code in it. He constructed it and built it from scratch, but was then trapped from it as he programmed it.
Based on how the Terminal Terminal was built, The Programmer can operate it from inside the simulation and programs on it full-time, and is currently trying to escape the simulation and get back into the real world.
The Programmer is also powerful even without the Terminal Terminal, and can instantly digitize every verse smaller than him, as well as being able to create
Blueprint Particles
in any configuration from his hands.
