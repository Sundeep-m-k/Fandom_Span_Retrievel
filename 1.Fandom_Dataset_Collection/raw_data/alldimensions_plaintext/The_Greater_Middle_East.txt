Description
[
]
The greater middle east is a network of intertwined new countries that recently came into existence as rebellions from Terabithia or Redland. The region is constantly at war with itself and it is constantly monitored by the
LUA
. The nations there are:
Tuvalon
The Central Empire
Sentinol
Convenna
Marenchia
Theria
Valeria
Harlen Empire
The Republic of Aurielle and
Moke
The Central Empire, Sentinol and Marenchia are at war so often that the government is shifted to an entirely new place every few days because of the fear of carbon bombs. In fact, Marenchia has invaded
Terabithia
so often that
Terabithia
built the Origanco wall to stop them invading deep into the country and also permanently relocated people that lived near the border of Marenchia.
Despite the many wars and threats in the region, there are a few thriving cities and countries in the area that have not gotten into many wars.
