The
Alboverse
is a
verse
where everything is white. The reason why it's called the Alboverse is because it's derived from the Latin word, "album", meaning "white" in English.
Alboversians, and all creatures which inhabit this verse, have vision, because this verse doesn't have evolution like our Universe does. The vision is useless, for the most part, but if the creatures decide to exit the verse, if they can, then they are able to see more than just white.
The Alboversians, being the smart creatures they are, are able to use their scent to locate objects, but they have also made computers turn this scent and mix it with the sounds around to display a somewhat accurate 3D rendition of the world around them.
This is what Alboversians see. They're still able to identify others by their scent.
