strength:
V
∗
H
{\displaystyle V*H}
where V is the volume (in m
3
.) of what the entity can best destroy and H is the average hardness of what the entity can best destroy
speed:
D
T
{\displaystyle {\frac {D}{T}}}
in ft.
durability: strength but instead of what the entity can best destroy it’s the entity itself.
defeat: the total PL of what entity can be beaten by this entity at the highest difficulty.
Total PL: sum up every stat.
transcending
[
]
if a stat is transcended by the entity, a new constant named
[
(first 2 letters of the stat name)
:
(the entity’s name shortened into 3 letters)
]
(or just [T]) will be created to fit that level.
an example for
The Crearion
would be [PL:CRN].
