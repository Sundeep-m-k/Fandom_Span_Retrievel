Description
[
]
The
Respirationverse
or
Oxygenverse
is a verse which contains all the natural breathable gas by any living organism. As there are more than just humans, this verse also produces gases that are breathable for other organisms, but unbreathable for humans. This is the reason why there is a lot of nitrogen in the Respirationverse, because most organisms need nitrogen to live.
Gas Transportation
[
]
Now, all that gas is transported to any inferior and superior universes which have life, meaning that verses like a dead verse will not be given gasses to, the method the verse transports the gas with is currently unknown, but it is theorized to be
passive breakthrough gas transportation
.
Method: Passive breakthrough gas transportation
[
]
A passive breakthrough gas transportation is the current most believable theory of how the respirationverse produces its gas, the method is that it is theorized the gasses break through the universes protection layer, even
boxes
, and then transports the gas to the required location, although this may sound very scary because the beam of gas is so strong it can break stuff like
the box
, it is completely harmless, as it also transports box tissue revival (also all other tissue revivals depends on where it goes) which heals the stuff experiencing a passive breakthrough gas transportation.
Tissue revival
[
]
A tissue revival object is a object which can revive anything, but you need specific ingredients for specific objects alike;
the box
,
the barrel
,
omniverse
, etc.
Trivia
[
]
This verse produces gas to us, and every other verse in need.
This verse is very important to life, even for organisms that dont need to breath, because they need to eat, and the prey might need gas, without food, starving, death, ecosystem destruction.
Due to loads of tissue revivals in the verse, anything trying to destroy it will be killed and the verse will revive itself.
