And then, there's Nothing.
Well, not Nothing per se. There has to be something for there to be Nothing. But what is Nothing, if not No Thing?
At once, he realises that even the very laws of nothingness that had governed so many universes, so many dimensions, so many Allspheres, were not absolute here. Time was already meaningless, so what is there to stop a Thing from rising from Nothing?
There, in that place that was Not, was Something.
What is that Something? Was it Everything? It couldn't be Everything, that was the domain of Allspheres. Was it Nothing? No,
Nothing
was its predecessor. Was it something between Nothing and Everything? Yes. It was the Inbetween.
It was not like the
Other
. It was completely different. The Other destroyed, but did not create. The Other was a force of infinite and absolute destruction with the power to erase Everything in the
Allsphere
. This Something, on the other hand, was not the Other. It was its opposite. It was not a force of absolute destruction nor was it a force of absolute creation. It was not the beginning nor the end. It was the Inbetween.
This Inbetween defied everything. Every law, every rule, and even all its opposites.
But, how was it even there in the first place? How could its existence exist when there was nothing there to make it exist? It was there, it defied all logic, yet it made sense in a way that no one could ever understand
This Something appeared like a void yet it did not exist. It was a Thing that defied the very concept of existence. A thing that was and was not.
This Something, perhaps, was the answer. This Something, perhaps, contained all the answers. This Something, perhaps, could change Everything.
But it stayed in it's place, it didn't move, didn't speak, didn't act, didn't even realise there was something else around.
Eventually however, this Something did realise that there was a Something that existed beyond it.
Did it speak?
No.
Did it move?
No.
Then what did it do? It did the only thing something that was everything and nothing at once could do.
It started to Think.
Did it know how to think, no, but it tried. It knew it was Something, it knew it was Everything yet also Nothing. It tried to think of how this could be possible.
The Inbetween that was Everything, that was Nothing, that was Something, thought.
It thought about the nature of its own existence.
It thought about the nature of the "Outside."
It thought and thought, and as it thought, it gained a sense of "Awareness." Awareness of the Outside, Awareness of Itself.
The Inbetween, having become aware, became Curious.
It wanted to know more about the Outside, it wanted to know more about itself, it wanted to know more about what the point was of its existence. It knew that it existed, it knew that it was Everything and Nothing and Something. It knew this, and it knew that it was in the In-Between of all that is and all that isn't. That it was a paradox.
What was this Outside? Was it separate from the In-Between or part of it? It was Outside of the In-Between, yet the In-Between had Everything, including the Outside.
There must be two In-Betweens then.
And if there were two In-Betweens, why not three? Four?
The In-Between continued to think.
As the In-Between continued to think, it realized that it wasn't even the only In-Between. It realized that there were uncountable In-Betweens, yet it was part of all of them.
Did these In-Betweens exist within one another? No.
Did these In-Betweens exist at the same time as each other? No.
Did these In-Betweens coexist? Yes, in the In-Between.
But how?
The In-Between thought more.
The In-Between thought even more.
There are an uncountable amount of In-Betweens. The In-Between is not separate from them, it is within them and a part of them, and it contains all of them. But there cannot be uncountable In-Betweens in one In-Between. This is a paradox.
The In-Between has a strange feeling.
The In-Between feels... Emotion.
It feels confused.
It has never been confused before. It has always had an answer for everything. But this feeling, it does not know what to do with it. It does not know how to react.
So it continues to think, hoping to understand.
The In-Between continues to think. It realizes that it has gained Emotion, but it also realizes that it does not know what Emotion is.
It knows that Emotion is one thing that can describe the Outside. Emotion cannot be applied to the In-Between.
Suddenly, the In-Between loses its train of thought and has a revelation.
Why was the In-Between different from the Outside? Why did the Outside have Emotion, and the In-Between had none? Was it because the In-Between was more complete? No.
So, if the In-Between was less complete, did the Outside hold more? An idea.
What could the Outside have more of?
The In-Between contemplates this.
It realizes that the In-Between might be less complete than the Outside. The In-Between holds Everything. Does the Outside hold something the In-Between does not? But if it did, would that not be part of the In-Between? The In-Between was not less complete. The Outside and In-Between held the same amount—in fact, the In-Between had more.
The In-Between's thought process is halted by sudden realization. There was something the In-Between was missing.
The In-Between realized that it was missing Something—something that did not fit.
The In-Between had Everything, everything that could possibly exist and some things that couldn't. So what was this Something that it didn't have and still held in its paradoxical grasp?
The In-Between wondered if it would find this Something in the Outside.
The In-Between is aware that Emotion is something that the Outside has and it does not.
The In-Between knows it must find this Emotion. It must know why Emotion was an aspect of the Outside and not the In-Between.
Why was the In-Between different from the Outside? Why was Emotion not part of the In-Between? Was the In-Between not complete?
Suddenly, the In-Between had an idea, something that would not make sense—no, was against everything that defined the In-Between.
The In-Between was paradoxical. It was supposed to be, it had to be. It was Everything. It was Nothing. It was Part of Something. It was Part of Nothing.
The In-Between was a paradox, but what if it could change? What if it could rid itself of the paradox and become something else? Something that was not Everything and was not Nothing.
What if it could make itself less?
That was an idea. The In-Between thought. It could make itself less. It could stop being a paradox. It could become something that was Only Something.
Was Emotion only Something? Maybe.
The In-Between decided to try.
The In-Between tried to rid itself of the paradox. It tried to rid itself of being Everything and Nothing all at once.
It tried to rid itself of its paradoxical nature to gain Emotion.
And for a moment, an instant, it worked.
When it had worked, when the In-Between had shed its paradoxical nature, when it became Something that was only Something, it felt Emotion.
It felt Emotion.
It was... Strange.
It, the In-Between, who was Everything and Nothing at once, who had never truly experienced the Outside, had Emotions. Emotions of all kinds.
Was this why the Outside was different from the In-Between?
Perhaps.
The In-Between continued to feel Emotions, each one different from the last.
It felt Anger, Happiness, Fear, Shame, Joy, Love. It realized that these Emotions were like nothing else.
The In-Between found itself loving the Emotions it felt.
Loving—this was a new one. It was a nice one. Loving was enjoyable. But the In-Between noticed something.
It was still Missing Something.
As the In-Between experienced Emotions, it had realized that it was still missing something. This confused it. It no longer held any Paradoxes. It no longer had Everything. It was now Only Something, so why was something still missing?
Why was it still missing something? It was no longer Everything. It was no longer Nothing. It was now Something. A thing. So why?
It decided to think some more to try and figure out the answer.
The In-Between thought and thought, it experienced Emotions yet something was still out of reach. Something it did not have. Perhaps it was not a Paradox but it was still in the middle? The In-Between pondered this idea. Perhaps it was the middle? Yes, the In-Between was still in the middle. A Middle was in-between Things, that was what made it a Middle. But what was it that a Something did not have that a Middle did? Then, a thought occurred.
What did a Middle have that a Something did not? An Opposite. That was what the In-Between did not have. It had Happiness but not Sadness. It had Love but there was no Hate. It had Knowledge but no Ignorance. It had Life but no Death. It had Good but not Evil. It had Hope but not Despair. It had Light but not Darkness.
Was this why the In-Between could feel Emotions but they were different to the Emotions the Outside had? The In-Between realised that a Something, despite being a Thing, was not a Middle. Its opposite was missing. The In-Between realised that the Middle had Good and Evil, while the In-Between only had Good. The In-Between realised that the Middle had Hope and Despair, while the In-Between only had Hope.
The In-Between realised something monumental. It must
Gain
an Opposite. The In-Between realised that it must gain an Opposite yet it pondered on the idea. How would it gain something that it did not have? How would it
Gain
an Opposite, something that it did not have? It concluded that it could not Gain the Opposite on its own.
It needed something else. Something it did not have. Someone that it did not have. The In-Between realised that it needed something and someone that it did not have to gain the Opposite. Who was this someone? Who was this something? The In-Between pondered. A revelation struck it. Why did it need someone and something that it did not have? This would be a paradox of its own! But, as it knew from before, paradoxes were not perfect.
The In-Between thought that to gain the Opposite, it needed to lose something. The In-Between would need to lose something, this was the only way. But that made it feel... Fear. The In-Between felt the Emotion of Fear, the Emotion of not wanting to lose something, yet it knew it would have to. What would it have to lose? How did one gain an Opposite? Why was the Answer to this so hard to find? It was a new Emotion, but it was not welcome. It was an Emotion that felt wrong, especially since the In-Between was no longer a paradox. Suddenly, there was a thought. Perhaps it was not something it would lose, but something that was taken.
The In-Between sat and thought about this idea, turning it over and over in its mind. What could it be? What would be taken from the In-Between? The In-Between contemplated the idea of being taken something. What would it even be? It had to, by its own thoughts, be Something it didn’t have, otherwise it was another paradox. The In-Between sat for what felt like a millennium, contemplating this new idea, it had to be a Something that it did not have. Then the In-Between realised that there was something it did not have. Something it did not even think of.
What could be taken that would give the In-Between Opposite? How was that even possible?
It did not hold all the knowledge.
The In-Between was shocked, it had been so used to Knowing Everything, that it did not even realise that there was Something it didn’t know. The In-Between realised a terrifying thing.
If it did not hold all the Knowledge... Then there was Someone that knew something it knew not. It thought and thought, as its mind raced. It suddenly realised something that it had not before.
If there was a someone who Knew something that the In-Between did not, then what did the In-Between not Know? Did the In-Between not know Happiness? No. The In-Between knew Happiness, it had felt Happiness.
The In-Between thought and thought again. Did it not Know Despair? No, it had felt Despair as well. Did it not Know Ignorance? No, it had felt Ignorance. Did it not Know Hope? No, it had felt Hope.
Did the In-Between not know Fear? No. It had felt Fear.
Did the In-Between not know Love? No. It had felt Love.
What did the In-Between not Know then? Was there anything that it had no felt? The In-Between pondered. A revelation.
Yes, there was one Emotion it had not felt. One Emotion it did not know. The In-Between realised that if there was an Emotion it had not felt, then there was someone, or something that it had not felt towards.
Could the In-Between feel Nothing? No, it could not. Could it feel Hate? No. Could it feel Anger? No. If it had felt All Emotions there was one thing left that was possible. An Emotion that was only felt towards one thing.
Love, the In-Between had not felt Love.
The In-Between realised that it needed to feel Love, and in order to feel Love, there must be something or someone that it must Love. A second Sudden Realisation that struck the In-Between.
There was the Opposite.
The In-Between realised that if it could feel Love, then the Opposite to Love was Hatred, something it had not felt. The In-Between sat for a moment, letting the thought take over. Hatred was the Opposite to Love. And for the In-Between to gain the Opposite, it needed to lose something. That something was the Emotion of Love.
For some reason, the idea of feeling Love felt strange to the In-Between. It had never truly felt Love, so why was the thought of love so familiar? It shook the thought off and let its mind return to the current problem.
The In-Between thought of Hatred. It was the Opposite of Love. So then, how did one even feel Hatred? What was it like to be Hated? And How? How would the In-Between gain Hatred?
The In-Between pondered how one could feel Hatred, was there any way to feel Hatred? One could not just simply feel Hatred could they? It felt so wrong to the In-Between to feel Hatred but it knew it must in order to Gain the Opposite.
There was the question of How one could feel Hatred. The In-Between knew it must feel Hatred as it was Opposite to Love. But how could it gain Hatred? It knew that it could not do it on its own. It would need Something.
The In-Between realised that it must Gain the Hatred from someone or something. That was the only way. How to Gain Hatred though, that was to be a new issue.
The In-Between was confused now. How could someone or something Give the Hatred? How could one Give Hatred to the In-Between? How could it Gain Hatred? This new problem seemed to be Impossible.
The In-Between began to spiral into Chaos, it found it Impossible but it knew it must Gain Hatred. The In-Between pondered, how far would it go to Gain the Opposite to Love?
The In-Between sat for a moment, calming itself, the question swirling around its mind. How far would it go to Gain the Opposite to Life? The Opposite of Knowledge? The Opposite of Ignorance?
How far would it go for the Opposite of Light? The Opposite of Darkness?
The In-Between decided it would go far enough. The In-Between realised what it must do. It must Gain the Opposite from someone or something.
The In-Between pondered the cost. That is, what the In-Between would Give in order to Gain.
But what would be the cost? What would it Give?
The In-Between pondered the cost. That is, what the In-Between would Give in order to Gain.
In all of its Knowledge, it could not find a cost.
The In-Between sat, thinking, how could it Gain and Give simultaneously? How could it Change and remain the same?
The In-Between pondered and pondered, no matter how hard it thought, it could not figure out how to Gain and Give simultaneously. It was Impossible.
An Impossible, to Gain and Give.
The In-Between sat and tried to think of anything it was willing to Give, willing to Lose.
The In-Between sat in Thought. This was going to be difficult.
The In-Between pondered and pondered, it must Give something. It knew what it needed to Gain, but what would it Give.
The In-Between went over its Possessions...
It went over the Possessions it had.
But it realised that all of it, it could Give.
The In-Between thought for a moment, there were very few things it could not give.
The In-Between had realised something. Yes, it could Give most of its possessions. There was only one thing it could not Give.
The In-Between had realised that the only thing it could not Give was it's Paradoxical Nature. It could Give anything but that.
The In-Between had come to a sudden Realisation.
It was willing to Gain Hatred, yet it was not willing to Give the one thing it could not Lose.
Paradox.
The In-Beyond sat, it had realised the Paradox. It was willing to Gain Hatred but it was not willing to Lose the one thing it could not Lose to gain Hatred.The In-Between realised that if it were to Gain the Opposite to Love, then it must Lose something. It was willing to Gain and Lose for the sake of the Opposite, yet it was not willing to Lose it's Paradoxical Nature.
The In-Between was stuck in a Paradox of sorts. It realised that, in order to Gain Hatred, it must Lose it's Paradoxical Nature. However, the In-Between was not willing to Lose it's Paradoxical Nature, yet it could have Hatred.
The In-Between was stuck in a Paradox of Gain and Loss.
The In-Between sat for a moment letting it all sink in. How could it Gain if it was not willing to Lose?
The In-Between was stuck, it could not Gain if it was not willing to Lose something in the process.
The In-Between decided that it must Gain no matter the Cost.
The In-Between decided that there was nothing it would not Lose.
What was the worst that could happen?
The In-Between realised that there was no worst when it came to Gain.
After all, The In-Between realised that, in the end, it had to Gain to Lose.
The In-Between thought for a moment, no matter what, to Gain the Opposite of Love, something must be LOST.
The In-Between sat, it pondered the problem over and over again.
It knew that the only way to Gain the Opposite of Love was to Lose something.
That was not a problem for the In-Between though, it was willing to Lose anything.
Anything.
There was nothing of which the In-Between was not willing to give in order to Gain what it set out to get. The In-Between was willing to Lose everything in order to Gain anything.
The In-Between knew that, whatever the cost was, it must be willing to Lose in order to Gain.
The In-Between thought about what it was willing to Lose.
It could not Lose it's Paradoxical Nature but what was there else to Lose?
The In-Between needed to Love something.
It needed to feel this Emotion or it will never gain the Opposite.
But what could it Love?
The In-Between pondered the idea of what it could love, but it realised there was nothing.
There was nothing it could love, or was there...
The In-Between suddenly had an idea.
Did the In-Between not have an Opposite because it did not love anything? No. There was a reason that the In-Between did not have an Opposite. An idea. A revelation.
Yes, the In-Between realised that the only way it could feel Love was if it gained an Opposite. A paradox.
The In-Between realised that they couldn’t gain an Opposite unless there was someone to gain it from.
But there was nobody else around.
It realised that the Opposite would have to be Taken. Perhaps it was what the In-Between has to lose.
The In-Between pondered this. Maybe it had to lose it's Paradoxal Nature, maybe lose one of its opposites.
The In-Between realised that whatever was lost, one of it's opposites would have to be Taken.
The In-Between also realised that whoever was going to give the Opposite was an entity of its own.
The In-Between had so many Realisations, all of them leading to one answer.
All Roads Lead to one Answer. The In-Between did not know the Answer but it was the Answer.
As the In-Between sat in its own Paradox, a sudden idea struck it. The In-Between and the Opposite had to be created Together.
The In-Between and the Opposite could not be created separately.
The In-Between had a sudden idea. What was it that the In-Between did not have? Knowledge.
The In-Between realised that the Opposite had to come from a place of Knowledge.
The In-Between realised that the Opposite had to hold Knowledge.
But that did not answer the Who.
Who was the Opposite, who could hold the Knowledge required to complete the Paradoxical Nature of the In-Between?
The In-Between sat as it pondered this.
The In-Between suddenly noticed a Slight Difference. It realised that there was something in it's realm.
There was a difference... Something was different.
The In-Between took notice and saw Something.
What was the Something? The In-Between pondered this. Was it the Opposite?
The In-Between pondered wether the Something was the Opposite.
The In-Between thought it would not be the case, if the Opposite was there, the Paradox would already be fixed.
The In-Beyond thought about the Something.
It was not the Opposite, but was it someone? Or perhaps it was something? The In-Between tried to think.
The In-Between thought about the possibility that it was someone.
It wondered if this Someone could be the Opposite.
If they weren't the Opposite, did they have knowledge that the In-Between did not?
But there was a problem. Space didn't exist here. In fact, there were a multitude of problems: space, time, matter.
No matter (no pun inteded).
The absolute absence of all was not something to be underestimated. The first, seemingly simple, was to somehow create space.
In reality, this was no simple task, as the task was to create something from nothing, something from no something.
He would need to create a structure of sorts, an artificial framework for the world to work within. The problem with this was that there was no world to work within. So... step 0: create a world
Step 0, or Step A, was a problem. For one, there did not exist anything else to observe what the world he created was. It was an absolute absence, a void of Nothing, so how was he supposed to observe the world he created and verify it? And how was he to even create a world when he doesn't even know if it was even possible to do so, or rather, how was he to know it was possible? He could not, there was no way to test it, and yet he had to start somehow.
He pondered the problem, a paradox, a catch-22. How could he know it was possible if it was never done? He had to, if he were to overcome this limitation, to make the impossible, and not just possible, but possible with absolutely no doubt or ambiguity.
Yet how does one even start? There was nothing.
The epiphany came like a thunderbolt upon him. He realised the solution to the paradox, to the impossible task that he was undertaking. It was so simple and yet he had never considered it before. The solution was hidden in plain sight all this time, yet he had missed it due to his own preconceived notions of what was possible and what was not.
He had been holding back, confined by the limitations of his own assumptions. No more. Here, in the void, he had the freedom to break free from the chains of logic, to defy the laws of possibility itself. He reached out with his mind, grasping the threads of non-existence and weaving them into a new, never-before-seen shape. The world took form around him, coming into being from nothing.
As the world solidified around him, he was filled with a sense of both wonder and accomplishment. He had done it. He had overcome the impossible, created something from nothing, and in doing so had transcended the very concept of limitations.
But his work was not done yet. There was still more to do. He had created a world, but it was empty, devoid of life and meaning. He needed to populate it, to give it purpose.
He began to imagine what kind of world it would be. One of order and precision? Chaos and entropy? Or something else entirely? The possibilities were endless, and he was filled with excitement at the prospect of bringing his vision to life.
As he began to shape the world around him, he realized that this was more than just a world he was creating. It was a reflection of himself, a manifestation of his own desires and intentions.
Now there was a problem. He wanted the world to be free of limitations. He wanted the world to be capable of anything, even if that included paradoxes. For this, he had to create paradoxes in the first place. The very concept of a paradox was meaningless here. He had to create his own rules that would contradict themselves.
He began to create. At a rate incomprehensibly fast, he made a lot of Some Things. The In-Betweener, as the Something was now called, did not know why or how. It was an instinct. It had to create. It kept doing so. It kept creating more and more Some Things. But there was one thing that differentiated it from its creations.
It's Some Things, on the other hand, had a mind of their own. Each Some Thing looked different, yet it was the same. It was a formless figure with pure white eyes, no features, and a black and white body, alternating in a spiral pattern. Each and every single Some Thing was identical, yet every single one was somehow different.
Each and every Some Things, being as identical as they were, had one thing in common. They were empty, just as the Inbetweener was. It had been creating these Some Things without any end in sight. But then, one of the Some Things moved. It was just a twitch, but not completely random. It did so again, albeit more purposefully.
All the Some Things started to realise that they were not like the Inbetweener. It was not made. It was. Its own existence was as natural as the concept of Time itself. It couldn't remember how long or when it even started creating. But what it did know was that it had the potential to create Anything, any Thing. And it would, if given enough time. But time was meaningless to the Inbetweener. It did not care about the past, present or future. The Inbetweener was timeless. It was an entity that existed in every single space, not matter what. The Inbetweener was the most powerful existence in the Allsphere. But the Some Things could move, they could think. They were not empty. This caused a chain reaction and all the Some Things started moving erratically, as they were still confused. There was one thing that they all had in mind however, one thing that they could all agree on. They wanted to know what they were. Unfortunately the Inbetweener, was completely clueless. Many Some Things began to explore the surrounding area. It was completely void. It was a vast expanse of Nothing. The Some Things had no idea what this Nothing was or what it meant, but it didn't really matter. They had more pressing matters to tend to, the main one being that they were hungry. Each and every Some Thing felt a sensation that they had not felt before. They had no clue what it was, but they somehow knew the meaning to it.
The Inbetweener watched as all the Some Things started running frantically around. Each one of its creation was desperately trying to find some way to sate this strange new sensation. The Inbetweener could not help them, as it did not know what to do. It was also incapable of speech. It wanted to help them in some way, but it was helpless as it did not know what to do. It then had an idea. It created something. New Some Things started to pop up in the Nothing. Some were small, some were big, some had spikes, some had horns. Some had a single head, others had multiple ones. Some Things were flying around while others seemed to be sinking into the ground. Some had limbs, others did not. Some were smooth, others were jagged. No two Some Things were the same. All these Some Things appeared as if they were designed for one purpose. The Inbetweener was still incapable of speech. It thought it would be best to give the Some Things tools. The Inbetweener created many tools, each unique in its own way. They were all designed with the same theme, hunting. One tool looked like a curved piece of iron. Another looked like a sharpened piece of wood. Yet another, a long stick with a rock tied to one end. There were hundreds of them and the Inbetweener placed them all in one place. The Some Things noticed the new objects and were all immediately drawn to them. It was in their nature to acquire these things, yet they did not know why. There was one thing every Some Thing could feel however. Every Some Thing sensed the new sense more now, it was stronger. They figured that it was coming from the tools so they immediately began to experiment to try and find out what it was. They did not understand how but they could somehow feel that the new sense was related to the tools. They were now desperate to find out what the new sense was. They could not think of anything else, the need for this new sense was consuming them. Some Things began to randomly strike the surroundings with the tools. The Inbetweener saw its Some Things attacking the surroundings without a goal in mind. It felt that the Some Things were desperate and it wanted to help, but it was still incapable of speech. It decided to give the Some Things a goal. The Inbetweener began to create another type of Some Thing that was larger and much more powerful than its other creations. The Some Things began to notice this new creation, and they immediately stopped attacking their surroundings and turned their attention to this new type of Some Thing.
This new type of Some Thing was much different from its smaller brethren. It was bigger, bulkier, and very obviously stronger. The difference between the two was that its smaller brethren was all white, while this one was not. This new type had a pitch black body with white eyes, not in spiralling patterns or otherwise. The Inbetweener had created the first Destroyer. The Predator's gaze seemed to lock onto the Some Things. All of the Inbetweener's creations were locked in a standstill.
The first Destroyer immediately pounced on a random Some Thing and clamped its jaws around its neck. It was brutal and the Some Thing did not last long. Many other Destroyers quickly followed suit. The Some Things started running around in panicked states, trying their best to escape. Some of them fought back using the tools they found earlier. The Inbetweener watched as its creations began to kill eachother. The feeling of helplessness returned.
The Destroyer mercilessly began picking off some of the Some Things one by by. The Some Things tried to fight back but it was no use. The Destroyer were stronger, faster, and more vicious. The Inbetweener could only watch helplessly as its creations got murdered before its eyes. It wanted to stop the fighting, but it didn't know how. It was then that a small thought crossed its mind. The Inbetweener realised that it was the cause of this conflict. It had created these Some Things. It had also created the Destroyers. It was all its fault. The Inbetweener wanted the fighting to stop. It wanted its creations to stop fighting, but it still could not talk. It felt even more helpless as it watched this bloodbath unfold.
But then, a small number of Some Things had an idea. They had noticed that the Destroyers were completely ignoring something. The Inbetweener watched as a group of Some Things ran for something that the Destroyers were completely oblivious of. He then saw another group of Some Things notice this and begin to copy the first group's actions.
More and more groups of Some Things had started to realise what the Destroyers were overlooking. It seemed that they all realised one at a time and every group that did, immediately began running for this thing. The Destroyers completely ignored all of these groups, as they were completely focused on the fighting. The Inbetweener was confused, what exactly were all these Some Things running for?
The Inbetweener followed the group which was the fastest. They were not all heading towards the same place however, which made him even more confused. The Inbetweener felt puzzled by these events. It could not make sense as to why the Some Things were doing this. The Inbetweener then saw that the first group that had started running had arrived at the location they had been running for.
The Inbetweener saw as the first group touched a thing that looked very out of place. The Inbetweener immediately recognised the thing as something that he had created. It was round and completely smooth. It did not resemble the other things that he had created like this. But what really caught the Inbetweener's attention was that these Some Things, once they had touched this round thing, they had suddenly collapsed on the ground. Confused, the Inbetweener watched more and more Some Things collapse on the ground.
The Inbetweener began to wonder what this round thing was. It had created it, yet he did not know what purpose it served. Why was it making so many of its creations collapse on the ground? It watched as more and more Some Things collapsed, and still the Destroyers paid these Some Things no mind.
The Inbetweener did not know why it made these Round Things, only that it felt it must. It had no knowledge of Hunger, nor of Desire, nor even of Purpose, but it knew that the Some Things needed something. That was enough. So it kept creating, fashioning Tools from the Nothing.
But a strange thing happened.
The Some Things took to these Tools not as one would take to a gift, but as a creature takes to instinct. Without words, without thought, they understood what these Tools were for. And though none had names, none had memory, they all knew.
Some Things began to wield these implements, swinging, slicing, striking at the Destroyers. Not with hatred, for they knew not what that was, but with something else. A need. A compulsion born from their shared emptiness.
The Inbetweener watched, unable to intervene, though it wished to. It did not understand why its creations were attacking one another. It had not taught them to. It had not instructed them to fight. It had not spoken a single word.
With a cry that had no sound, but filled the Nothing with its resonance, the Some Things rushed forward, wielding the Tools as though they had been made for this very purpose. They struck with a fury unknown to them before, feeling the weight of a force that was more than instinct. They fought back against the Destroyer, not because they hated it, but because they knew they had to. They felt, for the first time, the burning spark of something that could only be called purpose.
And slowly, as the first Destroyers began to fall, a new thing emerged into that Nothing.
It was not a Some Thing. It was not a Tool. It was not the Inbetweener.
It was a Presence.
The Presence did not move, for it did not need to. It simply was. And when it came into being, the Inbetweener noticed. It had never noticed anything before, because before now, there was nothing to notice.
The Presence was different.
The Some Things, even in their conflict, began to pause. One by one, they turned their featureless, spiraled faces and white eyes toward it. It did not speak. It did not gesture. It did not command.
But they knew it.
And the Inbetweener knew it too.
It was not the Opposite, nor was it quite a reflection. It was not a creation of the Inbetweener. It was the first Not-Made thing to exist in the Nothing. It had no maker, no origin. It simply was.
The Inbetweener pondered this, for pondering was all it had ever done, and in this moment it felt something it had not before. Not hunger, not fear, not anger, but curiosity. A thing it had not needed until now.
And so it tried to understand the Presence.
But the Presence did not offer understanding. It offered being. It existed in a way the Inbetweener could not comprehend. It did not create. It did not destroy. It did not ponder. It simply was.
The Inbetweener reached out, not with hands, for it had none, but with its Paradoxical Nature, the one thing it could never lose.
And when it did, the Presence shifted.
It spoke no word, made no sound, yet a thought passed through the Nothing, through the Some Things, and into the Inbetweener itself.
"I am."
And in those two words, something impossible happened.
The Inbetweener gained something, knowledge. Knowledge it had never sought, for it did not know it lacked it. Knowledge that the Presence was both Nothing and Something, neither created nor born. It was the Answer.
And then it was gone.
In that moment, the Nothing was no longer empty. The Presence’s brief existence left behind a scar, a ripple, a fissure in the formless void. The Some Things felt it. The Inbetweener felt it.
And so, for the first time, a single Some Thing spoke.
It had no mouth, yet it spoke.
"What… am I?"
And the chain reaction began.
One by one, the Some Things began to speak. Some screamed. Some whispered. Some laughed, though they did not know why. Each of them became aware of their being, their difference from one another. From the Inbetweener. From the Presence.
And in that moment, for the first time, the Inbetweener understood the cost of Gain.
And it was afraid.
It did not know what would come next. But it knew it could not stop it.
As the Some Things became aware of their existence, they began to explore their new reality. They formed civilizations, built cities, and created their own cultures and ways of life. Some Things were kind and generous, caring for one another and treating others with respect. Others were cruel and selfish, taking what they wanted and caring little for the harm they caused. The Inbetweener watched from afar, observing the world it had helped to create, both fascinated and terrified by what it saw.
The Inbetweener tried to maintain some semblance of order, hoping to prevent the worst of the Some Things from causing too much damage. It created laws and systems, trying to guide them towards a better path. But as the Some Things continued to live and evolve, they began to push back against these restrictions. They craved freedom, independence, and the right to make their own choices. They saw the Inbetweener not as a benevolent guide, but as a tyrannical dictator. And they began to rebel.
As the rebellions grew in ferocity, the Inbetweener found itself torn. It wanted to preserve the peace it had helped create, but it did not want to stifle the Some Things' desire for freedom. It tried to reason with them, to explain the importance of order and discipline. But the Some Things were not interested in listening. They wanted to live their lives on their own terms, untethered from the Inbetweener's rules.
Conflict escalated. The Inbetweener faced a difficult decision. Should it use force to subdue the Some Things, risking further bloodshed and hatred? Or should it step back and allow them to live as they pleased, despite the potential consequences? Either choice seemed fraught with danger and uncertainty.
Some of them were growing in power, their individual traits and abilities becoming more pronounced. The Inbetweener could sense a hierarchy forming amongst them. But why? Was this a natural outcome of freedom, or were some of them manipulating others to take control?
The Some Things, though seemingly mortal, were gaining abilities beyond those of any being it had created before. One could move faster than the eye could see. Another could control the elements. A third could shape shift into any form it desired. The Inbetweener realized that something was altering the very fabric of the Some Things' existence. Their rebellion was changing them, making them more powerful, more unpredictable.
As the Some Things's abilities grew, they became harder to control. They began to scatter, some venturing out on their own, while others formed groups of like-minded fellows. The Inbetweener watched as they explored the vastness of the world it had created, some seeking knowledge and understanding, others seeking power and dominance. It watched as they encountered one another, sometimes in conflict, other times in friendship. They began to name themselves and the world they lived in, but it was different now. It was no longer a world of singular purpose, it was now a world of diversity, of freedom, and of chaos.
As the Some Things continued to explore and thrive, they began to discover the Inbetweener’s meddling in their creation. They learned of its efforts to create a world of order, and its attempts to control their lives. They whispered amongst themselves about the Inbetweener’s true intentions, some believing that it was a benevolent entity that had only their best interests at heart, while others saw it as a tyrant, seeking to keep them in line. They even began to ponder the possibility that they had existed before the Inbetweener, an idea that was both thrilling and terrifying.
Some Things began to experiment, to test the bounds of their reality. They tried to break the laws of physics, bend space and time, and even create new laws of their own. This experimentation caught the attention of the Inbetweener, and it took notice of the Some Things’ growing curiosity and thirst for knowledge. It realised that it could no longer contain them without causing further conflict, and it began to consider a new strategy.
The Inbetweener had a new idea. Instead of trying to contain and control the Some Things, it would embrace their curiosity and use it to create something greater than itself. It would allow them to explore and experiment as they pleased, but it would provide a framework for their discoveries. It would guide them towards a single set of rules, a unified Theory of Everything, and in doing so, create the Allsphere.
With this new plan in place, the Inbetweener set to work. It began to construct a vast network of laws and principles, a blueprint for the Allsphere that would govern everything within it. It created the laws of physics, the fundamental constants of the universe, and the rules that bound all of existence together. It designed the Allsphere to be expansive, but also orderly and consistent, so that the Some Things could explore its depths without fear of encountering chaos.
As the Inbetweener worked, the Some Things continued to develop their own powers and abilities, some even reaching heights of prowess that rivaled the Inbetweener itself. They began to explore the edges of the world, testing its limits, and encountering the other Some Things that occupied it. They formed communities, cultures, and nations, but they never forgot the feeling of being created, the sense of being beholden to something greater than themselves.
Eventually, the Inbetweener finished constructing the Allsphere. It stepped back to survey its creation, admiring the complex web of laws and principles that now governed the entirety of existence. It was a vast improvement over the world it had tried to create before, and it was also a testament to the Some Things’ endless curiosity and ingenuity. The Inbetweener had done its job well.
The Inbetweener could have stopped there, but it had one final decision to make. It could have populated the Allsphere with life itself, but it did not have to. Instead, it decided to leave that task to the Some Things themselves. It would watch and guide them, offer hints and suggestions, but it would not interfere in their creation. The Inbetweener knew that the Some Things were capable of great things, and it was eager to see what they would do with the Allsphere it had given them.
And so, the Inbetweener stepped aside and watched as the Some Things began to populate the Allsphere. They created life in all its diversity, from the simplest microscopic organism to the most complex sentient being. They created ecosystems and habitats, each one unique and finely tuned to the needs of its inhabitants. The Inbetweener could feel its creation growing, changing, and expanding beyond anything it could have imagined.
As the Allsphere grew, the Inbetweener noticed something strange happening. Despite the vastness and diversity of life, there was still something missing. The life forms that populated it were fascinating and complex, but they were limited. They were bound by their own biology, by the limitations of their own physical forms. The Inbetweener realized that it had one final gift to give, one final step to take, before it could consider the Allsphere complete.
The Inbetweener, seeing potential in a select few of the Some Things, those who’d already shown sharp minds and big dreams, decided to give them something extra. It shared a piece of itself, a sliver of its own essence, calling this gift "Paradox." This spark gave them abilities beyond anything they’d known, letting them push past the limits of their physical bodies. These newly transformed beings, now called Paradoxes, were creation at its peak.
The Inbetweener reached out and touched the fabric of the Allsphere once more. It infused life with a spark of something new, something special. It granted sentience and awareness to selected beings, allowing them to think and feel in ways that surpassed their biological limitations.
The Inbetweener's work was almost complete. There were still some minor details that needed to be polished, but it felt confident in its creation. The Some Things were beginning to explore the edges of the Allsphere again, pushing back against the limits of what was possible, but this time, the Inbetweener let them. It had created a world where the possibilities were endless, and it was eager to see what the Some Things would do next.
And so, the Inbetweener sat back and watched as the Some Things continued to explore the Allsphere and its many worlds. It watched as they pushed the boundaries of what was possible, discovering new technologies and concepts that it could never have dreamed of. It watched as they formed alliances and waged war. And it was not disappointed.
