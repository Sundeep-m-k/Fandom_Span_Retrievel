The HSpace
is the place where people who dislike H or like G go, similarly to the
Broccoliverse
. For people to be sent to the HSpace, they must mentally dislike H, or like G, so only saying or typing "I hate H" won't bring them to the HSpace, however if they say or type something bad about H or good about G and mentally think H is bad or G is good, they get sent there. There is also a cooldown of punishment; if their punishment ended and they get brought back to their home planet and they don't like H or like G, they have 1 month cooldown before they get punished again. Unlike the Broccoliverse, people who are sent to the HSpace usually don't have permanent sentences, except if they hated H or loved G multiple times. The people who dislike H or like G are called Haters. Children cannot be brought to the HSpace.
The
laws
in this place are the same as in our Universe, as only living beings with physics similar to our Universe get sent there.

Very weird situations that happened in the HSpace
Structure
[
]
The HSpace is a black sphere, with a red H on the four entry points, and a gray line connecting the four entry points. The entry points are the place where it is possible to escape the HSpace, but it is guarded by very powerful white guards (called huards), that are probably stronger than
Sentient Ball That Eats Universes
, but weaker than
Sentient Triangle Which Destroys Multiverses
. While inside the HSpace, people who hate H start to like H more, and dislike G more. This is to prevent people who leave the HSpace immeadiately getting brought back into the HSpace.
Hazia
[
]
Main article:
Hazia
For the lower-level Haters, they reside in Hazia, a planet, however when communicating they aren't allowed to use the letter G (if they do, they get a bit harsher punishment). Because they have free time, they can do mostly whatever they like, for example play games, drive expensive (in Earth) cars, and go to work, if they want to.
Murdering someone or commiting other crimes mostly the same level as murdering is forbidden, and will lower their reputation by two
.
If your punishment was in Hazia, not counting the cells, you will get a magic device that has a button after you leave the HSpace. If someone press the button, the user will be teleported to where they last left Hazia after one second, and they can teleport again after pressing the button. If the button is pressed by someone that has never gone to the HSpace, or was last left in Hea or in Hazian cells, nothing will happen.
Cities
[
]
There are lots of cities in Hazia. The main city, Harnia, is where low-level Haters get sent to. However, there are many other smaller cities and towns.
Cells
[
]
For higher-level Haters, or criminals of Hazia, they reside in cells. The lower-level cells are located in Hazia, in the main city where people are brought to. The higher level cells are located in Hea, Hazia's moon. Cells in Hazia have a play area, where it is possible to play sports like soccer, football and basketball. In Hea cells however, there is no play area. Cells, both in Hazia and Hea, are white.
Reputation and punishments
[
]
Reputation
[
]
There is a reputation system in the HSpace, and they determine your punishment. The reputation of someone can be calculated by:
H
[
]
Loving H: +2
Liking H: +1
Neutral: 0
Disliking H: -2
Hating H: -4
G
[
]
Loving G: -2
Liking G: -1
Neutral: 0
Disliking G: 1
HatIng G: 2
This means that if you love H and G, your reputation will be 0, so you won't get one. If you dislike H and love G, your reputation will be -2+-2, or -4
Punishments
[
]
If your reputation is lower than 0, you will get sent to the HSpace and get punsihed according to your reputation. The reputation of an individual is lowered by one if they try to escape or damage the HSpace or it's planets.

.
Very weird situations that happened in the HSpace
[
]
23/5/2017: SCP-682 entered the HSpace and caused some of destruction. It's reputation was -5, because he hated H and liked G. This was very unexpected, because it was presuemd that the HSpace only brings people. Because 682 is very hard to kill, the huards needed to contain it. 682 tried to escape the HSpace lots of times. The  Broccoliverse Servers said that 682 is too dangerous for the Broccoliverse, so they put 682 in a Hea cell seprarate to the main cell structure.
