IS-1079 is one of the gaps that exist between the regions some
Metaverses
, and Specifically on MET-54 and it existence is not confirmed 100%, it is 50% a theory, though. Some Metaverses can have this gates between their regions, it simplifies the exchange of teleporting
Multiverses
from a region to region.
How it works
[
]
An Exemple
Imagine a region M-a and another M-b there is a thing like a wormhole or mostly a slot for simplify more, it has it own spacetime, the slot is 5d because itâ€™s inside a Metaverse, and the Multiverses are 4d, so what happen when two dimensions meets? The time stops and get backwards and the multiverses get hotter and teleport to the other side in a very low time, also it increases the speed of teleporting. Regions exchange multiverses just as cities exchange goods via trucks. Rarely it causes the destruction of multiverses. WIP
