Um, we should ask
THE CREATOR

The
Metareality Web
/
Reality Cluster
is a web ofÂ our local realities.
The box
, the
Omniverse
, and the
Primordialverse
, which are connected by the
Metareality Core
, are central to the web. Each reality has at least one existence state.
If you are within the void of the Web, then you will disappear; you aren't connected to any realities, which hold existence states together, so you don't have a valid existence state. You can phase through anything now, as you can't interact properly with existences without an existence state. You can't even see anything.
Things larger than this (Such as
The Pencil
) do not literally 'exist' outside of it (in terms of
Glitchy999's Hierarchy
at least) but are sort of a 'metaphysical' link between one state of being and another higher one.
