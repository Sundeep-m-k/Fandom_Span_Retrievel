A
Spaghettiverse
is a verse containing all forms of spaghetti(any way) and even forms of spaghetti that never even existed at all, Spaghettiverses are contained by noodleverses and sometimes edibleverses, this is generally the safest verse to live in since no one expects their target to be in a pot of cosmic spaghetti, and it's a great verse to vacation, it has nice spaghetti skies, spaghetti beaches, spaghetti anything tbh, and the plate is made of a unknown thing stronger than literal
sarpy Particles
but soft and flexible.
a Spaghettiverse is a great place to travel so if you wanna go to a vacation, be in a Spaghettiverse!
