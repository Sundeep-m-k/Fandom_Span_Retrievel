About
[
]
The
Destroyer
is THE reason of a
verse
's collapse. It is a
being
without existence, and all existence is at it's command of collapse and destruction.
Power feats
[
]
The Destroyer is able to instantly crush our
Box
and many others with its mere existence.
It can tear
Structures Of Everything
into nothing with no effort.
Breaking
Barriers of Quantulum Quintox
with barely any struggle is something it can do.
Only the
Creator
is powerful enough to even scratch the non-being of ultra-violent power and invincibility by itself.
The
Creator
and
Him
are the only reason the Destroyer does not cause eternal carnage and cause the collapse of all, even the one of the
Infinite Madness
and others, excluding Him, the Creator, and the Destroyer itself.
The Destroyer can't die and can defeat all but Him and the Creator. The Destroyer almost matches the power of either being, but is slightly weaker than the two overall.
The Infinite Madness is no match for the Destroyer as it would be killed without even hurting the latter. Other entities, such as the Beings Of Chaos,
Box Opener
,
Kraa
,
Kriplin
,
Kreplin
, the
Manipulator
,
Googolploxio
,
HIMSELF
,
Kevin
, the Archangel, Guardians, Omegon, the Logic, and the Technolords combined would be no match for the Destroyer either.
Quantum Criminals are able to hold off the Destroyer for a long while (a few transfinite years in fact), but then would finally get clobbered by the latter.
The Destroyer is more powerful than
Delimangur
.
If we, in some way, are able of destroying it, it won't really matter, as it regenerates in

Etc.
Other facts
[
]
The Destroyer hates everything, except for Delimangur and the
Voidances
. The Destroyer hates, but respects it's master, which is the unknown
ruler
of all, even Him. The Destroyer's main goal is to destroy (at least one of)
a
Void
and every last
Omniverse
that exists.
