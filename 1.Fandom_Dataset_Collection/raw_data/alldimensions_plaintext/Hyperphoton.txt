A Hyperphoton is a much more powerful photon. They can only be produced by incredibly high energies, but the thing is there is no limit to how much they can be charged. Their speed also depends on their energy.
The more energy a Hyperphoton has, the faster it is.
Hyperphotons can be contained upon creation, but once it is created, only an infinitely powerful being or object, like the mysterious center of an
Ochaverse
can stop it. Depending on the opacity of whatever it’s going through, it will send back x amount of information. Then, the camera will decode it.
Usually, Hyperphoton cameras are used to take photos of giant verses, usually by Kardashev > 24 civilizations. If you have seen a photo of a verse that is over decillions of ly large, chances are Hyperphotons were used.
Hyperphotons do not affect humans, since they are unstoppable, they are in
effect
massles, but we don’t know if they actually are massless. They are also invisible unless viewed by a Hyperphoton Camera, as the information is only virtual information that travels in a precise beam. Therefore, multiple Hyperphoton Cameras can take photos of one scene.
