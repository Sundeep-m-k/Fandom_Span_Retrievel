Hegg
, short for Heck Egg, is a food-based verse in the
Foodverse
which has a large amount of prominence, as it is the only object the Foodverse contains that can be considered another verse.
It has a shape resembling that of an egg, with a very thick shell of stone-like material that seems to be 40% calcium and 60% very heat-resistant rock. Emphasis on heat-resistance, as every lightyear in increases the temperature by roughly 879F.
Entities from all over like to brag about their lightyears into Hegg, with one of the more well-known entities and rulers being Frankensweet, almost 36/60 LY into Hegg without melting.
The boiling plasma and in the cooler regions gas starts out at 500F by just touching the rock, and about 1200F at the very beginning of the inside of Hegg. It is said to taste like various accounts of rotting food. These factors are where the Heck part of Heck Egg comes from.
At the very center, the yolk is said to be the heaviest thing that isn't a black hole, barely outdoing Neutron Stars.
