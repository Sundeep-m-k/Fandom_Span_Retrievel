The
Anti-Concept
is a particle with a negative amount of properties. Nearly no information about the physical appearance of Anti-Concepts is known, but any particle or verse with 0 properties contains Anti-Concepts, and also any particle or verse with a paradoxical property. This includes
·
and by extension the
Xeyon
.
Negative properties
[
]
The hardest part to understand about the Anti-Concept is that it has a negative number of properties (in fact, the Anti-Concept has exactly -1). Most particles have an extremely large number of properties (is a particle, is a concept, is smaller than a
Box
, is smaller than an
Omniverse
, is contained within a Box, ...), however the smallest of particles seem to have nearly none. This is because the Anti-Concept balances out most of its
positive properties
(the ones we can see and describe) with its
negative properties
, which are impossible for to describe. The Anti-Concepts are the largest possible particle with negative properties, and it has been proven to be the largest.
The number of positive and negative properties in the Anti-Concepts balance out to -1, making it a building block for other particles to have less properties than it seems they should. To think of it another way, · has 0 properties, the
Xeyons
describe those properties, and the Anti-Concepts are what make · have 0 properties in the first place. Because of this, the Anti-Concepts can help prevent paradoxes.
Negative properties can be measured by measuring the amount of energy it emits. For particles smaller than
Blueprint Particles
, there exists a very small energy emission exactly proportional to the net of properties it has (called one Protojoule or PtJ). ⬤'s emission is 1 PtJ, and · emits 0 J, hence it has 0 working properties.
Discovery
[
]
The Anti-Concepts were first a theoretical particle that explained how ·s can have 0 properties, while that in itself is a property. A maximum size for an Anti-Concept was proven, which was smaller than both a Xeyon or a
Forcer
.
The existence of Anti-Concepts still remained theoretical for 1.5
OYC
until new advancements were able to detect a new negative property being inside a ·. This proved the existence of the Anti-Concepts, and was deemed to be a new particle.
