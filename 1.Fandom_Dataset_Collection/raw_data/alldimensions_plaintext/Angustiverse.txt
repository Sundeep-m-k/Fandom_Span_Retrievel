The
Angustiverse
is the epicenter of energy of a
Groupverse
, And is located at the center of the fractalized structure making it up. The prefix "Angusti-" means 'Narrow' or 'Horn' in Latin, because their is so much energy flowing into the
Angustiverse
that it starts to infinitely stretch it down. This verse is what the
Groupverse
gets it's energy from, and also stores the energy so the
Groupverse
doesn't explode. This verse is primarily made up of extremely energized
⬤
and
Primordium Phi
.
