A Meowverse is created when the electromagnetic spectrum goes beyond infinity and ultimately evolves into CAT WAVES which are so powerful they make Ultraviolet and Gamma and X rays look like Radio waves, these cat waves can clash with each other and depending on how many cat waves, they can make different types of meowverses (This is How Meowthurthbloxxerath Made his realm), Cats are very cute btw.
