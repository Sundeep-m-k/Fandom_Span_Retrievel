About
[
]
The
Infinibooks
are very special
verses
, as they're responsible of containing everything that has happened since the dawn of time.
Appearance
[
]
Infinibooks have a quite simple design, being book-shaped structures. The more
Epic NGLverses
they hold, the more "pages" they have.
Color variants
[
]
They usually are red (such as the one seen in the infobox), but instances of Infinibooks having colors such as blue, green, etc. aren't rare either.
More uncommon variants can even reach monochromatic color schemes!
Protection
[
]
These "books" have many interesting properties and features, along with being one of the most important and heavily-guarded verses in
All Dimensions
Wiki
. The Epic NGLverses on the outside of the "books", however, are less guarded if they are not extremely important. They litter the cover like inhabited dust, more or less.
Inhabitants
[
]
The Infinibooks usually have many
creatures
and entities residing inside of it. The table below lists some of the more notable entities found within the Infinibooks from our local
Garage
, although there are so many different types that it's impossible to properly find and name them all.

Description
Harmful to their Infinibook?
Writer Bug
IB-001
Writer bugs spray ink onto the pages of the "books", writing letters, which form words, phrases, sentences, and so on. They can move and write incredibly fast. They are some of the most intelligent bugs and are very skilled writers.
No
Soldier Bug
IB-002
Soldier bugs are much bigger and more powerful than other bugs. These bugs tasked with guarding the Infinibooks. If a foreign entity comes too close to one, they'll swarm and destroy it.
No
Resource Bugs
IB-003
Resource bugs venture outside of the Infinibook in order to gather and hunt for food and resources. They are very fast, although not quite as fast as the Writer Bugs.
No
Exterminator Bugs
IB-004
Exterminator bugs reside inside of the Infinibooks, searching and hunting for harmful local pests such as word termites.
No
Overseer Bug
IB-005
The overseer bugs are the leader of the other types, and are tasked with ruling over the Infinibooks and giving orders to the other bugs. The overseer bugs' location is usually unknown.
No
Word Termites
IB-006
Word termites chew and eat the pages of the Infinibooks, and are very annoying along with being harmful to these verses. They are sought out and killed by Exterminator Bugs.
Yes
Inksquitoes
IB-007
Inksquitoes feed on ink, similar to how mosquitoes feed on blood. This will cause letters and words to fade over time, and eventually disappear entirely.
Yes
Properties
[
]
Whenever something is written in an Infinibook, it also affects their entire local Garage. For example, if a writer bugs chose to write "the
Blue Rings
are conquered by the
Red Rings
Cults and collapses," the Blue Rings within that Garage would collapse. Of course, the actual writing of the bugs would be much more detailed than this simplified example. The pages of the "books" describe everything in incredible detail. The "books" are incredibly difficult, if not impossible to be read by any unenlightened individual.
The "books" can be edited as well, and when they are, they change their course of history. The writer bugs, if they desired to, could erase entire verses out of history, even the ones above the Infinibooks themselves. These two properties could easily be abused if they fell into the wrong hands, which is why these verses are so heavily guarded. The act of editing the Infinibooks has been used in the past by the writer bugs in desperate situations. There have been rumors of whole verses being wiped out in an instant. However, again, the writer bugs will only do this when absolutely necessary, and they need the permission of an overseer bug to do it.
The words of the "books" have special properties themselves. They are able to be used for teleportation purposes. For example, if an entity came across the words "
Obice Novissimo
" and jumped into them, they would be transported to a copy of the aforementioned location. This is a very useful for resource bugs, as they can quickly transport themselves to locations that have resources to gather or or creatures to hunt.
Outside the Infinibooks
[
]
Unfortunately, some things are just too powerful to be documented. Entities and verses that are powerful or enlightened enough will not be able to be written in the Infinibooks without causing instability. If the Infinibooks become unstable, they'll begin to eject letters, words, even leading up to whole pages and chapters if the "books" become unstable enough. This is incredibly dangerous, as this event can wipe countless entities and verses out of existence.
In a particularly serious incident, nearly 10% of an entire Infinibook within our local Garage was ejected and had to be repaired. Luckily, that Infinibook is incredibly powerful, so
nearly
everything can be written on it, and there's no reason to reference entities and verses that an Infinibook cannot handle.
Sequels?
[
]
A question that one might have is that if the Infinibooks dictate what happens to almost everything, what dictates what happens to things that are too powerful for even the Infinibooks? Some say that they may have an even bigger, more enlightened and more powerful sequel. However, if this is true, we haven't been able to detect it with our current technology. As we discover larger and larger verses, we may find the second type of Infinibook one day.
