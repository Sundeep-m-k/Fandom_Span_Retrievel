Introduction
[
]
The
All-Spiral
are humongous structures containing
All-verses
. They're made up of
Ħ
All-Verses. Around each All-Verse, there is a huge sphere about 3 All-Verses in diameter that is where if you escape, there is a extreme force pushing you with Ħ times the power of getting pushed by an average human. Only 2 civilizations in our local
All-Sphere
escaped this and survived, with the cost of roughly half their population.
Parts of an All-Spiral
[
]
The Center
[
]
The Center is an area close to the center of an All-Spiral. Only .4% of All-Verses exist here. The reason is the extreme heat and force of gravity, making this hard for All-Verses to survive.
The Spirals
[
]
The spirals are the “arms” of an All-Spiral. 25.6% of All-Verses exist here. They turn around the center, at Ħ MPH. It is mostly calm here, with the occasional collision of All-Verses, most of the time destroying 10 All-Verses and creating 20 more a few Femtillion years later.
The Voids
[
]
The Voids are a place between the arms where All-Verses float around. 53% of All-Verses exist here, and most of the time their created from leftover All-Verse dust coming from the arms to the Voids.
The Border
[
]
The Border is the last part of the All-Spirals, and has 21% of the All-Verses. The All-Verses here are crammed together in certain groups of a few 10^584 Picillion^12 Femtillion All-Verses. That also makes it more likely for All-Verses here to collide, resulting in a bunch of huge explosions that destroy a few million All-Verses but create more.
The All-Spirals are always expanding, so the parts will always be bigger.
