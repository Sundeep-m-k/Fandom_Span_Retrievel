Gravity in the Negaverse
[
]
The
Negaverse
has very strong gravity but it somehow doesn't make black holes, this could be due to the high
voidity
of the Negaverse (0.785) which doesn't cause everything to collapse into black holes, others say that there is an undiscovered particle in the universe that prevents all of the black holes from appearing.
