It's just a local group of Barrels and its size is... too large.
It can sometimes be considered an altarca, or an object that contains a large number of objects, but in the general sense, it is a series of barrels that continues in all directions. Due to the recursive nature of barrel containment, multiple Barrelplexes form a
The Barrelplock.

Story
[
]
There were 2 barrels, however, there were paths leading to 2 different cetaverses. The problem? Too many barrels on that path. A guy deleted the path, and the barrels floated to the cetaverses, found a box and a cloning machine, and, well..
After the creation of a very large quantity of barrels, it became too much to handle for the guy. Fortunately, someone came and stopped the expansion by jamming a couple of wrenches in between the barrels. Some of these wrenches can still be found today, but others have been removed due to inconveniences caused by inconsistencies in the barrel surface.
