Properties
[
]
Unlike
the Cubinders
, The Tessinder is static and does not rotate, or at least it rotates extremely slowly (at 10 meters per second). The following photo shows a cross-section of The Tessinder, showing an object similar to The Cubinder. The other portion of the photo shows five lines, two of them curved. This is the second portion of The Tessinder, sometimes called 'the lines'. Leads to somewhere unknown.
