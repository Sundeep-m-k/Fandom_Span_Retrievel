ATSL strings are
WAY
more fragile than every single
ATSL elemen
tary particles
[
2
]
. They are raveled up in a skinny bundle in order to increase stability, but this does limit the string's vibration somewhat, reducing the number of possible particles. As a result of this, the only particles ATSL elementary particles can produce are absolutely tiny electrons, up quarks, and down quarks.

Strings are tiny, tiny strips of energy purely kept by the shield created on their own:
ATSL elementary
particles
. that "shield" is the only thing interacting with an outside world and anything inside it cannot affect anything of the outside world. Except affecting strings at the middle of that "shield" particle.
Since ATSL elementary particles can be filled with
a lot
of energy
[
3
]
before exploding into horrible explosions capable of destroying nearby verses, a gigantic amount of energy is accumulated inside particles. the energy concentrates at the border of elementary particles, and kind of builds a little "ocean" of energy below the particle's boundary.
This ocean is not a normal, liquid ocean with mass, but it is a dangerous one built from crazy energy particles keeping their positions due to truly
insane centri
fugal force
. However, this fragile ocean gets deeper each time ATSL elementary particle absorbs energy. when the ocean gets
deep enough to re
ach the center string
...
⌬ATSL Str
ing
can
do any
thing!
[
]
...Of course, absolutely, purely theoretically. The vibration of the ring is almost as almighty as
sha
ggy
, able to produce anything according to its vibration. From the nonexistent existing particles to post-
bo
x
objects, given the right vibration, ATSL strings can excite space to any shape.
Oh, and the limit of objects ATSL strings is not necessarily objects; it can form imaginary concepts such as space with different rules than others! And remember... all of those can be done with a single fragile stripe of energy, that breaks in a single touch

[

. Property of Fuzzy area lets anything pass through it, and usual physics rule among all ATSL-string-formed Fuzzy area is that anything entering it is (approximately) half-converted to energy.  So, if you have one very small ATSL-string-formed Fuzzy area inside icosahedron fish bowl at your home, and you are not afraid to throw a chair into it...

well this is ATSL strings' creations
↑
Actually
a lot
more
than that
↑
And also remember, most of useful things ATSL string can produce requires vibration speed
beyond
infinity
, meaning you almost need to grind whole
ceta
verse
, or unusually energetic
bo
x
, or even
Probabilistic The
Box Supercluster
to produce something really useful out of ATSL string.
↑
Also ALSO remember that ATSL strings are more fragile than how much you think it is
↑
oh yeah the perfect lie marketing lol
↑
(n(1 or 0, 1 means "yes" and 0 is opposite),n,n)=(has physics laws, has nature, has boundary)
↑
Possibly harming, because
particle made fr
om ATSL strings
are insanely dangerous space-mines.
↑
These huge ATSL elementary particles are formed by vibrating string expanding to radius imcomparable to normal cousins of itself. And they tend to explode easily, so we won't have any time to research it anyway, before our universe explodes with infinite energy.
↑
Reminder: Fuzzy area is a region in space with only physics rule, without verse border or any objects.
↑
yes, the right choice
↑
such as activeness, average&total energy level, density of inner objects, brightness, ... , ... , ....
↑
unique space without a border: Fuzzy area... like said above / LNB: (1,0,0) unique space with a border: verse / LNB: (1,1,1) unique space with a border interacting with world: Structures / LNB: (1,1,2)
↑
verses formed from ATSL strings have unusually thin border, and it works just fine below this size.
