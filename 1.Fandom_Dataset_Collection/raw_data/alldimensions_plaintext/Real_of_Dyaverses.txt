Dyaverses
The Dyaverse cluster or The Realm of Dyaverses. I messed up the name it is Realm of Dyaverses. This page will also be short
Universes
[
]
The Realm of Dyaverses is home to 10^11 Dyaverses. The realm of Dyaverses is around 10^21 light years. The more farther you travel in the realm the more distorted everything gets most Dyaverses start losing their purple color and start changing colors and get. Once entering the edge of the cluster everything will start glitching out.
Structure
[
]
The  Dyaverse cluster makes a massive rectangle shape that seems to start with purple and starts changing colors and starts glitching near the end. At the very end it starts changing colors dramatically before turning into TV static.
