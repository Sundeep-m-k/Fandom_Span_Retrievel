The simulated dimension is a dimension that is part of the
π-verse
. This dimension is twice as big as the multiverse. It is a dimension that exists in an infinite space-time cycle, based on a scientific theoretical concept. There is first a virtual world containing intelligent beings, but not enough to know that they are in a simulation. And the creators of this simulation are also in a virtual world, and not knowing it either. And the creators of this other simulation are also in a simulation, and are even smarter than their creations, living in the simulation. This cycle continues infinitely, even more intelligent being that create the simulation.
But then there must be a beginning and an end in this matrix, which extends into the infinity of the virtual universe. In reality, there isn't, nor is there any way to escape the simulation. However, there is a way to infiltrate it. The entrance is located exactly between the end of the multiverse, and the beginning of the π-verse. Between these two dimensions there is a great concentration of atoms, neutrons, electrons, negative and positive force, and dark matter energy. This energy, in sufficient quantity, can create, every 1000 years, a dimensional portal.
But if the creator beings of each simulation, themselves living in a virtual simulation, become more and more intelligent, there should be a being with infinite intelligence and consciousness, so would be able to escape. There is precisely a civilization of beings with incredible intelligence without any limit, capable of escaping from the virtual world. However, they do not decide because they are equipped with wisdom that prevents them from doing so. Each simulation is different from the other simulations, and therefore contains approximately thousands of billions of other dimensions, this number growing each second of time in the universe.
