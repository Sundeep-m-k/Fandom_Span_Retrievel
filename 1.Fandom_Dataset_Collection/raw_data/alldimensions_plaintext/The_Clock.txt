The three main Hchezic void lords resting in the Corridor of Alebo-Ashewan (Jgep - left, Rathjau - middle, Konrtibn - right)
The Clock
is a
finality-based hyperstructure
built by the
Hchezics
. The date of conception is unknown, thought to have been anywhere from
10,000,00
to
20,000,000
OYC
ago.
This would make it not only an ancient structure, but also the largest of its time.
The Clock
itself is theorized to serve as a container of immense size, as well as a perfect time keeping device.
All inferior verses are kept inside of its heart,
the total center, surrounded by a yellow - brown metallic substance
, the make-up of which is still unknown. The heart itself, and the visible clock as well, makes up only a
tiny portion of the whole structure
, which consists of chaotic metallic pipes shooting in
seemingly random directions, splitting off into random amounts and never ending, continuously becoming thinner and more numerous.
As one ventures out far enough, the web of pillars becomes too convoluted  to navigate through, eventually filling out the 0th and negative dimensions
entirely.
This is where the brutalist architecture comes to an abrupt end.
Any attempts of getting out are stopped by a thin wall.
Venturing past this wall can be achieved through Interdimensional Teleportation or by puncturing the wall, the latter is
slightly
more difficult though.
The true purpose of
The Clock
is
still up to debate
. The official files created by the
Hchezics
have been
annihilated along with the entire civilization
. The most accepted theory today, is that it serves as a shrine of testament to the
56 Hchezic void lords
(Jgep, Rathjau and Konrtibn are the most known to historians, they can be seen on the second image of the infobox)
. This hyperstructure, however, was the final task by the followers. An eternity of
Alebo-Ashewan
worship and to one day lay upon it, served as a mind and soul numbing promise that kept everybody in check.
Where to, and how the
Hchezics
disappeared, is completely unknown.
