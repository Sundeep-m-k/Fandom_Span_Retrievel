The
Masƣpⱷuȵaverse
, or
UNI-1.34 x 10
1733
, is a
Universe
directly contained by the
Hendaverse
HENDA-1
[

]
. It is unknown how it was transported to the Hendaverse directly, as there are no signs of it being artificially transported, and it getting to where it is naturally is an impossibility.

Due to not being contained by a
Multiverse
,
Megaverse
,
Metaverse
, etc, the Masƣpⱷuȵaverse has very few laws, and is very chaotic. It is not as chaotic to be unstable, though it is still chaotic enough to be almost unlivable.
Oasis
[
]
The most habitable region of the Masƣpⱷuȵaverse is the planet of Oasis. Underground scoping of Oasis has revealed the planet to be partially composed of many random materials, as well as
Lawium
, most at the core, which keeps Oasis stable, but not as stable as most things. Oasis has no moons or other satellites, and could be considered a rogue planet. There are no other locations like Oasis in the Masƣpⱷuȵaverse.
Due to the highly sought-afterness of Lawium, the planet is partially protected from people looking for Lawium and other unauthorized people.
On Oasis, there lives an entire ecosystem of creatures accustomed to the partial instability, with some using it to their advantage. For obvious reasons, they are planetbound, being unable to escape the planet without external help.
Formation hypothesis: "So unstable it restabilizes!"
[
]
This hypothesis for the formation of Oasis consists of the following:
The Masƣpⱷuȵaverse is very chaotic, being able to form almost anything, usually only lasting for a few seconds
Theoretically, it could form a stability-keeper, like
Lawium
.
From a 'stability field' formed by the
Lawium
, many other otherwise unstable materials could be made stable.
These stable materials and Lawium could coalesce into a planet, in a 'normal' way, forming Oasis.
By random chance, life and other things to live could form on Oasis.
The Lawium keeps Oasis stable and from becoming chaotic.
