History
[
]
For the understanding of the
Tyàtian
Empire
, we need to understand
Tyàts
' history.
The first key
species
to develop was the square species, a species with only eyes, but can speak or hear. They also don't
really
have DNA. Even though they are only 4mm thick, they also have a non-euclidian space and are very powerful.
Tyàts' conquest
[
]
In 1671 EY (Earth Years), Treeversians landed on Tyàts. They made several colonies, with the first one being
Tiaba
(note: there is no "b" in the Tyàmeẁ language, however there is in the Treeversian's language).
The empire was made by the
country
of Hìqèpya ([çyqæ̃pja]), after warring many other Treeversian countries in the continent of Sìmnya ([syɴja]). It renamed itself to MèqTyàtsosz Waqarì in 1921 EY, after it conquered the last Treeversian country in Sìmnya.
Downfall
[
]
In 1954 EY, they made the fatal mistake of warring Galeszà ([ɢaʎeʃɑ]), which had a population of 8% squares. This was enough to defeat the entirety of the Tyàtian-Empirian army, and in 1955, the empire split into the original countries.
Peak of the Tyàtian's empire. Conquered territory is marked in red.
Species Apperance, Culture and Flag
[
]
They looked like Treeversian humans (normal,
earth
ling
humans
). Their flag was a recolored flag of Rondônia, Brazil, however, it wasn't based on it and didn't even know Rondônia or Earth existed at all.
