Layers
[
]
Nebulon void
[
]
The outermost layer is sometimes known as the edge or the Nebulon void, it's a dense cloud of matter surrounding the main
Nebulon bubble
.
Outer Nebulon bubble
[
]
The outer layer is a thin layer of a
Nebulon bubble
. It is already way denser than the Nebulon void. From this point, you are considered to be inside the Nebulon bubble itself and not just its surroundings.
Inner Nebulon bubble
[
]
The Inner Nebulon Bubble is the innermost layer of a
Nebulon bubble
.
Entering and exiting
[
]
Entering a Nebulon bubble is like trying to enter a brown dwarf star. It's possible, but hard.
