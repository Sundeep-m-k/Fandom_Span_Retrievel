What is the Eternality of All Verses?
TENOAV is a ‘verse’? No, the way to think about is just like a giant… eternal. Basically, TENOAV is an eternal… thing. As you may have guessed, it is eternal. Everything about TENOAV is eternal. It is eternal (it cannot die), it takes an eternity to get to it, to leave it, and time is warped so badly, not just infinitely much, but so much that any duration of time, process, event, event instant, is eternal.
TENOAV’s size is described by Ω
מin
(☒☒☒
Ω
)
, and this time, ☒☒☒ in Metafinities means eternally more, so basically, there is nothing that can describe it except eternity. The ranks of Eternity don’t really matter at this point, as everything is meaningless. This is basically the meaningless notation.
After that, as said in is the Divergentality of All Verses (
TDOAV
), symbolised by ☒
4
, each next tier of four ☒☒☒☒ diverging from the normal… anything. However, this number is so far away that even the OAV Growth Function cannot keep up. Thus, the next number is The Duality of All Verses (
TDUOAV
).
All space, reality, reason, meaning and time in TENOAV is replaced with eternal. TENOAV is so eternal that moving in any direction or doing anything is meaningless, as you can only move forward in time, but time is replaced with just… eternal, so time effectively runs backward, for all you know.
Have fun!
