The
Yellowmarkersverse
is a yellow marker-shaped verse that contains all of YellowMarker's verses, with some exceptions.
The Yellowmarkersverse does not contain any of his verses contained by another verse explicitly.
This means that the Yellowmarkersverse contains the
Cranberrycupverse
, the
A cat in a treeverse
, the
Paradoxverse
, and the
Countingverse
. The
Paradoxverse
in fact contains itself, but the self-containment of the Paradoxverse is located in the Paradoxverse. The other verses have nothing special in terms of containment, and are contained as they are.
