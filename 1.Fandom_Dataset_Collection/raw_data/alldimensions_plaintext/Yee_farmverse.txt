According to the laws of physics in our Universe, a whole verse dedicated to farming is impossible.
It would have too much gravity and explode
It wouldn't actually grow things
It would look like a peanut
However, some guy named John was fiddling around with the
Jdsjsdnfjrsjdbdbdjsndmkeskmdsk telescope
and accidentally found this. He found a farm verse, even though that was considered impossible.
The entities in this verse are human-like and will do anything to protect their crops. They have a strong sense of community and work together to ensure successful harvests each year.
Structure
[
]
This verse has a bunch of farm lines, that go around in lines around. The lines get smaller and smaller as you go perpendicular to the lines until you get to the end where you have crop circles. Sometimes there is a cow in the crop circle. Sometimes there is frickin dirt
The Alleged John Story
[
]
As John continued to study this verse, he discovered something even more surprising. The gravity in this verse was not like anything he had ever seen before. Instead of pulling things down, it seemed to push them up. Plants grew towards the sky instead of the ground, and the cows could jump over the crops with ease.
John was amazed. This verse defied all of the laws of physics he knew, but it still seemed to function perfectly. He kept studying it, hoping to uncover its secrets and learn how it was possible.
As he studied, he began to realize that the entities in this verse had a deep connection to the land. They didn't just grow crops, they nurtured them. They treated the soil with care and respect, and in return, the land provided them with an abundance of food.
John had never seen anything like it. This verse was a testament to the power of community and the importance of taking care of the planet we call home.
And as he continued to study it, he couldn't help but wonder if there were other verses out there, waiting to be discovered. Verses that defied the laws of physics and showed us new possibilities for how we can live and thrive.
John became obsessed with studying this farm verse and its unique properties. He discovered that the entities in this verse didn't just cultivate crops, they also utilized advanced technology to help them sustain their way of life.
The buildings in their farm communities were designed to harness the power of the gravitationally-inverted planet, and to keep the crops growing towards the sky. The entities had also developed methods of conservation and recycling, ensuring that nothing went to waste and everything was used to its full potential.
As John continued to explore this farm verse, he began to see the potential for it to revolutionize agriculture on his home planet. He shared his findings with other scientists and experts in the field, and they too were amazed by what they saw.
Together, they began to explore ways of applying the principles of the farm verse to their own world. They began to develop new technologies and methods for sustainable farming, utilizing the power of gravity and prioritizing conservation and preservation of the land.
The discovery of this farm verse had opened up a whole new world of possibilities, not just for agriculture, but for the ways in which we interact with and care for our planet. John continued to study this verse in depth, hoping to uncover even more secrets and unlock the full potential of this incredible discovery.
Thanks to his passion and dedication, John became known as a pioneer in the field of sustainable agriculture. His research and innovations led to the development of new farming practices that allowed his home planet to produce more food with less impact on the environment.
John's legacy continued long after his passing, as his discoveries and ideas inspired future generations to continue exploring and learning about the mysteries of the universe. The farm verse served not only as a source of knowledge and inspiration, but also as a reminder of the importance of looking beyond our own world and striving to understand the beauty and complexity of the universe we inhabit.
His name is Billy the Humongous. His task is to collect crops from his farm. He has one fridge dedicated to storing all the crops he has collected. He has been nominated as one of the hardest and dedicated workers in the Yee Farmverse.
A Dark Turn
[
]
John's obsession with the farm verse had taken a dark turn. He had become consumed with studying the strange entities and their advanced technologies, and the more he learned, the more he realized just how dangerous their world really was.
The buildings in their farm communities weren't designed to harness the power of the inverted planet, but rather to trap and control the entities that lived there. The crops weren't growing towards the sky, but rather towards the entities' own twisted and mutated forms, as they consumed and absorbed the nutrients of the soil and air around them.
John's research had driven him to madness, and he began to experiment on his own crops and livestock, using the same techniques and technologies he had learned from the farm verse. These practices resulted in horrific mutations and deformities, as the creatures he created grew to monstrous proportions and developed unnatural abilities.
As John's experiments grew more and more out of control, he became a pariah in the scientific community, and his name became synonymous with madness and horror. The legacy of his research was one of darkness and death, as the mutations he created continued to proliferate and spread throughout the planet.
The farm verse, once held up as a marvel of technological and agricultural advancement, became a symbol of fear and dread, as people feared what other horrors lay hidden within its hidden depths. The legacy of John's madness and obsession would haunt the planet for generations to come, a warning of the dangers of delving too deeply into the unknown.
