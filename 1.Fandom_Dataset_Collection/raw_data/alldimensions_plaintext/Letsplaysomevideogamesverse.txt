Now we have yet another object verse. It is kind of weird that these are all inside each other since they have completely different purposes.
This verse is used to play video games. It has a bunch of different types of video games of every genre. However, it doesn't use any electricity. The way this verse works is that they have weird magnets which act as force which moves the stellar objects in this verse, making this verse not rot your brain.
The games in this verse are very entertaining. This verse is very popular with at least 7 billion visitors per year. Even though this verse doesn't really have any practical use, it still is an entertaining masterpieceÂ :)
