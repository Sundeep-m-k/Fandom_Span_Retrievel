Were you looking for
All Dimensions Wiki
, the page about the wiki itself?
This
cosmos
is the setting of most of the
All Dimensions Wiki
. Each cosmos is the home of everything created in its dedicated cosmology wiki (except the cosmoses). Outside of these cosmoses, there are true nothingness. Everything created in a cosmology wiki cannot contain the cosmos or be created outside of the dedicated wiki's cosmos. Some cosmic entities, however, can escape the home cosmos and even enter a foreign cosmos.

Each
cosmos
is divided into two sections: The Canon (who has a canon rank of 1 or 1#x) and Non-Canon (who has a canon rank of 0 or 0#x) divisions. It has a law that all the All Dimensions Wiki things have to follow. The
cosmos
has an absurdly strong, instant regenerating invisible barrier to prevent everything from escaping this wiki and to separate canon things from non-canon things so they don't affect each other.

Canon Rank
[
]
The canon rank has three values, two of which have an x modifier:
2: Both canon and non-canon at the same time in all wikis about cosmology. All
transcandent omni-gods
have this canon rank.
1#x: Canon in that wiki. Wiki things that have a page but do not have a canon rank are always considered canon in that wiki. If you set the canon rank to 1 and it was created in this wiki, it becomes 1#0.
0#x: Non-canon in that wiki. Wiki things that do not have a page and are put in a non-canon thing are considered non-canon in that wiki. If you set the canon rank to 0 and it was created in this wiki, it becomes 0#0.
x (currently) only has five values:
0: All Dimensions Wiki
1: Beyond Universe Wiki
2: Fuzzo's Cosmology Wiki
3: Ultimas Cosmology Wiki (Technically named Cosmoverse)
4: Verse and Dimensions Wiki
If you see a thing that has a canon rank set to anything else that's not mentioned in this section, it is a virus that must be deleted.
How to port to other cosmoses
[
]
Step 1: Wait for the administrator-bureaucrat's approval
[
]
Ask the administrator-bureaucrat if you can port the verse you want to port to their wiki. If none of the administrator-bureaucrats are active, then don't bother asking them, because it will take days, months, or even years to get their approval. Instead, ask the most active admin. If they reject your request, you can either give up or try to comply with the other administrator-bureaucrats.
Step 2: Make an abridged version
[
]
Now it's time to port the verse you want to port. Copy the page and paste it to the other wiki. Shorten it so that it won't look like a copy of a verse, and don't forget to link it to the main page. Afterwards, wait for one day to make sure the administrator-bureaucreat REALLY accepts your request.
Step 3: Done!
[
]
If the verse is not deleted or the administrator-bureaucrat doesn't state that it will be deleted, you're done! Now you can make a story that has a connection between one
cosmos
and another
cosmos
! Don't forget to update the canon rank.

What's missing?
This is probably the only End-All-Be-All EpicAlexisMaxwell has ever created.
The ability to move from cosmos to cosmos was first demonstrated by the
cosmicialverse gods
.
This was the fifth EpicAlexisMaxwell article ever created, and the fourth oldest EpicAlexisMaxwell article that survived.
