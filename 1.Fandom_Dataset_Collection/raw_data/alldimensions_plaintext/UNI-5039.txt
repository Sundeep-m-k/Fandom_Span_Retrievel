UNI-5039
[
]
UNI-5039 is known to be the closest
universe
to our own, at 1.1 trillion light-years from it. It is part of the
Local Universe Group
. UNI-5039 is home to over 2000 known civilizations, with the most advanced one being a 3.4 on the Kardashev scale. It is about 43 billion years old. It has almost 8 trillion galaxies, 1 sextillion stars, and 936 octillion planets. Its name comes from it being the 5,039th Universe documented by
humans
, but was the first explored by humans. The reason it was discovered so late was due to the positioning of UNI-5039 and the telescopes used to detect Universes. UNI-5039 was almost impossible to see on the planets where the telescopes were put, but eventually it was found after they decided to put one on one of the other planets.
Formation
[
]
This Universe was formed 43 billion years ago. It had its own big bang, due to the high concentration of matter in the
Inertio Supernebula
(which also created
our Universe
and
UNI-3
), and  it expanded a lot. After cooling down and expanding more, it became the universe that is there today. It will die out in a 100 trillion years, when all matter in this universe will die.
Civilizations
[
]
There are over 2000 known civilizations in this Universe, so I wonâ€™t name all of them.
The most common civilizations are a type 0.2, with only one civilization being a 3.4. The 3.4 civilization is known as the
Tuhis
(Too-is) and are so advanced I literally cannot explain it other than they rule over multiple
galaxies
. Fortunately, they know not to interact with humans as humans almost wiped out half their species in a war.

UNI-5039 contains multiple structures, including
MILI-1
. It contains about 32 million
Superclusters
, 3
Milliverses
and 531
Microverses
. The amount of
Nanoverses
are unknown, due to the 2-dimensionality that they have, which makes them able to exist in areas humans aren't able to explore, such as inside black holes, stars, and 2-dimensional spatial pockets in reality.
