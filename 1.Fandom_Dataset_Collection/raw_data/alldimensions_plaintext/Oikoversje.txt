An oikoversje (oiko (household) + verse (container) + je (small)) is the largest possible contained area in a
xenoversje
that has its own physics. An oikoversje typically contains several
universjes
within and on its border which as a result causes some
universjes
to have multiple physics at once.
Like all versjes, oikoversje have an infinite amount of properties and any oikoversje's properties will be that of our own unless otherwise specified.

An oikoversje's physics is based on which false vacuum state it is currently in, and it is called its "Vacuum State Physics Type" (or P-type for short). Oikoversjes with true vacuum states are usually not very interesting as they are not complex enough to form anything.
At the boundaries of oikoversjes, physics changes. What happens when you cross these boundaries depends entirely on the physics of either side, but usually these physics are incompatible with eachother so you will be destroyed if you try to cross it.
The physics boundary of an oikoverse can shrink and grow by the process of false vacuum decay. Whether the border shrinks or grows depends on which oikoverse has a vacuum state with a lower energy.
Emergent properties
[

Oikoversjes are large enough to be able to have emergent properties form.
One of these emergent properties is the curvature of space; as the scale becomes larger, imperfections in the shape of space may grow large enough to have a noticeable effect on the curvature of space, making it slightly hyperbolic or spherical, causing parallel lines to diverge or converge at these scales.
On really rare occasions, space may become so curved that it touches itself at different points. This causes a sort of "boundary" that either divides or encloses an area of space. On this boundary, leakage occurs where particles are ejected into other spatial dimensions, colliding with other particles, causing a chain reaction of leakage. This does not cause many problems though, as the scale of the boundaries are very large and they are very rare.
Because most oikoversjes are so big they are homogeneous and interaction between particles happens on a very large time scale so some properties of particles such as velocity don't need to be kept track of.
how is this contained in the omniverse?

the omniverse contains everything that exists and therefore there are substances that are liquid space. When this element interacts with space, it makes it not liquid, but just as fluid and superfluid.Â  Even ultra fluidity is open . It makes certain zones of higher dimension than others and with super-fluidity, absolutely indentical Oikoversje come out.
