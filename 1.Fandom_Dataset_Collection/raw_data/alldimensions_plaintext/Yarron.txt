Gimmicks
Gimmick 1
Smaller than itself.
Gimmick 2
Each Yarron has a gupervoid at their center.
Gimmick 3
there is no gimmick 3.
Yarrons are incredibly small particles, even being smaller than
Nothings
themselves.
Structure
[
]
Every yarron has a
gupervoid
on their center, which are purely conceptual in nature and, due to their size, are extremely "viscous", since it would be very, very hard to fill a gupervoid by even a fraction.
Yarrons also appear to spin, producing something similar to energy on their own, though energy is a concept and structures below
non conceptual verses
cant have them. They all spin at the same rat, so if one yarron completes a rotation, all other will have as well. No yarrons have been observed to not spin at all.
History
[
]
Most of their information is known from the texts of an extremely old, advanced civilization. We don't know how it was destroyed, as it was far more advanced and powerful than all others at the time, so no one else was a threat. It's speculated that some sort of fundamental calamity destroyed it at the roots instead. As such, most of this article's information is based entirely off of those texts, like the image.
