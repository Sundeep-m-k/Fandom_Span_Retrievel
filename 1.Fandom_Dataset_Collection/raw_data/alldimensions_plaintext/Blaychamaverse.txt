The
Blaychamaverse
is a large verse suspended by a chain on the roof of the
Absoverse
.
When a disturbance is cause by outside forces, it rings a great sound that
echoes throughout existance and space
. It acts as a bell, a caution for life to
evacuate into safety when strange beings attack
.
Its purpose has been
crucial
for the eternity it has been existent, in the wars of
170 OYC
,
703 OYC
,
1880 OYC
and
2405 OYC
.
It is the
main alarm that conveys what is about to come
. It is composed out of
extremely massive material
, causing its bashes and sounds to become exceptionally strong, more than expected.
