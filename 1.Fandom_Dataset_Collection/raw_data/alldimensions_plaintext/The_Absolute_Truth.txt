The Absolute Truth
is the truth of truth of truth... etc for a while. It is able to be confirmed as so truthful due to it being a digitally-based verse within
The Pentagonal Hexacontahedron
, storing all the data of truths within a very small fraction of its space, using centary code to store it in a central component the size of about 700 Absolute Tetrahedrons' worth of data on every atom within these spaces. It takes multiple
OYC
centuries' worth of scrolling with the fastest mouse and AI to get past the data of the first Absolute Tetrahedron. And scrolling with the bar isn't and option, it's far to thin to click. It was created by

The way the data is stored also makes reading it much harder then seeing the physical form, it's kind of the thing about raw, digital information. You need a computer the size of the ENTIRETY of an absolute truth to get this data out. And it's constantly updating with reality, another annoying feature in deciphering it. You can get small parts of specific data bits though. One time, an empire used it to keep a different nation at bay by reading their current information.
Little center bit aside, The Absolute Truth is stored within computers in the rooms on the planets of The Pentagonal Hexacontahedron.
