The
Ultimate Reality
is a collective of looped realities that represent the stack of fictional realities. Each fictional reality is called a Metaloop. Metaloops function similarly to
Loops
and
Superloops
, but Metaloops are far bigger as they loop all objects up to the final
Meta-Class 4
object. The Ultimate Reality has helped when it comes to researching objects far, far smaller than the loops. In order to contain The Ultimate Reality, one must be beyond fictional stack itself.
The Fictional Stack Explained
[
]
Imagine a show you watch, these characters are fictional. We'll call this show A. Then imagine a show these characters watch, which we'll call B. Them imagine us as ᚠ. B is fictional to A, and so is A to ᚠ. Then imagine a show that B watches, which we'll call C. Then imagine another show C watches, going downward infinitely! Then imagine a world that sees ᚠ as fiction, and then one sees that world as fiction, going upward infinitely! That is the fictional stack.
