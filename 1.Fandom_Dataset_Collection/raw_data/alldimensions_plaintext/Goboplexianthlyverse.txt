Voids
[
]
There are many
voids
in this type of verse. A suspect of the generation of these voids of our Goboplexianthlyverse are some genetic glitches of the True Last Final Godplexianthly accidentally created when our
Alphasm
was creating him, which lead to some problems when the True Last Final Godplexianthly was creating this verse.
These verses also sometimes are one of the loneliest places in their entire
First Realms
, at times containing only 1
Universe
per θ
Transcendent Omniverse
sizes.
Colors
[
]
The colors exist due to the weird nature of these verses. Reasons of this are:
XYZ coordinate coloring glitching out into another formula
Radiation from whatever lies in the void of the void
[REDACTED]
The tree of expansion
There are other reasons, but these are the major ones.
