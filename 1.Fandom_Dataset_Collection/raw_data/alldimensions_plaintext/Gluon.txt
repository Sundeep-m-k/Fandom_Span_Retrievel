A
gluon
(/ˈɡluːɒn/ GLOO-on) is an
elementary particle
that acts as the exchange particle (or gauge boson) for the strong force between
quarks
. It is analogous to the exchange of
photons
in the electromagnetic force between two charged particles. Gluons bind quarks together, forming hadrons such as
protons
and
neutrons
.
Gluons are vector gauge
bosons
that mediate strong interactions of
quarks
in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Gluons themselves carry the color charge of the strong interaction. This is unlike the
photon
, which mediates the electromagnetic interaction but lacks an electric charge. Gluons therefore participate in the strong interaction in addition to mediating it, making QCD significantly harder to analyze than quantum electrodynamics (QED).
