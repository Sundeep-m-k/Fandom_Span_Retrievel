The
Surpassing index
of any concept or object (A) goes as follows:
Increase cases
[
]
if A surpasses another which has a SI of
n
{\displaystyle n}
, then A has an SI of
n
+
1
{\displaystyle n+1}
.
chains have a start SI (SSI) and an end SI (ESI), the end SI depends on the length of the chain, the SI of each verse is an interval between the SSI and the ESI, the SI of a chain specifically is represented by
R
a
n
(
S
S
I
,
E
S
I
)
{\displaystyle Ran(SSI,ESI)}
if A surpasses a chain, with the chainâ€™s ESI being
n
{\displaystyle n}
, the same as Increase case #1 happens.
the SI increases based on the difficulty of surpassing A
Non-Increase cases

berry paradoxes don't effect the SI of a verse or object
