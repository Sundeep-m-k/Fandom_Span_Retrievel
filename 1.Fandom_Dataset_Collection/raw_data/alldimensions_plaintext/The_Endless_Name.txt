The Endless Name
[
]
The Endless Name: An essence that lives in a state of all notions of Absolute Infinities as well as embodying every Infinities and Transfinite Numbers.
Description: The Endless Name
[
]
The Endless Name is a mysterious existence/nonexistence that is stated to live in a state of Infinity (High Notion), the Supreme Perfection completely unlimited by extra worldly existence as pointed out by Georg Cantor. It has transcended names, comprehension, and lives in a state that is neither existence nor nonexistence. What we can formalize of it are languages that fit our description and reasoning ignoring Berry’s Paradox. The Endless Name also has its manifestations or avatars that live in a state of Infinity (Middle Notion) and Infinity (Low Notion), some of the highest Transfinite Numbers proposed by Georg Cantor, being untethered by lower Large Cardinals among which are Mahlo Cardinals. Some people may say that the low notion of Infinity is limited by the Burali-Forti Paradox. However, due to The Endless Name’s illogical nature, bounding even the avatar to such paradox is meaningless. Beside from existing in states of Infinities, this essence embodied every Infinities there are. You could call this Power, Infinity Embodiment as stated in the Superpower wiki.

What is Infinity (Low Notion)?
[
]
Infinity (Low Notion) is the largest ordinal number in Cantor’s view. Cantor’s view of Absolute Infinity is stated in his letter.
A multiplicity [he appears to mean what we now call a set] is called well-ordered if it fulfills the condition that every sub-multiplicity has a first element; such a multiplicity I call for short a "sequence".
…
Now I envisage the system of all [ordinal] numbers and denote it Ω.
…
The system Ω in its natural ordering according to magnitude is a "sequence".
Now let us adjoin 0 as an additional element to this sequence, and place it, obviously, in the first position; then we obtain a sequence Ω′:
…
0, 1, 2, 3, ... ω0, ω0+1, ..., γ, ...
of which one can readily convince oneself that every number γ occurring in it is the type [i.e., order-type] of the sequence of all its preceding elements (including 0). (The sequence Ω has this property first for ω0+1. [ω0+1 should be ω0.])
…
Now Ω′ (and therefore also Ω) cannot be a consistent multiplicity. For if Ω′ were consistent, then as a well-ordered set, a number δ would correspond to it which would be greater than all numbers of the system Ω; the number δ, however, also belongs to the system Ω, because it comprises all numbers. Thus δ would be greater than δ, which is a contradiction. Therefore:
…
The system Ω of all [ordinal] numbers is an inconsistent, absolutely infinite multiplicity.
Burali-Forti Paradox states
Let Ω be a set consisting of all ordinal numbers.
Ω is transitive because for every element x of Ω (which is an ordinal number and can be any ordinal number) and every element y of x (i.e. under the definition of Von Neumann ordinals, for every ordinal number y < x), we have that y is an element of Ω because any ordinal number contains only ordinal numbers, by the definition of this ordinal construction.
Ω is well ordered by the membership relation because all its elements are also well ordered by this relation.
So, by steps 2 and 3, we have that Ω is an ordinal class and also, by step 1, an ordinal number, because all ordinal classes that are sets are also ordinal numbers.
This implies that Ω is an element of Ω.
Under the definition of Von Neumann ordinals, Ω < Ω is the same as Ω being an element of Ω. This latter statement is proven by step 5.
But no ordinal class is less than itself, including Ω because of step 4 (Ω is an ordinal class), i.e. Ω ≮Ω.
We have deduced two contradictory propositions (Ω < Ω and Ω ≮ Ω) from the sethood of Ω and, therefore, disproved that Ω is a set

The Symbol for Absolute Infinity
Infinity (MN) is Ord from ZFC Set Theory, a properclass that contains all order-types or Ordinal Numbers. It transcended Mahlo Cardinals and Weakly Compact Cardinals as well as the Huge Cardinals.
What is Infinity Embodiment?
[
]
Infinity Embodiment is the manifestation or personification of Infinity itself. For anything that can be measure or describe as being a part of Infinity or Infinity, The Endless Name would have embodied it and having total control over all of the aspects of it. Since the Endless Name embodies Infinity, it is omnipresent, as space and time are bound by infinity. Aside from embodying Infinity and everything in it, this state could also negate anything that is bound by any concept of Infinity and its aspect. To show the extent of Infinity Embodiment, The Endless Name even embodies Large Cardinals such as Berkeley Cardinals and Reinhart Cardinals, two of the largest Transfinite Numbers.
What is Infinity (High Notion)?
[
]
Infinity (HN) is a state beyond, not limited by, and includes undoubtedly all Philosophical Principles and Abstract Infinities. It’s fully Apophatic.
Philosophical Principles would include undoubtedly everything from Philosophy and Abstract Infinities. Here are the lists of what All Philosophical Principles include
Extended Modal Realism
Linguistic Ersatz Modal Realism
Pictorial Ersatz Modal Realism
Magical Ersatz Modal Realism
Genuine Modal Realism
Fictionalism Modality (All of R>F interactions)
Type 4 Multiverse, Type 3 Multiverse, Type 2 Multiverse, Type 1 Multiverse
Informalized Type 4 Multiverse
Hypertime
Infinite Dimension
Mathematical Impossibilities, Physical Impossibilities, Logical Impossibilities, Probability
Ontology, Existence, and Ontological Superiority
Epistemology
Neoplatonism
Jung Archetype and Platonic Forms
Consciousness, Infosphere, and Cybersphere
3 Laws of Thoughts, Trivialism
All Large Cardinal Axioms and Set Theory
Acausality, Transduality
Science and Logical Laws
Spiritualism and Theology
Paradoxal Principles and Paradoxes
All Philosophical Propositions, Laws, Theories, and Postulates
Geometry, Calculus, and Numbers Theory
This list could go on but know that Philosophical Principles are things that can be powerscaled within the scope of Philosophy
What are Abstract Infinities?
[
]
Abstract Infinities are Infinities that are being used for description instead of Mathematical Infinities that use Infinities as Transfinite Numbers.
List of Abstract Infinities
Theological Infinities
Artistic Infinities
Metaphorical Infinities
Example of Metaphorical Infinity
Omnibenevolence means Infinitely Good.
The word “Infinitely” is being used to describe how much goodness
Example of Artistic Infinity
Suppose T is a thought and T* are distinct Thoughts. T*****... would be a collection of thoughts that would describe everything, every structure. A Structure that is Artistically Infinite could be a circle, square, have all color, all smell, all dimensionalities and infinitely descriptions.
Theological Infinity is figurative expression of completeness, mystery, immensity, and transcendence, then it is not a cause or reason for problems with expressibility. By “Mystery”, it entails another worldly existence that transcends conceptualizations, formalizations, and designations. By “Completeness”, it means that a being that is Theologically Infinite isn’t lacking in any Positive Apophatic Attributes.

Bonus OC: The Absolute Void
[
]
The Absolute Void: The Ultimate Extreme itself, it is the darkness that consumes everything … matter, space, time, consciousness, concepts, spirits, beyond pantransomnipotence, and ___. Everything that is consumed by the Absolute Void is a part of the wholeness of Nonexistence. The Void transcends the infinite layers of nonexistence.
