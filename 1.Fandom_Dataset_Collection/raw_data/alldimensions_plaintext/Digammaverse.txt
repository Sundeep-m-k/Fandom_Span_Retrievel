The
Digammaverse
is verse packed with "
number particles
". These particles are represented by numbers, each coresponding to a property. The size of each particle is 1 picometer.
The full list of properties: mass, charge, spin, lifetime, speed, acceleratio, magnetic field, weak isospin, weak hypercharge, angle, interaction, color charge, chirality, parity, c parity and isospin.
Each particle has a
unique
set of numbers, there are
no
replicas.
This means that there are ~8.488*10
298
particles, which makes the
Digammaverse
~5.4475*10
79
light years in diameter.
