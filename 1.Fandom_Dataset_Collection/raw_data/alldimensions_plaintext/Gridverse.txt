Different laws of physics
The Gridverse is a verse separated into a "grid" of areas. Each one of these areas, dubbed Physic Areas, have different laws and physics.
Although some Gridverses' Physic Areas are visibly different from each other, most Gridverses have areas which look about the same. These Gridverses are much more dangerous due to this.
The amount of Physic Areas in a Gridverse is usually somewhere between 57 to 184 depending on the size of the Gridverse. Larger Gridverses usually have fewer but larger areas, while smaller Gridverses have more but smaller areas. Due to this, smaller Gridverses are more dangerous than larger ones.
Civilizations which start out in a Gridverse usually die out once they unlock interstellar travel, as the Physics Areas make it nigh impossible to travel long distances. For the civilizations that do survive, they are usually confined to a specific area and are relatively basic.
