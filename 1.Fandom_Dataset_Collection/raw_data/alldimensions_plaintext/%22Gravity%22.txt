Gravity
is the god of friction and his namesake, which is gravity.
He is bound to a prison engineered by
Space
. Gravity is occupied with the thought of escape; these obsessions constitute symptoms of insanity. (His prison is 17 rings big, or about 1.95
TIME’s
big, and his ring actually count as himself, so while
Space
tried to make a inescapable prison for him, it actually made him stronger)
