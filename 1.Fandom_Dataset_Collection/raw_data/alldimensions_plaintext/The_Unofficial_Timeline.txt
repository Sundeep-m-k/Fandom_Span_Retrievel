c. -ƒ OYC: The beginning of everything from this wiki. The first thing was created as a concept of everything.
c. -ƒ + 1 / ƒ
2
OYC: The concepts of conceptualization, abstraction, and logics were created.
c. -ƒ + 1 / ƒ OYC: Mathematical and physical logic were created.
c. -ƒ + Ω / ƒ OYC:
Variety Perimeter
was created as an measurement of everythingness.
c. -ƒ + Ω / ƒ + 1 / ƒ OYC: The first particles,
Protoparticles
, were created. They were
·s
at the lowest possible level of Archreality.
c. -ƒ + Ω
2

.
c. -ƒ + Ω
2
/ ƒ OYC + Ω / ƒ OYC: ·s and ⬤s has been transformed to form the first
Blueprint Particles
, although they are still Protoparticles.
c. -ƒ + 2 Ω
2
/ ƒ OYC: The first
Archreality
has been defined with Protoparticles.
c. -ƒ + 1 / Ω OYC: Protoparticles managed to generate a · from their own Superreality place. Every 1 / ƒ OYC, another layer is created.
c. -ƒ + 2 / Ω OYC: That · has been reproduced, and then quickly produced every 1 / Ω OYC after that,
c. -ƒ + 3 / Ω OYC: The first
Inane
has been created.
