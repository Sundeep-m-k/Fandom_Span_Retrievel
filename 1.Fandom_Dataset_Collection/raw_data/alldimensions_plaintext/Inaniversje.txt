An
inaniversje
(inanis (empty) +
verse
(container) + je (small)) is a large field of non existence with the potential for existence.
Veritaversjes
are created here.
Like all metaversjes, they're abstractions of reality and not actually things that are contionally existant.

Properties
[
]
Time
[
]
Inaniversjes generate their potential for existence by having an infinite amount of time and randomness, which together create the possibility for anything to appear.
When a random time in an inaniversje is taken, there is a 100% chance nothing existing will be present.
Non-existence
[
]
Inaniversjes are mostly made up of a lack of existence, or non-existence. This non-existence does not have the ability to form things like time and space.
Containment

Veritaversjes
[
]
Given infinite time and probability, which inaniversjes have, a veritaversje will form and will be perpetuated by
fortuatomtjes
at their core. Each of them shapes their core's randomness into a different form, though it usually doesnt have enough complexity for life to form.
Entities
[
]
Divine
entities
roam the inaniversjes. They are a byproduct of the properties of inaniversjes, being that there is infinite possibility for anything to appear, and there is only non existence which only divine entities or veritaversjes can survive direct exposure to.
These divine entities roam inaniversjes, contributing the creation of most of the more complex, life-harboring veritaversjes and becoming their gods.

These places have a huge role in shaping time and space, as well as
existence(s)
. Technically, we can say that these verses are the creators of everything that is below than
times and realities
