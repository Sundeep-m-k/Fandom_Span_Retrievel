Blueprint Particles
Nullirotos
are a more common kind of primary
Protospatial Particles
, which occupy nonexistence. Residing with
Protoverses
, they occupy space but can't interact with normal physics. They are commonly found in
the Other Box
and
Le Jorino Areas
, which mostly resides in the
Cetaverse
.
It is constructed by the same way as Protoverses. However, the only difference between these two is
existence blueprint particles
, which Nullirotos occupy greener existence-0 particles. In the other hand, they have same composition of 12 and same icosahedral structure.
They seem to have waves interacting between existence and nonexistence, acting like a force field against
chaos particles
. Important, they can let physical properties accelerate. In normal spacetime, however, is dangerous as it is incomprehensible and indescribable, as it is Nothing. These waves are interacted with particles having
Acic Fields
uncommonly, and are used to exchange constructive properties between existence ranks.
