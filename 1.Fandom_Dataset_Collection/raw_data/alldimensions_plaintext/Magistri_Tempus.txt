The Restart
[
]
The Collapse of Time and space Started and Ended right before the Creation of the
Omiverse
, where a race of Humanoids was forced to battle gods under the rule of a mysterious God, Soon to be revealed to be The Devil. At this time, Magistri Tempus could be observed and existed as a being. The race of humanoids proceeded to try and defeat Magistri Tempus. Magistri Tempus was then forced to restart time, resulting in multiple new Timelines and the
Omniverse
to begin. Magistri Tempus was then forced to become somewhat Non-Existant.
