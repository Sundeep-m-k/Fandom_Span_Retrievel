A Normal pocket Dimension / Reality is a small reality space with extremely varying size and dimensionality, ranging from around a femtometer to a couple million lightyears at the very extremes.
The difference between a Normal and
Special
pocket dimension is pretty complex, so here is a graph of all the details and differences:
Normal Pocket Dimension
Special Pocket Dimension
- Has a generally 'Normal' set law of physics
- Can be
*relatively* easy
to artificially create
- Very common compared to special pocket dimensions
- Limited dimensionality, 0d to 11d is most common, but any positive finite number is still allowed
- Very stable in structure, almost never collapses
- Free in terms of bound laws of physics
- No known way to create; only found naturally or from a high level god or entity
- Very rare, the only places where it is considered 'common' are usually where gods reside
- Can have up to infinite dimensionality and even negative dimensions
- Highly unstable and chaotic, however still isn't likely to collapse
There has even been an organisation which's purpose is to allow people access of a pocket dimension, in what is known as the
Small Pocket Dimension Complex
, containing a grid of Normal pocket dimensions each 1 kilometer wide.
