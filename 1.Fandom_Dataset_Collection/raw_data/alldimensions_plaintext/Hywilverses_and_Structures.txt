Hywilverses
[
]
Hywilverses
are verses that are beyond the
Hyperverse
(mostly size or location), that are still commonly found throughout the
Omniverse
.
The most common structures within our Omniverse are
Archverses
. Beyond that, the most common groups are either created artificially, or naturally occur only in one local region. Besides that, there are still many common verses that can be created anywhere in the Omniverse.
General verse types, like
Kaoverses
, don’t count as Hywilverses. Any verse can also be a Kaoverse, it is like a property, but only a
Megaverse
can be a Megaverse
Extended Archverses
[
]
The Megaverse is a semi-rare verse Hywilverse that can contain anything from just a single
Multiverse
(if it is a sufficiently large Multiverse), all the way to many Hyperverse clusters. Megaverses have similar properties to Archverses, but the difference is that a Megaverse also contains at least one Inforium bubble. Megaverses also have their own specific structures and creation process that feeds off of the Archverses it contains and the region it is in.
Extended Archverses beyond that, such as
Gigaverse
and Teraverses, are mostly just large verse barriers whose existence is possible due to the fact that the extended Archverses it contains all share something in common. Thanks to this property, one can predict where exactly an extended Archverse might form using the Karsi-Dussaue equations. The equations only describe the properties of one of the potential Megaverses, so inputing the set of extended Archverses that share something in common is left up to the user.
Orbiterverse
[
]
Orbiterverses are fairly small (<20 billion ly) verses that orbit Hyperverses. The circumstances that are capable of creating Hyperverses out of thin air are also capable of making other verses. Orbiterverses, though, are created using the same process as Hyperverses, but the process is slightly altered and doesn’t go as its expected to.
The name “Orbiterverse” comes from its tendency to orbit  Hyperverses, but also anything else. Orbiterverses have been observed orbiting literal elementary particles in large voids, as there was nothing else in its vicinity.
Aszen
[
]
Aszen are Multiverse-sized verses located within Gigaverses. On their edges and outskirts they contain normal Archverses, but as one goes in closer to its geometric center, one will find many fake versions of Archverses. Starting from normal Universes, moving on to smaller Multiverses, then small
Metaverses
and so on. All of these also fit within this one Aszen, so they are very scaled down versions.
Bloaq drops
[
]
Very early Archverses are filled with chaos particles. Chaotic particles, in the same way as the
Halgionic process
occurs, may disturb the surface of a verse. For Archverses this can happen the easiest, but it is only Xenoverses that have such stretchy borders. During this, if chaos particles manage to create a fold that completely encloses a volume of the Archverse, the volume will have to readjust its volume (for the same reason
Halgionic decoupling
happens), instantly inflating the enclosed bubble, and practically sealing itself shut. This bubble, whilst technically separate from its Archverse, is
absolutely verse
, and is called a Bloaq object. Whilst still in their early phases filled with chaos particles, they have the tendency of extending the inner flap of their covering fold, thus making them seemingly move like an upwards flowing viscous drop of liquid.
Hywilstructures
[
]
Aside from Hywilverses, there are also many Hywilstructures. There are actually more Hywilstructures than Hywilverses, as the definition of a verse is a fairly strict one.
Zlotelustros
[
]
When a piece of a verse’s border detaches from its main body, it can act as a concave / convex mirror for particles travelling in straight lines. Knowing its precise geometry, a civilization may capture such particles emanating from an origin point, like a supernova-esque event, by predicting their paths and focusing their instruments on them there.
Potskyho objects
[
]
Also known more commonly as the funneljet, is a
fuzzy area (LNB-4)
of non-Euclidian space with a singularity in the geometric middle. The space, shaped like the
y
=
1
x
{\displaystyle y=\frac{1}{x}}
graph, has an exotic singularity in the middle of it. The singularity attracts objects that move in its direction and repulses objects moving away from it. Thus, objects that get near it will start falling inwards, slow down drastically near the singularity, thanks to the curvature of space, and flung away.
Gullid strings
[
]
After pent up energy within a Gullidverse causes it to explode, its particles will be flung omni-directionally. Each particle has a very strong force that attracts nearby particles to it, and overlaid fields are drastically amplified. Thus, one particle will attract from all directions the same amount, but two particles have a higher chance of attracting from the direction normal to the point of their contact. If these particles get lucky, they can make long chains of these particles, which are called Gullid strings. However, a singular particle getting attracted and crashing in from the side instead of in the faces of the entire string will cause it to break apart and collapse into a ball.
Sellemheis
[
]
Verses that change the existence ranks of objects that violate its laws can sometimes trigger a strange phenomenon. When an event causes the entire border of a verse to break the laws of physics, the entire border and area of influence will have their existence rank changed, called a Sellemheis, leaving its naturally generated structures to be left out in the open. If this happens to a Universe, the insides are most likely safe, as the Multiverse is very similar to that of its Universes, but most any other case results in a slow dematerialization, as the matter is subject to a whole array of different laws that most likely aren’t compatible with it.
