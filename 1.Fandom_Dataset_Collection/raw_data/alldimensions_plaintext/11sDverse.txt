11sDverse
is a very special
verse
that contains every possible 2048 tiles, even infinite numbers. This would also include tiles with negative powers of 2. This is why the 11sDverse is also known as the
2048verse
. This verse has tons of tilium, an
hyperradioactive
element
. It is layered, each layer being circular, that loops until 2048 tiles.
The god / ruler of this verse is
11sD Tile
, a
TOG
and the reason this verse has such name.

Materials

]
The Core
[
]
The core is the most vital part of the 11sDverse. It can't be destroyed, overlapped, exploded, overflowed, nuked, etc. nless it runs out of 2048 tiles.
Layer
[
]
The layers are circle-shaped, and can't be destroyed unless they run of 2048 tiles or if the Core / 11sD Tile is destroyed.
11sD-Galaxy
They're the equivalent of a
galaxy
for the 11sDverse. They contain 2048 homes and 2048 tiles. The largest one contains other 11sD-Galaxies and is the home for 11sD Tile.
Cruish
[
]
These are variants of the 11sD-Galaxies with a more spiral-like shape, and they're formed when a 11sD-Galaxy start intensely shaking, so this means Cruishes are unstable. This process is known as Cruishing.
The God (11 sD Tile)
[
]
This is the ruler of the 11sDverse, living in the largest 11sD-Galaxy which is known as 11GAL-119. It has the ability to create 2048 tiles. Every 2048
OYC
it creates more 11sD-Galaxies to make the 11sDverse larger.
Since it is a TOG it can't be killed, destroyed, Cruished, overlapped, overflowed, nuked, abused, pushed, eated, etc. In fact, if you attempt to eat it, it'll eat you back instead, not like your mouth is that big.
