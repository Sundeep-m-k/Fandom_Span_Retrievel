The
down quark
or
d quark
(symbol: d) is the second-lightest of all
quarks
, a type of
elementary particle
, and a major constituent of
matter
. Together with the
up quark
, it forms the
neutrons
(one up quark, two down quarks) and
protons
(two up quarks, one down quark) of
atomic nuclei
. It is part of the first generation of matter, has an electric charge of −1/3 e and a
bare mass
of 4.8±0.4 MeV.
Like all
quarks
, the down quark is an
elementary
fermion with spin 1/2, and experiences all four fundamental interactions:
gravitation
,
electromagnetism
, weak interactions, and strong interactions. The
antiparticle
of the down quark is the
down antiquark
(sometimes called antidown quark or simply antidown), which differs from it only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.
Its existence (along with that of the
up
and
strange quarks
) was postulated in 1964 by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig to explain the Eightfold Way classification scheme of
hadrons
. The down quark was first observed by experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968.
The down quark contains a
String
.

The Anti-Down Quark, Down Antiquark or just Antidown is the exact same thing as an Down Quark, except the charge is negative, so the Anti-Down Quark just has a charge of +

e instead of -

/

e. When an Anti-Down quark meets an down quark, they annihilate and form a virtual photon, a particle that is incredibly short lived. Shortly after, it turns into some number of
electrons
and
positrons
.
A down quark decays into an
Up Quark
and a
W
-
Boson
, which is short lived, and decays into an
electron
and an
Electron antineutrino
. An example of this decay is the
neutron
. The
neutron
lives on average, about 900 seconds. When it decays, it forms a
proton
. The down quark subsequently decays into a
W
-
Boson
, which becomes an
electron
and an
Electron antineutrino
.
