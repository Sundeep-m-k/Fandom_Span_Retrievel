an attempt to talk. It failed because of different communication methods. In the end, during the experiment, these creatures did not notice the people and cut the spaceship with a fingernail
result: unsatisfactory.
experiment no.2
[

we built a giant with the help of a string ball, which we actually did for many months because of the inability to manage it well and sent it to these people. As a result, people took offense at him because his thoughts were colloquial speech for them. He became an outcast of society
result: satisfactory. You can guess what his thoughts were about because the giant committed suicide, but for him people looked creepy and ugly.
experiment no.3
[
]
we tried to fly into eyes of child of space that have  earth  instead of eyes and noticed that there are two opposites in each planet. People are stuck in the modern. on one planet, all humams  black girls are capitalists, and on the other, all humans white men are communists. They are all immortal. It is noticed that religion flourishes on the planet with girls and they worship the child of the cosmos, and on the other atheists believe that if they do not extract energy, then reality will die. They are all immortal and consider outsiders evil. They work daily. during the observation, this information was obtained. If you fly to them, they will want to kill you. other living organisms have not changed apart from a couple of differences: on one planet of girls, the grass is red, and on the other purple.
Also on these two planets there is no animal kingdom apart from humanity.
result: curious
