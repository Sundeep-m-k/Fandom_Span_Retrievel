Lifetime
Mostly ‚´ö OYC, some of them have shorter or longer lifetime.
Fake Wikiverse
is an inverted version of
Wikiverse
, it at size regular as ‚´ö‚´ö Light-Years. Fake wikiverse have more Outcodes.... than Fake Pageverses. Fake Wikiverse also contains Fake Templateverses, Fake Categoryverses, Fake Main Pageverse. They are contained by (obviously) Fake FANDOMverse, though, they can get contained by Pageverses, Wikiverses, and even FANDOMverse.
Fake Wikiverses just like any Wikiverses, but the way they work is a bit strange. They really look like as if they were inverted.  Also, due to the [ERROR]verses they contain, they get so much glitchiness that, when touching them would make them more unstable, so only TOGs can touch them. So, when a Wikiverse gets small enough that [ERROR]verses got contained, it pretty looks like it is fake.
However, when contributing the wiki, TOGs can directly edit wikiverses, but, they can also edit Fake wikiverses. And, the data Wikiverses have are similar to their fake versions (e.g. content of a Pageverse). That means these verses are similar to their actual looped wikis in this way.
The reason why they are fake is, because they are the smallest variations of the ones in Meta-Class 1, though they aren't that much fake, but how could they get this small? When a Wikiverse's content is low enough, they get this type of Verse, and it gets divided into two different versions.
Wikiverses, as said above, have got lots of different Fake Pageverses. Fake Pageverses in their own Fake Wikiverse looks like the color cyan but a bit different. The largest in terms of size is the Fake Mainpageverse, colored like magenta. All the fake Pageverses are connected to each other and to the center of a wiki (fake mainpageverse).
Also since it could contain infinitely many pages, and since it contains itself and by itself, every Fake Wikiverses are also self-contained, whether it has lots of space left or not.
