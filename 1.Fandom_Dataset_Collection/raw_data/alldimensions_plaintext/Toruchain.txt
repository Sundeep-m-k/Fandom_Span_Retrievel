A
Toruchain
is a verse that is composed of two interlocked torus-shaped objects, one always is a primary color (usually called the
primary hemitorus
), the other is always a secondary color (usually called the
secondary hemitorus
). A Toruchain is the combination of both, with the name coming from both hemitori being 'chained together'. A toruchain is opaque because it is almost filled with
Torukuverses
.
Color
[
]
The color of the hemitori are created from a spectrum, from what
Torus Chain
verses are most common within it. Hemitori are unstable if the most common Torus Chain verses are gray, causing some Torukuverses to be able to float inside them. Alternating colors of hemitori attract, creating a Toruchain.
Categories

Because of how Toruchains have to be primary-secondary, there are 9 categories of Toruchains, one for each kind of primary color (red-yellow-blue), and one for each secondary color (orange-green-purple).
A yellow-green Toruchain.
A blue-orange Toruchain.
A red-purple Toruchain.
