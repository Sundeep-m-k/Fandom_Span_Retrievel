About

The
concept
of a
MetaFegen
, which its name can be translated as "meta fake" or even "transcendent fake" given the context, consists of anything that has a degree of transcendence over
fiction
at a meta level, yet not enough to reach
real life
, thus still being "fake". Basically, a MetaFegen is the middle point bethween the REAL reality, and fiction.
This concept is also know as
MetaFalsum
, which has a pretty similar etymology: "meta false" or "transcendent false".
Examples
[
]
Structures / verses / pages
[
]
Things like a
Wikiverse
/ Wiki count as a MetaFegen, as it has transcendence over the fictional content of its articles, though it does not have such level of transcendence over the pages /
Pageverses
themselves, which also count as MetaFegens.
Entities
[
]
Though, not only
verses
are allowed to count as MetaFegens. An example of a
species
reaching this status are the
Transcendent Omni-Gods
, as they're virtual avatars of the
humans
controlling them which can distort fictional events, entities or structures, though the real humans themselves are NOT MetaFegens since they're part of real life.

It is also imperative to mention that concepts like the plot of a fictional piece is a conceptual MetaFegen, as your average entity can't "surpass" or "break" the plot. Even if they do something like a fourth wall break, it still counts as something that their writter decided to add to the plot, and not something the character actually did by itself, with no external meta-support. Yes, this means plot armor could count as another conceptual MetaFegen.
