what a golden experience

Infinite Golden Light
The Golden Light is the one who sends the
Star o
f Infinitum
to the wilderness to restore the sacred age.
Before
Time

Space
,
Reality
,
Chaos
,
Order
,
Infinity
, Or really
anything
and
nothing
at all, There was The Golden Light, It decides what IS, and what ISN'T
Abillities(kinda useless but extremely simplified):
Creation: obviously
Eradiction: Way more powerful than ERASURE at all, Can Erase
WTF-Level Beings
No: this just cancels, nullifies, instantly negates the thing, it's just GER on Sarpy Fragments (infinitely more potent than sarpy shards) times a millillion
Yes: Opposite of No
Absolution: "Makes something absolute, basically it changes causality (on a WTF-level) so even if you deny, skip, control or even erase fate itself, you will still be fated to do something or have something happen to you" times infinity
Author Denial: it doesn't matter if you make a story against the golden light, it will just make the story crumble into dust
Ontological Control: I don't see anyone really having this ability, being able to control "the" "is" "was" "why" "yes" "no" "and" "I", ontology is just like idk the study of existence or something
And that's basically the abilities, There's Technically a ℵ
ℵ∞^ℵש^ʍ↑↑↑↑↑(infinite times) ש+ש × ∞^millillion
times itself more abilities while having even more variations and combinations of those abilities
