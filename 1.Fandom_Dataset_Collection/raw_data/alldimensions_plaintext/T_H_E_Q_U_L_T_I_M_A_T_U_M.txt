The Qultimatum
, or
T H E  Q U L T I M A T U M
, is the 4th step in the
Ultimatum's chain
. Unlike the others in this chain, a good space of the Qultimatum has toxic sustances that could even kill some of the strongest gods, making the Qultimatum one of the most dangerous verses of all in the chain.
Temperature? Varies, like the others in the
Ultimatum's chain
. But, heres the special thing: in the areas where the toxic sustances are, the temperature is a lot smaller than in the other parts. So, if you start to feel extremly cold, be careful, because theres a chance that the toxic sustances are close.
Also, another thing about the toxic sustances is that they move. So, some safe areas will become now dangerous, or the opposite. In some cases they could even destroy lots of 'verses in their way, so these sustances are VEEERY dangerous.

A little bit smaller than the Qultimatum itself
Here we will be talking a bit more about the toxic substance. About its name, it doesnt have an scientific name yet. So, its called toxic substance (Yea, very original, xd). Just enjoy. Like, i dont have nothing more to explain.
