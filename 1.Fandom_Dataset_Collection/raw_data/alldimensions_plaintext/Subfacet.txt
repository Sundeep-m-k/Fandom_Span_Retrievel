An
n
-dimensional polytope is bounded by a number of (
n
âˆ’ 1)-dimensional
facets
. They can also be called as "elements" of a polytope.
Subfacets include: vertices, edges, faces, cells, etc...

Vertex
[
]
A vertex is a
zero-dimensional
subfacet. Two or more vertices create an edge.
Edge
[
]
An
edge
is a
one-dimensional
subfacet. Two or more edges meet at a vertex. A face is made up of three or more edges.
Face
[
]
A
face
is a
two-dimensional
subfacet. Two or more faces meet at an edge.
Cell
[
]
A
cell
is a
three-dimensional
subfacet
. Two or more cells meet at a
face
. A
teron
is made up of five or more cells.
