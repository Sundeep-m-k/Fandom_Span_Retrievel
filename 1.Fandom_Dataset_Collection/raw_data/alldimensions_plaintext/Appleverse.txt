The Appleverse is an extremely strange verse in another one of those chains. It looks like an apple but it is not edible. Since all of these verses are random objects and this one is the smallest, this verse right now has no purpose.
Since it is so small, it is rarely visited since it is a lot of effort to go through these object verses. This one doesn't really contain anything, so people don't even want to come here.
The problem is that it doesn't do anything, so even if this was the largest verse ever and would be visited a lot, people wouldn't even care about it because it just serves as a pointless placeholder of a verse.
Whoever made this verse must have been very bored because it really doesn't have a purpose, neither does it have a reason to even exist at all, but sometimes the simplest things are the best because they are the most appealing for some peopleÂ :)
