NOTE: THIS IS A SECONDARY HIERARCHY, TO SEE THE CANON ONE CLICK
HERE
.
Literally freaking everything is a hierarchy surpassing
The Wikiversal Hierarchy
and this has it's very own class system like
Post-TBE Nonlinear Hierarchy
. This is ALL very underestimated. So underestimated even this disclaimer is underestimated. The smallest verse in it is
The Biggest EVER
. This hierarchy is ranked as H

2

Primitive
(Freaking Class 1)
[
]
The Primitive Class is, well, the smallest class, pretty much like a
Primition,
and contains all 38,610 pages, blog posts and categories on this wiki. It's a looped class that can never be escaped and might as well be a hierarchy of its own.
The Smallest Class is constantly increasing and basically inescapable. To escape it you need something so fundamentally beyond and LOOOOONG that it surpasses anything at all.
To see this full hierarchy see this page:

Sub-existential
(Freaking Class 2)
[

This page, despite its name, is so unimaginably big that no "in no hierarchy arguments" can put it anywhere but this tier. We've still a long way to go.
The Something Bigger
claims to be bigger than the entire Literally Freaking Everything, but ultimately belongs in this class.
The Something Bigger
T.H.E E.N.D

Xeno-Loop
The Final thing
Elementary
(Freaking Class 3)
[

This class goes for LONG. LONG BASICALLY MEANS FOREVER BUT NOW LONG HAS BEEN OVERTAKEN BY A BIGGER NUMBER SO NOW EVERY TIME I SAID LONG I JUST MEAN THE CURRENT MOST BIGGEST NUMBER WHICH IS ALWAYS CHANGING. It's very very very very long. Ok?
Atomic
(Freaking Class 4)

SO BIG SO LONG.
This hierarchy goes on for LONG. LONG BASICALLY MEANS FOREVER BUT NOW LONG HAS BEEN OVERTAKEN BY A BIGGER NUMBER SO NOW EVERY TIME I SAID LONG I JUST MEAN THE CURRENT MOST BIGGEST NUMBER WHICH IS ALWAYS CHANGING.
Molecular
(Freaking Class 5)

I'm sure you get the gist. This class contains literally freaking everything. Anything that says it contains literally freaking everything other than Literally Freaking Everything in below Freaking Class 5.
Microscopic
(Freaking Class 6)
[
]
This is MICROSCOPIC compared to everything else, yet this class is SOOOOOO big. The numbers in this class surpass even The Great Π in
Beyond Ω
.
Miniscule
(Freaking Class 7)
[

So big, whole
Beyond Ω
REGIMENTS are passed with every entry.
Tiny
(Freaking Class 8)
[
]
Grows so fast and LONG, whole Superregiments are skipped, we're straight to STAGES.
Small
(Freaking Class 9)
[
]
We're at tiers, we skipped Superstages and Megastages!
Medium

You are half way, but things are getting     L  O  N  G

No more descriptions can be handed out. It's simply... too LONG!!!!!!!
