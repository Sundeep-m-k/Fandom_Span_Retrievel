‽ or Banígerafinity is a colossal, outrageous, gigantic omeganumber transfinitely larger than any number that could possibly exist.

First, we define the function L(x), where L(x) = L(x-1){L(x-1)}L(x-1) and L(0) = Ħ
This function's values will be as follows:
L(1) = Ħ{Ħ}Ħ = Ħ
1
L(2) = Ħ
1
{Ħ
1
}Ħ
1
= Ħ
2
L(3) = Ħ
2
{Ħ
2
}Ħ
2
= Ħ
3
Etc.
With this function, ‽ is defined as Ħ
Ħ
(L(Ħ)). This means it is the product of infinite infinite operations, which, if you haven't noticed already, means it is really really big.
