The
Never-Ending Void of Darkness
is another one of those "endless voids" in this wiki. This void isn't really special.
It is basically a wide, open, dark, pitch black, empty, and endless void that is outside of
The Enormous
.
There is practically nothing inside this void, except that it has one planet made completely out of Glitchonicite every

planets will have life. That means life is extremely rare. This life is actually quite advanced. They have discovered void manipulation and wormhole travel. These creatures have attempted to travel to
The Enormous
in the center of this void, but they have all failed.
Out here, unknown creatures more powerful than any Primordial Entity lurk unfathomable distances away from
The Enormous
. There are rumors that they are going to consume
The Enormous
in 100 trillion
OYC
, but that claim has no evidence.
This void has never been traveled out of by any creature. Only the most truly omnipotent gods have escaped this void.
