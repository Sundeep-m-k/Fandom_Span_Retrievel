Ummmm.......
is a place that receives its name because we know almost nothing about it. We dont even know if it even exists properly or not, making it very confusing. From descriptions of the very few entities who have been to this theorical verse (some even said it must have been a dream), it violently disintegrates, then regenerates about every 10 seconds.
Interesting facts
During the time that Ummmm......... is non existent from disintegration, the rest of the verses that are smaller than it are also non existent, but WE stay exitstent because we cannot comprehend truly non-existent things.
