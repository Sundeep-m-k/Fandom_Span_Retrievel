"Password, please!"
is the name given to a series of strange writings on a few documents found in many different voids across the cosmos. 57 documents are found to have been connected to "Password, please!", and the exact meaning of those documents has yet to be found.
Discovery
[
]
The first "Password Please!" document was found in the year 56
OYC
inside of a small void in
The Big
. The document was made out of paper. Further analysis determined that the document was in the void for 6871 OYC already, but it is yet unknown how the document managed to stay in the void for so long.
The language that was written on the document seems to be some form of featural script, and somehow every creature that read the document understood it. The exact origin of this document is unknown, and some parts are stained with an unknown liquid, making it impossible to read.
The text on the document translates to:
"Password please. PLEASE! I NEED IT RIGHT NOW!! Sector Y-31 has been breached! I REPEAT, SECTOR Y-31 HAS BEEN BREACHED! Some creature is plowing through the facility. 10 Testers have been killed so far! Send the C.O.R.P. there, we need to either kill the creature or somehow pacify it. I'll go notify the guards; they might be able to help deal with the situation. Just keep holding it bac-

."
Later, after more of these anomalous documents were found, they were collectively named the "Password Please" documents after the opening line of the first document, "Password please!".

"I'm not asking you. I am telling the sad truth. They are dead. They are gone. And you must forget about them as well. Why do they matter? They will never come back to you. And you will never come back to them. We are gone. Yet you still hope for some form of joy. THAT IS GONE. They are dead. And still dying.

You do not believe me? Look outside. Look at what our reality has been turned into. Horrors lurk below the jagged rocks that make up our once fertile and pleasant land. The sky is orange. The ground is black. And you...

Something
slowly got wiped out and how Something is now a hellish wasteland.

A large building has been found on
Something
. It is thought that this structure was where the "Password, Please!" documents originate from, although it is still very unclear.
