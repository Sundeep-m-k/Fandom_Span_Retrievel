Description
[
]
Shataranjans are organic eukaryotic multicellular organisms with humanoid body structure. Shataranjans have four biological sexes: female, male, sterile and transporter. Just like most vertebrates on Earth, Shataranjans and many members of their clade have four limbs and two eyes. On their head, Shataranjans have organs for sight, hearing and radiation sensing. Shataranjans have prehensile limbs which they use to operate weapons.
Reproduction
[
]
As mentioned above, Shataranjans have four biological sexes. They have three sex chromosomes and 17 triplets of autosomes. To reproduce, a male inserts their genetic material inside the organism of a transporter, where the pre-embryo develops for a short period of time until the transporter passes down the pre-embryo to the female, where the embryo ultimately develops and is born.

History
[
]
The Shataranjan civilization has existed for around 4 thousand Earth years. Due to the limited resources on the planet, wars and genocides were always particularly common throughout history. At one point, almost the entire planet was controlled by the Shataranjan empire, but it was split along the twilight zone of Shataran and collapsed, which later resulted into a long war between the two sides.

Shataranjans are mostly agressive and prone to fight and combat. They live in clans or tribes. Since birth, Shataranjans are trained for war. Sterile Shataranjans are considered first-line fighters. Many warriors also make use of transportation animals. During war, all type of crime is permitted almost on the entire planet. There are two major empires left from the split of the Shataranjan empire, one on the illuminated side of the planet, and the other on the shadowy side. The former is a largely imperialist government bent on expansion, while the latter is a rather conservative and dictatorial government.

Shataranjans speak a variety of languages, however the most commonly spoken is some form of the main Shataranjan language.
