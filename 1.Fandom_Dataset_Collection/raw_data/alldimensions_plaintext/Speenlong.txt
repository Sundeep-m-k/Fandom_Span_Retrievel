Speenlongs
are smaller and more dangerous counterparts to
Sproyongs
. In most areas they are incredibly rare or do not exist at all, but in some they are more common than 100/LY.

Types of speenlongs
[
]
Type 1
[
]
Type 1 speenlongs are the smallest, weakest forms of speenlongs. They measure from 2mm-8mm diameter, and are always blue and spherical. Type 1s do not move, instead waiting to be hit by a random
universe
. Universes smaller than 188,000,000,000LY are vulnerable to type 1s, and universes larger will just absorb them. Upon infection from a type 1, the speenlong will wait for upwards of 2,000,000,000 years, before spewing out quintillions of tiny blue spores in all directions. These spores convert all matter they come into contact with into more spores, until the entire universe is converted to type 1s.
Rarity is avg. 2/LY.
Type 2
[
]
Type 2 speenlongs measure about 10-40mm in diameter, and are significantly more dangerous than type 1s. They travel throughout interuniversal space at 4,300,000c-8,900,000c, in search of hosts. When a host universe (all sizes are possible to infect) is found, the type 2 will either wait to mature, or if it is already mature, it will explode, obliterating everything in the host universe and occasionally neighboring universes. It is unknown how they reproduce. Type 2s always look like platonic or kepler solids, and are 50% of the time all red, and 50% of the time random other colors.
Rarity is avg. 0.08/LY.
Type 3A
[
]
Type 3A speenlongs are even more dangerous than type 1s and type 2s, but on a longer term. They are dormant for trillions of years, but as soon as they reach a certain age (1-999 trillion years), they begin to rapidly spew out vigintillions neutrino sized spores in all directions per second, at 480,000,000,000c. Spore release ends after 1-9 million years. When these spores reach a host, they go dormant until they reach their max size / spore releasing age. Max size for Type 3As is anywhere from 3-1,090LY. When a speenlong dies, all of its spores fly out, and then it explodes with enough force to obliterate even
multiverses
. They do not interact with light, and thus do not have an appearance. Their shape is basically random.
Rarity is avg. 0.00005/LY.
Type 3B
[
]
Type 3B speenlongs are a variant of speenlong almost identical to Type 3A, with differences including interacting with light, not exploding on death, and not actually being dormant, instead flying in search for a host multiverse or
universe cluster
.
Rarity is avg. 1.8x10
-15
/LY.
Type 4
[
]
Type 4 speenlongs are the second most dangerous types of speenlong. They absorb all matter they come into contact with into themselves. They do not interact with light, and can travel at over 12,000,000,000,000c. They seek out universe clusters, which they can absorb in a matter of hours. Type 4 lifespan is only 3 years, but in that time they can easily absorb trillions of universes. They form spontaneously and randomly, and thus can form in any universe, unlike all previous forms of speenlong. This is why they are so dangerous, and in the right conditions, they could take over an entire
megaverse
.
Rarity is avg. 2.4x10
-28
/LY.
Type 5
[
]
Type 5s are the most dangerous speenlongs. They form randomly in universes, and upon formation, they instantly take over the entire universe they formed in. Then they convert all the matter from the host universe into neutrino sized spores, and fling them out at over 160,000,000,000,000,000c. They die immediately after releasing all spores. When a spore reaches a host universe, it stops moving, absorbs its shell, and becomes active. Upon activation, they, as you might expect, take over the entire host universe, and start the cycle over again. Type 5s too do not interact with light, and are not detectable by any means available to pre-
omniverse
life. The spore release period is anywhere from 1-4,000,000 years long.
Rarity is avg. 9.8x10
-4,993,281
/LY. The highest rarity has ever been was 1.1x10
-13
/LY.
shell
[
]
The shell of a spore is an infinitely thin layer of nearly indestructible material that allows it to travel through interuniversal space and into universes without being harmed. Thanks to spore shells, type 5 spores have a 99.99999999999999944823% chance of activation.

Speenlongs as weapons
[
]
Speenlongs have been used for nefarious diabolical devious silly ahh purposes on multiple occasions, although this has never had good results. In 59% of  cases of speenlongs being used as weapons, the users forgot that speenlongs are activated when they enter a universe, so they brought them into their own universe and thus died instantly. Because using type 1s as weapons is retarded, most attempts involved type 3/4s or type 5s. Sadly no attempts at obtaining a type 5 for such purposes has ever gotten past the "finding a type 5" phase.
