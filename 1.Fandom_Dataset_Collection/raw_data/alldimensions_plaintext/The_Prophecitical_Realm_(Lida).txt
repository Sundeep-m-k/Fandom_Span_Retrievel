About
[
]
The
Prophecitical Realm
is a plane located somewhere in a random
Multiverse
.
Locating / Appearance
[
]
Initial discovery
[
]
To locate the Prophecitical Realm, you have to find a large bubble with purple and blue coloring with a door leading to the inside. Once inside, there are stairs and goblets surrounding you, and once you climb up the stairs there will be an
entity
known as an "Ophanim" waiting for you.
Beyond the Ophanim
[
]
The Ophanim will ask a series of questions, in order to see if you are able to be trusted to go into the door leading to inside of this realm.
Inside the Realm
[
]
Once inside the Prophecitical Realm, instead of the usual darkness of the cosmos found within most
verses
, its insides are completely filled with a white glowth, along with holy music playing everywhere across the realm. There are
planets
here, and ONLY planets. No stars, black holes, galaxies, etc. can be found here.
Story
[
]
Even though it is unknown when this realm made, we do know about its creator, who is none other than the Ophanim that guards its gates, which identifies itself under the name "Lida".
Lida made this verse, in an attempt to create an
artificial
afterlife
for whatever verse it would be in. Eventually, it is theorized that its local multiverse formed around it, so the Prophecitical Realm turned into its local afterlife realm.
