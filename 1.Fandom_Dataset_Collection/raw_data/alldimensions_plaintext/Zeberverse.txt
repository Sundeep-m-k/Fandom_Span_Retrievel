The Zeberverse has the size of about
Ï‰
{\displaystyle \omega}
Universes. It was made septillions of years ago by
RapsterZeber
, the god of the Zeberverse.
The Zeberverse does not exist with any of the other Universes/Dimensions/anything-else-on-this-wiki-other-than-the-pages-involving-the-Zeberverse. It has a what happens in the Zeberverse stays in the Zeberverse vibe, but also what happens outside of the Zeberverse stays outside of the Zeberverse vibe as well.
No one knows that the Zeberverse exists. And even if someone did, they would have no idea where the Zeberverse is. Even if you can travel omegaly fast you would never reach the Zeberverse, not even after Omega years. No one even knows where or not the Zeberverse exists, or if it is just the product of someone's imagination. In fact, the Zeberverse might only exist as text on some sort of screen being read at this very moment by giants on a website called Fandom on a wiki called the All Dimensions Wiki. Wouldn't that be stupid?
But that could explain why no one can reach the Zeberverse. There is a wall keeping the Zeberverse separate from the rest of this wiki, if this metaphor even has the slightest bit of truth to it.
