The
islandVerse
is an unique
verse
in which there are lots of cosmic islands full of bundles of feelings. Everyone has an island, specially the younger and/or more hyperactive
individuals
.
This
article
is in where you can put sightings of these dreamy worlds by editing the page. Below, the description there are some islands of my (the article's creator) friends.
But, before you enter, here are some ways to get there: there is a chance of no clipping threw one of the world by finding the end of the rainbow or ascending to another plane of existence when you’re friend tells you a joke that you’ve already heard. Each island will have different difficulties for example: Peaceful, nice, neutral, hostile, chaotic.
The glitch island
The glitch island has a difficulty of hostile for dangerous glitching creatures that want to rip your skull out or corrupt you. This island is very glitchy and you risk no clipping out of the island and falling in to the abysses of the subconscious. It has lots of glitchy corpses everywhere and one of the most peaceful places on the island is the village of the glitched people known as glitchtopia.
Dino island
The Dino island is inhabited by lots of dinosaurs and has a restaurant located in the middle of the island. The restaurant serves dino nuggets and dream essence that can be used to escape the abysses of the subconscious.This island is located near the glitch island and the Fantasy island.It has a difficulty of neutral.

This island has a difficulty of chaotic because of its high entity count and dangerous traps. It was originally a neutral island but ending up being corrupted in an unknown way. Possibly by slipping into the abyss of the subconscious and surviving. If you somehow survive this brutal h£ll, you will find a trophy on the 100th day and you’d can use it to escape. The problem is that time is very weird and you can quickly go insane depending how strong you are.
The abyss is not an island, it is a place under every island. It has a difficulty of nice cause it has some monsters but they are hard to acces and the abyss is just an endless hole that means it is not dangerous because you can’t fall and splatter. The abyss+ is the deeper part with a difficulty of chaotic since the monsters are everywhere and the speed can likely damage you’re blood vessels.
That is all the examples! It will be officially updated again but be free to edit this fandoms page if you like with other thing about the islandVerse.
