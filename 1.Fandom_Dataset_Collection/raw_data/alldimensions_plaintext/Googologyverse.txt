The Googologyverse is a verse made to hold verses based on googology. It was formed when a bunch of cell-like verses called
Organicverses
went beserk and evolved to use a variety of systems to expand. Groups of these organicverses then each expanded in their own ways and formed verses related to googology.
The more complex the system of the googology related verse is, the rarer it is. Verses that have more simple systems behind them, like
Lineararrayverse
and
TREEVERSE
, are pretty common.
There is very advanced life here called Numerans that have got outside of here and has gotten close to colonizing the
Inacessibleverse
. However, they haven't exactly got there yet.
