The
Oppositeverse
is a verse where quantum mechanics affects
larger structures more than smaller
. In other words, the effects of the quantum world is
mapped onto the macroscopic world
.
Since life exists in the center point between the
microscopic and macroscopic
, life exists just as abundantly as life in a normal verse.
The unfortunate fact is
, that as size increases, so do the effects,
but exponentially
. This means that beings are permanently trapped within the
Oppositeverse
, as the edges of the
Oppositeverse
possess
infinite chaos and disorder
.
