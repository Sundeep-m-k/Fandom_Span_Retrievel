The super sarper
The
Hyper Sarper
is a Hyperspace-like Sarper and the third Sarper of
the Sarper chain
, which contains Î© copies of the
super sarper
each.
it's coloured diamond and it also has a werid effect, every time a entity there dies they turn into carbon and then diamond gas which turns into golden gas by the werid magic there and turns into a soild golden super sarper,
OOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRR
if a entity attacks anything that the hyper sarpy is made out of, the force reverses and doubles that means it comes into the entity, so if you did a planet shattering attack on the ground the damage that comes back to you would feel like you got hit by 2 crashing planets
yeah enjoy that info
