Microest
are
A B S U R D L Y
small particles that exists, but many think that their existence is only a myth. This is because they're so small, unstable and hard to see with with even the most advanced materials, that there is literally no image that exists of them. Or at least until an image that is rumored to exist in the same place that has the only image of
Tiniest
exists will be leaked. It is said that the Microests look like rainbow static-like colored orbs.
Around one hundred and one thousand Microests can exist within a Tiniest at once. Unlike previous particles, Microests luckily cant just randomly explode and destroy everything around them. This is because their unstability is so high that in some aspects it somehow loops back to being stable, like if they somehow overflowed the "limit" of unstableness.
Microest Formation
[
]
The reason why Microests even exists is because when a
Tinything
dies, many Microests burst out of it. Most Microests appears in the Tiniest's core because that is where the highest amount of Tinythings exist.
Overall

Microests are unreasonably small particles that exists in a Tiniest. They are so unstable some of their aspects loop back to being stable. Real appearence of them is not known.
