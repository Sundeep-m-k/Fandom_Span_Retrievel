A
Horsewomb
.
is a really small type of
verse
that can appear in random locations within most things described in this
Wikiverse
. The appearance of a Horsewomb. consists of a white sphere with the word "Horsewomb." written on it, period included, hence their name. Every Horsewomb. is connected using signals.
Structure
[
]
Horsewomb.s do not have material on the outside, because it is just pure
matter
. The inside, however, contains a copy of all matter ever, condensed into a very small space.
The inside is also shaped like an
Octagon
. This is because there is a weird gravity in the inside of any Horsewomb., along with an esophagus in the middle, meaning you can feed the Horsewomb.s. However, feeding any Horsewomb. is nearly impossible due to their outside being pure matter.

The polar opposite outside and inside of the Horsewomb.s make them give out some sort of verse signal. The verse signal will connect all near Horsewomb.s and prevent them from going more than 10^10,000 ly away from each other. These signals are invisible and they cannot be felt, but they have temperature.

Sometimes, when a Horsewomb. has more than three connections to other Horsewomb.s, their outside and inside will switch places and will no longer give signals to other Horsewomb.s. These inversions, due to the fact that they are technically polar opposites of Horsewomb.s, are no longer classified as regular Horsewomb.s. Instead, they are classified as some "Task! Force, Iris;s". Task! Force, Iris;s have a negative connection to eachother in a similar manner to conventional Horsewomb.s, but their connection is not related to Horsewomb. connections at all. If a Horsewomb. and a Task! Force, Iris; get near eachother, both of them will lose their signal and will not be Horsewomb.s or Task! Force, Iris;s anymore, and will instead be regular verses.
