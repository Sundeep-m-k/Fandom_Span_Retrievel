The
Hyperudettaverse
is a xettaverse in which sounds only over 90 dB are produced. Any lower, and they cant be heard. In the middle of the
Hyperudettaverse,
there is a Superplutonistar and a planet called
J-401ab
that is orbiting said Superplutonistar.
The
Hyperudettaverse
dates back to around 3.7 billion years ago, when a cluster of Plutonistars formed together and (with the help of a few older clusters from the neighboring Kermaverse that flew out) formed it.
