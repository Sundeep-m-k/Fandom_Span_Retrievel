Beyond godities
- entities that can make contradictions, mostly focusing on FIXING other contradictions. Since this is part of their force there is no contradiction, though. What is the contradiction if their power is to make them?
Types
[
]
Normal / common
[
]
They make contradictions in the verses to justify them. When a new, ilogical verse is found, they add a role and a plan to it and stand up for the creators. (limit of power:

Creators
[
]
They make hierarchies. Examples are the
gigachad hierarchy
and
the baller hierarchy
. In case they're needed they can also help in the task of the normal beyond godities. This species is also the one responsible of making
false godity spaces
. (limit of power:

Primidials
[
]
These are the strongest type of beyond godities, able to create the previous types for them to do different tasks. They'll do everything neccesary in order to make it so there are no contradictions. This type is also the one responsible of doing some
primidial godity spaces
, thus giving them the name they have. (limit of power:
primidial godity space
