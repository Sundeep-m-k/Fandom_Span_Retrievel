</p><p>Arrasverse, also called Woomyverse or Diepverse, is a verse located near our <a href="/wiki/Omniverse" title="Omniverse">omniverse</a>. It's in static orbit, completing one orbit every single time omniverse rotates. It <s>is</s> was a flourishing world of celestials and powerful beings thriving all together. Now, it is a battlefield of brand-new beings risen from unknown era, trying to take over the entire verse. The war has not ended since the beginning of it, and intensity of war greatly fluctuated throughout verse's history.

<p>Obviously, Arrasverse is a verse; it is not a mere empty stage set for history to unfold. It has its own unique principles of physics, determining how objects may behave. In fact, the physics of Arrasverse is much closer to that of messed-up verse, rather than stable kinds like our <a href="/wiki/Universe" title="Universe">universe</a>. The physic is so screwed up and unstable, it literally has record for deleting parts of Arrasverse history few times in the past.

<p>Physics of Arrasverse is majorly irregular. It has different physics for every places, where many of them are suppressed by main physics that they cannot do actual influences. Which main physics themselves, are divided into several regions distinguished by distance from central core of Arrasverse. Maximum influence of Arrasverse physics extends beyond hundreds of times radius of verse, causing weird abnormalities. Sometimes faint physics tangle with bypassing verses' physics, and partially or completely ruin it.
</p>
<ul><li><b><big>Main physics 1: Outside &amp; Border physics</big></b>: At the outer part of Arrasverse, like <a href="/wiki/Miniverse" title="Miniverse">miniverses</a>, Arrasverse physics likes to mess with perception of size. For example, the border of Arrasverse is unusually thick from viewpoint of outside observer, which expands to space hundreds of times bigger than verse itself from perspective of objects passing through the border. Then, the border slowly fades away when observer fully enters Arrasverse, exposing nearby verses and nebulae. So the border <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2Fp32UlpuI">contains as much objects as omniverse, and other times it contains nothing at all</a>.
<ul><li><b><big>Sub physics #1 / weak physics (outer physics)</big></b>: There is an imaginary sphere enveloping arrasverse. It is the sphere of weak physics, where jumble of arrasverse's physics slowly fade away to nothing at far place, and quite strong at close-border space. Weak physics are responsible for formation extremely sparsely-placed clouds of polygons and verse objects. Some polygons inside influence of weak physics turn into <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACPolygons">influx polygons</a>, falling down along with few other exotic polygons as occasional meteoric impact through arrasverse border.</li>
<li><b><big>Sub physics #2 / Perspective particle related</big></b>: The most important particles in arrasverse border are Perspective Particles. They have unique ability to arrange into totally different, very real worlds. But it does not construct same world for everything else; they provide totally different realm for every single observer who comes around it. That means, with massive quantity of Perspective Particles densely composing Arrasverse border, they trap individual observer in a realm hundreds of times bigger in diameter than Arrasverse.
<ul><li><b><big>P.particle physics #1 / Formation</big></b>: Arrasverse's <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACThe_Primordial_Egg">The Primordial Egg</a>, its structure sustaining the whole verse, constantly blows wind of energy toward the border. Perspective Particle is able to harvest this energy to concentrate energy around itself, exciting very existence of space to create another kind of itself. Even one perspective particle can repeat the process to stockpile truly astronomical amount of perspective particles. The reason why perspective particles do not get carried by very same energy wind it use to replicate, is that they require the condition provided by Arrasverse's Outside &amp; Border physics to work. In inter-<a href="/wiki/Verse" title="Verse">versal</a> space where there is no physics at all, Perspective Particles simply dissolve into slow-moving energy particles. It generates faint aura around arrasverse, and because it has been accumulating almost from the beginning of arrasverse, the energy aura of arrasverse is fatal to any object coming close to it.</li>
<li><b><big>P.particle physics #2 / Base principles</big></b>: Single Perspective Particle can be in multiple places at once. But it does not mean same particle can build entire verse solely by itself, or rather an example of its most essential property. Example of the main property at work is "when ANY two or more objects that has ability to observe and break superposition of certain particle governed by quantum mechanical laws, Perspective Particle can be in two different places for each observing object". This would cause randomly scattered clumps of Perspective Particles without any laws forging them into working verse in different verse.</li>
<li><b><big>P.particle physics #3 / Uniform behavior</big></b>: Perspective particles are composed of <a href="/wiki/Absolutely_tiny_particles" title="Absolutely tiny particles">various tiny particles and fabrics</a>, sort of "programming" the physics into the Perspective Particles. The physics of Perspective Particles completely does not work when there is only 1 of it, but it works via complexity of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16W7c0mb-rE">emergence</a>. <b>The first one</b>, recorded in complex structure of <a href="/wiki/Thingk" title="Thingk">Thingk</a>, <a href="/wiki/ATSL_uqraek_fiber" title="ATSL uqraek fiber">ATSL</a> and normal <a href="/wiki/Uqraek_fiber" title="Uqraek fiber">Uqraek fiber</a>, orders Perspective Particles to act under the rules of attraction. It can include particle-transmitted gravity, magetic forces, and other forces working outside of most <a href="/wiki/Universe" title="Universe">universes</a>. <b>The second one</b>, recorded in Uqraek fiber tied by randomly-vibrating <a href="/wiki/ATSL_strings" title="ATSL strings">ATSL strings</a>, allows Perspective Particles to construct varying complexes, objects, and universe each time they attract other of their kind. <b>The third one</b>, solely done by few <a href="/wiki/Mandelsok" title="Mandelsok">mandelsoks</a> communicating via huge <a href="/wiki/Hecc" title="Hecc">Hecc</a> particles and their cousins, plants possibilities of emergences in newborn Perspective Particle universes.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Sub physics #3 / Gravitation physics</big></b>: Right after the arrasverse's Perspective Particle border, exists a single physics that allow gravity to happen. Only that, and no other physics exist here. And gravitation physics of Arrasverse border is disappointingly weak; even the singularity of most <a href="/wiki/Universe" title="Universe">universes</a> will dissolve into nothingness because not enough gravity is generated to keep the singularity intact. This extremely weak gravitation physics is product of Perspective Particles. Nothing but laws of gravity spills out of huge Perspective Particle lump. One of the particle may cause immeasurably tiny gravitational effect, but with semi-limitless amount of them available, the particles of arrasverse border creates something equivalent to "(2-dimensional sphere-shaped) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_singularity">naked singularity</a>" around it.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li><b><big>Main physics 2: Outer physics</big></b>: From the exact point where border is no longer perceived, Outer physics slowly take over. The outer physics have ability to randomly compress space and create "polygons". In other words, physics start to perform alchemy out of empty space. Although amount of polygons forming here are absolutely ignorable (compared to median and other regions), it is the sign of Arrasverse's uniqueness revealing its form.
<ul><li><b><big>Sub physics #1 / Polygon physics</big></b>: In the influence of outer physics, the most unique physics of arrasverse is everywhere. Polygon physics are various little physics arranged together to compress space and turn them into (or at least try to) stable polygonal structure containing quite a bit of energy. They generate "flashes" of energy which polygons desperately need to be created or evolve, and energy flashes tend to happen at space with high energy level. Bigger the flash, the bigger polygon is born at its initial formation while already existing polygon can evolve tens of steps at maximum. The bonds between mini-physics acting as Polygon Physics is strong, and tons of energy is required for them to be differentiated to individual mini-physics. It is also a reason where no polygons are made around <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACThe_Primordial_Egg">The Primordial Egg</a>, because composer of Polygon Physics, the mini-physics, are torn apart so they are no more than useless property of space.</li>
<li><b><big>Sub physics #2 / Basic verse physics</big></b>: Arrasverse is a verse (very obviously), and verses are bounded to have physics associated with formation and governing of usual verse objects, examples being: stars, planets, particles, and laws making them happen or move and perform actions. In most cases (excluding unstable spaces where normal verse physics can be completely dominant over arrasverse's one), arrasverse successfully suppresses freedom of <s>speech</s> invocation for "formation" parts of usual verse physics; freedom of invocation is allowed only for act-part physics, such as electromagnetism and nuclear force. Because of that, polygons follow rules of those physics.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Main physics 3: Median physics</big></b>: No unmoving object can stand still here; median physics include gravity and electromagnetism (transferred by particles AND bending of space), meaning the primordial egg, the core of Arrasverse, can start applying annoying influences on everything contained in median physics. Eventually, polygons and everything are bound to be attracted to inner physics' influential region. Formations of objects become mildly frequent, and small battles between entities occasionally happen.
<ul><li><b><big>Sub physics #1 / Precise verse physics</big></b>: Although the verse physics don't get a chance to perform their full function, they still get gradually complicated toward the center of verse. Appearance of it is polygons acting with more complexity and achieving greater emergence when collected together. It also is blueprint for arrasverse object physics, basically arrasverse-style version of Precise Verse Physics superior than it.</li>
<li><b><big>Sub physics #2 / Advanced polygon field</big></b>: Without polygon physics, polygon field cannot be activated. Without polygon field, polygon physics cannot be activated either. They are in unbreakable mutualistic relationship that is essential for every single polygons in arrasverse. Energy flash in polygon physics excite polygon field, creating polygons. Polygon fields exist from very surface of The Primordial Egg to Perspective Particle border, it is only complexity that gets different deeper into arrasverse and closer to The Primordial Egg. Similar to polygon physics, polygon field itself is not composed of one, powerful field, but many different sub-field joining together into one, working thing. The bonds between sub-fields don't easily break near The Primordial Egg, or rather, it looses many important sub-fields and decays into something that is only able to form disappointingly low-level structures in farther distance from The Primordial Egg.</li>
<li><b><big>Sub physics #3 / Arrasverse object physics</big></b>: From the blueprint of Precise Verse Physics, arrasverse constructs its own set of laws made to fit more well to polygons, entities, and nests. For example, while gravity (gravity  and few only. other forms of attractions &amp; forces conducted by particles, including electromagnetism, works at least weakly or just fine like they are in other verses while gravity requires tilt in space and arrasverse cannot allow that.) will solidly refuse to work for polygons, causing them not to attract each other and spread all over the place. In arrasverse, gravity-equivalent of attraction attracts things together, but it is applied to every single bodies equally. So a feather can literally knock a person over, and things never get destroyed in the process of gravitational compression. It is just too weak. All things have same amount of attraction, only exception being The Primordial egg which acts under the law very similar to real gravity.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Main physics 4: Inner physics</big></b>: Suddenly, formation rate of polygons increase to extreme level. Huge bundles of them appear everywhere, collapsing into giant anomalous polygons. The battles between entities are most ferocious here, due to almost all of their bases existing in influence of Inner physics. The gravity and electromagnetic force become hundreds of times more powerful than <a href="/wiki/Universe" title="Universe">our universe</a>'s, allowing Primordial egg to slowly gobble up entirety of polygons falling into it from inner physics' influential region.
<ul><li><b><big>Sub physics #1 / Amplified verse physics</big></b>: By absorbing unfathomable amount of energy and distributing it all over the region, verse physics start to go on drugs. They not only have effect hundreds of times stronger than their normal state, in occasional burst in power, some of them even surpass small portion of Arrasverse physics. many weird verses are created at inner physics' influence region, verse physics rebelling against arrasverse physics which is unadaptable to energy level change and is fragile at extremely high-energy state.</li>
<li><b><big>Sub physics #2 / New particle fields</big></b>: Along with verse physics trying to take over the arrasverse, particle fields emerge from verse physics' help. They get very excited by energy of verse physics, creating a bunch of particles and <a href="/wiki/Protoverse" title="Protoverse">protoverses</a> even when energy flash is small. All the energy particles make some of protoverses explode into verses, pushing away arrasverse physics until it collapses back to become arrasverse physics. The chaos creates <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACPolygons">polygons</a> ad <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACPolygon_nests">nests</a> of them very rapidly, where entities frequently raid them in large numbers.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Main physics 5: Central physics</big></b>: With ungodly power of overlapping physics in hands, primordial egg twists, bumps and winds all sub-physics together to one, barely-functioning, messy physic. It is jumbled and unified pieces of physics that is at verge of falling apart at any time. And in some unstable areas, it actually falls apart and physics try to kill each other.
<ul><li><b><big>Sub physics #1 / Weak laws</big></b>: Separation from central physics fractionalize all numerical value of sub-physics. There are absolutely countless amount of Weak physics, AKA weak laws. They range from gravitation to particle formation, where many of them don't work due to laws not being able to support what each other is trying to do. They eventually divide into weaker physics infinitely, withdrawing all effect Weak laws had on arrasverse.</li>
<li><b><big>Sub physics #2 / Strong laws</big></b>: Sometimes, big chunks of working physics are spitted out by Central Physics. Those "big chunks" are Strong physics, AKA strong laws. They dominate over uncountable number of weak laws, building verses and sorts where they are no longer influenced by The Primordial Egg or any parts of Arrasverse.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Main physics 6: Protector physics / "Core stabilizer; sustaining Arrasverse"</big></b>: Last layer of physics is a pure, insane gravity. Primordial egg is under influence of protector physics; a physic that delay time to infinitely slow level. This is actually the most important physics law for Arrasverse, as it delays primordial egg's relativistic time to infinity, preventing it from instantly collapsing Arrasverse into nothingness. Disappearance of protector physics is disappearance of Arrasverse.</li></ul>

<p>"Polygons" are something from nothing. Physics of Arrasverse compresses space at random places, and when the compression is complete, the polygon is born. It is a shell of matter packing energy, the energy that every entities use to evolve. Which, polygons themselves evolve, from nothing but twist of physics granting polygon a chance to become greater.
</p><p>All polygons have their own inner components and physics (except crashers and splitter shapes, they are just AI robots and bomb containing bunch of them); they are a lot like common verses in that aspect. Except the fact that polygon's inner physics are too weak to influence the outside world that is Arrasverse. The physics generated by natural separation from inside and outside of polygon is completely negligible at square to hexagon level, and only dodecagons and above have inner physics functioning like actual verse's ones. 
</p>
<ul><li><b><big>Normal polygons / "Permanence descending from primordial egg to today"</big></b>: The "normal polygons" evolved from eggs. No, not primordial egg, but from spheres only with ability to evolve into polygons. They still evolve from egg, created by spacial fluctuation. The theoretical limit to polygon evolution is infinity, but sadly, the polygon explodes into verse-shaking explosion once it reaches more than 20-side.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><big>Crashers / "Defender of nests"</big></b>: "Crashers", or "nest crashers", are special types of polygons engineered to defend the nest by literally "crashing" into entities. Most of the time, crashers are very weak, getting easily destroyed by entities and failing to prevent nest's obliteration by them. However, the story becomes whole lot different when crasher manages to kill even single tiny entity. Just like polygons, they evolve. And they become a crap ton stronger. Some of them spam ton of dangerous wall of strong barricade, while some rams the entity with immense speed. They are extremely diverse in kinds; new crasher is always being invented, and even the most common, successful ones are almost 10 in number. More details explained <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACPolygon_nests">here</a>, at "Nest Crashers" part.

In nest, they are created in large numbers. Single one of them is not even a tiny bit of threat to entities, since even the weakest projectiles can destroy basic crashers in an instant. However, the nest produces them in very large swarm, easily overwhelming almost all of weak entities. In contrast, evolving is not really beneficial for basic crashers; tier 1 makes them more durable but slower, tier 2 and tier 3 doing the same. At most of times, evolving is useless for basic crashers when hundreds of tier 0 are much more useful than single, strong crasher. In fact, basic crashers' evolution was product of mistake; an error made by first nests which made them require more energy to create single basic crashers.</li>
<li><b><big>Runner /</big></b>&#160;: Runners are relatively weak crashers relying on evolution rather than collectivity. Few of them can be created in group occasionally in the nest. Tier 1 and tier 2 of runner is basically useless, while tier 3 can deal heavy damage to dangerous entity that comes close to the nest. Tier 4 runners can take out a large variant of them, ranging from <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACShooters">shooters</a> to some <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACNaturals">naturals</a>. Later, this successful masterpiece of nest's evolution was recognized by naturals, and used runners as blueprint for the strongest <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACProtectors">protector</a>.</li>
<li><b><big>Collider /</big></b>&#160;: Colliders are slow but durable. If it manages to, well, collide with an entity, it delivers quite a punch. The group collectivity is nearly useless concept for these crashers; they only form with 3 or 4 companions if many, while in most cases, they form alone. Evolution is an extremely powerful tool for collider, because it becomes a lot more agile and strong every evolution. But most importantly, collider can split into smaller crashers upon destruction, with tier 1 and tier 2 focusing on quality, and tier 3 focusing on number.</li>
<li><b><big>Semi-crusher /</big></b>&#160;: Semi-crushers have a unique ability to carry other crashers in its empty space at the back. Crasher itself is strong but hardly benefits from evolution. However, by evolving into tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3, semi-crushers become extremely big and gain strong propulsion, enough to carry several mega-crushers and still sustain the speed of tier 0 semi-crusher. Tier 4 ones can carry multiple crashers by packing them like puzzle pieces, and tier 5 semi-crushers carry <b>another semi-crushers</b> all packed tightly in a pattern like snowflake. Combined with their ability to form in big swarm, semi-crushers can be a perfect soldiers defending nest flawlessly.</li>
<li><b><big>Kilo-crusher /</big></b>&#160;: Kilo-crushers are extremely hard; a result of hexagon-equivalent of material densely crammed together into relatively small crasher. And it gathers more density as its tier goes up. At tier 1 and tier 2, amount of material inside kilo-crusher jumps to that of heptagons and nonagons. Tier 3 shoves a decagon-equivalent of material inside kilo-crusher, but in return, the speed drops to painfully slow pace. Finally, tier 4 is explosive, obliterating most entities inside its burst range. The crucial weakness of kilo-crushers is that because of quality of kilo-crusher, the nest cannot create them in swarm.</li>

Their strength and hardness is comparable to that of actual square, and they form with <i><b>hundreds</b></i> of other companions. Instant siege from all side can obliterate absolutely any shooter getting locked on homing squares, and deals fatal damage to any other entities. Like normal crashers, tier 1 and tier 2 makes them slower yet durable (MUCH more durable in this case), and few tier 3 homing squares can massacre large group of shooters by surprise. In return, the energy required for nest to prepare and launch homing squares is so large (equivalent of total amount of energy extractable from decagon), that they are no more than final resistence weapon of nest.</li>

Each UV carries unique types of particles that cause various deffects like Torch, Chiller, Acid and Paralyzer weapons of Shooters. They are also extremely fast and has ability to "jump" long distance in no time. Especially strong ones are able to drill holes and shatter pretty much anything it wants, while emitting damaging particles wherever it goes. UVs' another advantage is sophisticated collectivity where larger and strong UVs can gather smaller and weaker UVs into small army to launch basic form of stratigic warfare. Because their only method is ramming, UVs are overall intelligent projectiles having ability to increase effectiveness of other projectiles. This enhancing mechanism was researched heavily by Polygonals, resulting in invention of strong Protectors comparable to how Runners turned out for Polygonals.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li><b><big>Anomaly polygons / "There are <s>no</s> accidents"</big></b>: Sometimes, intense fluctuation of space or energy in one place can destabilize polygon eggs. Their insides compress, slowly making alternations to its inner information. Depending on amount of energy applied to the egg, it can either get completely destroyed or dangle at exact border of destruction and stabilization. Egg in that state, surprisingly, evolves into another egg. That egg can be a seed for something wonderful, an excellent and revolutionary polygons all entities seeking them in hope for great discovery.
<ul><li><b><big>Radioactive polygons / "A superior abnormality"</big></b>: Radioactive polygons are like unstable elements of Arrasverse. They evolve from rare egg variant called "gem", a small hexagonal shape with a lot more energy than normal egg. Radioactive polygons tend to quickly evolve downward (decay) into normal polygon equivalent, or, as the word "radioactive" suggests, convert into a spectacular explosion.</li>
<li><b><big>Burnt polygons / "Fitful volcano"</big></b>: Burnt polygons are overall similar to radioactive polygons, except they evolve from another egg variant called "jewel". It holds even more energy than normal decagon, and is twice bigger than normal square, while burnt polygons themselves are three to four times bigger than normal polygon counterparts. Burnt polygons release their immense inner energy in form of energy burst, shell slowly shattering and exploding like volcano; spreading hot fragments everywhere</li>
<li><b><big>Legendary polygons / "EMP polygons"</big></b>: Evolving from insanely energetic "Turquoise" egg variant, legendary polygons are basically crumbling down to death upon their birth. Possibility of locating legendary triangle and above is impossibly small; most legendary squares send out hilariously large burst before they have chance or something to evolve.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li><b><big>Special polygons / "God polygons arriving from outer force"</big></b>: Special polygons are powerful polygons holding the power equivalent to individual verses. They generally affect Arrasverse in bad ways, such as by entering it and exploding, breaking or messing with Arrasverse space, or by creating "parasite" verse inside Arrasverse. There are many ways they can form, each one involving violent force or just the right condition.
<ul><li><b><big>Influx polygons / "The moon is falling"</big></b>: At stable orbit right above Arrasverse border, Arrasverse physic creates tiny tiny polygons. They do not have to explode without full supervision from Arrasverse; they just keep growing and growing into massive polygons impossible in Arrasverse: the Influx polygons. They do so by absorbing huge amount of material radiating from Arrasverse's Perspective particle border. Eventually, they collide with other gigantic polygon. When this celestial event happens, both polygons begin free fall into arrasverse. Because of sheer acceleration from Arrasverse's attraction, Influx polygon directly enters arrasverse. Then they either explode or get destroyed by entities. Some influx polygons in Arrasverse's history were so massive, enough to blast half or entirety of arrasverse upon destruction.</li>
<li><b><big>Semi-Verse polygons / "Arrasverse physics = toys for these polygons"</big></b>: When influx polygons are destroyed by entering the arrasverse, its inside collapses into semi-verse polygons. Although semi-verse polygons are incomparably smaller than influx polygons, they are much denser and has few essential physics required to be called a verse. The division between arrasverse's space and semi-verse polygons are vague, leading to these polygons mixing arrasverse physics with it. In every single cases, semi-verse polygons' physics win and mixture of two physics can occasionally create non-functioning verse without clear border. Verses of this kind slowly fades away unlike one made by verse polygon, and becomes mish-mesh of nest and "glitched" space: undefined nests.</li>
<li><b><big>Verse polygons / "Universe in a pocket"</big></b>: This polygon variant is not made from egg variant. It is a literal verse. When <a href="/wiki/Protoverse" title="Protoverse">protoverse</a> hatches inside egg, the egg "implodes" in contrast to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEexefuB62c">what protoverse normally does</a>. Upon imploding, the egg leaves a polygon containing a verse with its individual physics. They can evolve, but most of times, they just shatter by their own magnificent energy, creating nests, a peaceful negotiation between arrasverse's physics and another very verse.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>The polygon nests are types of abnormal area, where certain polygons will be created directly, without evolving from egg. For example, inside "pentagon nest", eggs, squares, triangles and their cousins are not able to naturally form; only pentagons. Same with hexagon nest, octagon nest, and all other nests; they are special part of space where only hexagon, octagon, and all other polygons spawn. The polygons made in nests can evolve, and the nest quickly achieves complexity level of small verse with its polygon evolution. 
</p>
<ul><li><b><big>Formation of nests / "Twisting, bumping, and doing weird acts to Arrasverse"</big></b>: Nests come to existence when there is a verse polygon. It is destined to explode at some point of time, and when it does, its inner physics law is released into Arrasverse space. The physics law builds whole different verse for a brief time, before components of verse gets all faded away and all that's left is physics law determining the shape of verse polygon. This remaining physics law binds with Arrasverse's one, creating a regional effect where only the polygons equivalent to dead verse polygon can be made.</li>
<li><b><big>Nest defense / "Everything does not ask what is nest, but how is nest"</big></b>: The nest's "defense" is described in 5 segment measurement: <b>energy level</b>, <b>polygon evolution rate</b>, <b>polygon durability</b>, <b>nest crashers</b>, and finally, <b>polygon formation rate</b>. If any of these properties are below necessary (100%)(a tiny stabilization point where nest cannot be destroyed by any entity of average power), like low-evolution nests, they generally tend to get completely wiped out due to bypassing entities. On the other hand, nest slowly becomes semi-fortress when any of these "defense" points are extremely high. Single type of nest has unchanging defense value, that cannot be alternated by any inner or outer force. For example, all pentagon nests have same defensive score.
<ul><li><b><big>Defense measurement 1 / Energy level</big></b>: Energy level is probably the most essential part of defense, because energy level is entirely responsible for other 4 defense scales. With higher energy, evolution rate and durability of nest polygons goes up. Nest crashers and polygons spawn much more frequently, providing defense against threats. A bit like ultimate nutrient pill of nest in that aspect. High energy level is commonly found in nests located closer to The Primordial Egg, where fresh supplies of energy flows into the nest without any insufficiency. However, at same time, too high energy level might be a poison to some nests. When nest produce too much polygons, they all collide and shatter, leaving the nest exhausted and defenseless against entities. Or worse, self-destruction can happen. But this is not the case, because nests evolve when their energy level is too high. Explained in "<b><a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACPolygon_nests">Medium-evolution nests</a>"</b> part.</li>
<li><b><big>Defense measurement 2 / Polygon evolution rate</big></b>: Shortening evolution time of polygon is an important job of nest. High-quality polygon means it calls for more energy from physics, leading to chain reaction where other polygons in the nest evolve all together. What's even better is that it raises the chance of polygons evolving into "splitter polygons", a special type of polygons with few crashers stored in them.</li>
<li><b><big>Defense measurement 3 / Polygon durability</big></b>: The polygon durability is not that important for nests, but is extremely important trait for polygons. Without minimum durability, shells of polygons become so thin, that even squares burst from their inner energy rushing outward. A severe lack of durability becomes seriously problematic when it comes to nests very high in evolution sequence, because, as mentioned in explanations about <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACPolygons">individual types of polygons</a>, big polygons' shells are too thin to contain their inside matter and energy.</li>
<li><b><big>Defense measurement 4 / Nest crashers</big></b>: Nest crashers are like robot guards of nest. They are basically polygons with sort of circuit inside telling it to collide, or "crash", with intruder. In fact, Nest Crashers are as essential as immune system. Without Nest Crashers, nests are totally defenseless against entities, making the nest easy prey for them. In fact, types ad abilities of Nest Crashers are so diverse (to fend off basically endless types of entities), that they have <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACPolygons">their own bullet point explaining solely about them</a>. In far past of arrasverse, <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACNaturals">certain group of entities</a> borrowed the intelligence and ideal shape of crashers and constructed <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACShooters">whole new species of entity</a> solely used to defend nest and defeat <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACShooters">shooters</a>.</li>
<li><b><big>Defense measurement 5 / Polygon formation rate</big></b>: The quality of polygons does not mean anything if nest cannot even form 1 polygon in a billion year! The frequency of nest calling out for help to Arrasverse physics, is as important as all others in the defense list. The formation rate of polygons (generally) decreases if nest is high-level, and increases if they are low-level. This might sound outrageous that higher level nests are lazier than low level ones, but as mentioned in "<b><a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACPolygon_nests">Medium-evolution nests</a>"</b> part, higher nests consider quality of polygon more than quantity of polygon.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Low-evolution nests / "</big><small><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx55-ngn8n0">Can You Really Call This A Nest, I Didn't Receive A Big Polygon On My Pillow Or Anything</a></small><big>"</big></b>: If verse polygon's shape (and property) is square and triangle equivalent, upon death, the verse polygon leaves Low-evolution nests. The low-evolution nests hardly produce anything; their energy density is too low to act as a beacon for physics. The physics find almost no interest in low-evolution nests, leading to the nest barely being more crowded than space few diameter away.

Triangles form noticeably actively inside triangle nests, but they rarely evolve into beta and alpha triangles because the nest's energy level is poor.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Medium-evolution nests / "Polygonal universe"</big></b>: Although it is very much possible for pentagon to decagon equivalent of verse polygon to explode and form medium-evolution nests, it is very much impossible if viewed from any being with finite lifetime. Medium-evolution nest formation via verse polygons happened only once or twice during immeasurable lifetime of Arrasverse, and incomparably bigger portion of them originated from... evolving triangle nests. Yes, nests DO evolve.
<ul><li><b><big>Evolution of nests / "device overload; upgrading to Window 120"</big></b>: The overview explanation quote of this bullet point does good job at being metaphor of nest evolution; a ridiculous event not possible in terms of normal logic. How the nest(s) evolve is simple yet weird; if certain nest has too much energy packed in it, the nest evolves into higher nest. It means that, for example, square nests with too much energy can instantly evolve into pentagon nest. Same with all other nests. While this process does not sound like it makes any sense, but quite logical act when viewed from Arrasverse physics perspective. Energy forms polygon, and too much energy forms a lot of polygons. Lots of polygon means high instability, and Arrasverse does not like that. With bigger polygons, energy required to produce one of them is enormous compared to one or two polygons below, so if pentagon nest becomes hexagon nest, the total amount of polygon in the same area drops to much lower number. This is why nests evolve into next one, a logic which has another perfect metaphor: "quality over quantity".</li>

<p>At the center of Arrasverse, lies The Primordial Egg. The Primordial Egg is embodiment of Arrasverse's physical and spacial power; its mass is infinite, rotation velocity is infinite, and it generates ungodly amount of (Arrasverse equivalent of) electricity. The protector physic is basically only restriction made to The Primordial Egg, and prevents The Primordial Egg from releasing its power right into Arrasverse and causing "extinction event".
</p>
<ul><li><b><big>Formation of The Primordial Egg / "Time in reverse"</big></b>: The Primordial Egg's formation happened right after Arrasverse's birth from <a href="/wiki/Protoverse" title="Protoverse">protoverse</a>. When the Arrasverse physics were still being forged from celestial power originating from protoverse, the pressure applied to its center created very first physics rule set of Arrasverse. It was stable, the one that is now entirety of Protector physics. With the primordial heat of creation, Protector physics created 5 more rule set of Arrasverse. They all eventually differentiated into current Arrasverse, and there was tremendous first polygon born when 6 physics were still all mixed together; The Primordial Egg, the polygon that has seen it all.</li>
<li><b><big>Three properties of The Primordial Egg / "3D singularity"</big></b>: The Primordial Egg, in a way, is very oversized black hole-like object, having all the essential traits of it and being tremendously overweight. It has three important properties affecting arrasverse in bad ways, but not really intentional since The Primordial Egg is leftover of Arrasverse's creation.
<ul><li><b><big>Magnetic field / ≈3.1x Total Arrasverse</big></b>: The inside of The Primordial Egg is fluid. It has so much fluency, that it is practically perpetually moving. Gigantic flow of this superheated material cracks and churns entire primordial egg into vibrating sphere, generating magnetic field of ungodly strength. Every single things in arrasverse is bound to fall into The Primordial Egg because of its magnetic field, which is the reason why it has been growing ever since the formation.</li>
<li><b><big>Rotation / ≈1x Omniverse Rad. per sec</big></b>: The rotational speed of The Primordial Egg is beyond what arrasverse normally allows anything to be that speed, made possible by protector physics region's inside completely devoid of any physics. Although protector physics block most of energy radiated by The Primordial Egg's rotation, a tiny percentage of it gets through protector physics barrier. And the "tiny percentage" has enough power to produce weakening of its magnetic field, purely by generating new space by rotational energy (like <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAa2O_8wBUQ">how dark energy works</a>), pushing away falling objects away a bit.</li>
<li><b><big>Mass / ≈0.3 Arrasverse</big></b>: The Primordial Egg has 1/3 mass of whole arrasverse. It is responsible for partial breakdown of Protector Physics, and leaking of rotational energy (all in all good thing). If the protector physics did not delay the relativistic time of The Primordial Egg, an entire Arrasverse would have been nothing more than relic, remains around hilariously massive black hole.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Death of The Primordial Egg / "Deep down, Doomsday has already arrived</big><big>"</big></b>: What protector physics does is not slowing down the time of entire region containing The Primordial Egg, but surrounding it with infinite-slowdown time shell so outside sees The Primordial Egg as eternally young and ageless. But in the inside of time delay shell, the primordial egg has collapsed long before. Its ungodly power of final demolition just did not reach to outer shell, and when it does, the arrasverse will be disintegrated into cloud of high-energy particles shredding every verses and structures in its way.</li></ul>

<p>Entities are small to large "species" of natural / artificial intelligences. They group together to survive, and each groups commonly battle another. All entities have evolved throughout the history of Arrasverse, some advancing to godly level while some are unfortunate and incomplete relics of past. They have weaponized themselves and built fortresses around The Primordial Egg, ferociously fighting each other to dominate and harness the energy of The Primordial Egg. To control The Primordial Egg, is to remain as ultimate supremacy to all others.

</p><p>The most numerous and dominant species of entities are Shooters. They have gone through thousands of various evolution to achieve the perfect defensive and offensive properties. Individual one of them are pretty weaklings, only able to defeat 3 or 4 other entities at once. The story becomes different with large groups of them available. a troop of organized shooters, or large-scale raid, can perish absolutely any entity or group of it. 
</p><p>However, they are not omnipotent beings; their level of technology is still low or average compared to other species, and countless civil war has prevented them from uniting into groups of necessary scale. They take most of armaments from ruins of other entities, occasionally leading to misengineering which caused astronomical costs to Shooters; example being creation of Artificials.

<p>Shooters are NUMEROUS. They have ability to replicate, <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACHistory_of_Shooters">due to their first ancestor being an egg</a>. Their bodies are mostly round and little bigger than pentagons, while some Shooters evolved (their property of egg coded in them never truly goes away) to having square bodies, and sometimes triangle, pentagon, or bigger polygons. An example of Shooters' natural evolution can be observed in Invariant and Necromancer Shooter subspecies. 
</p><p>There are many subspecies division to Shooters, mostly involving non-round (polygonal) body or ability to create unique projectiles outside help of <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACTechnologies_6">technologies</a>.

<p>Shooters undergo relentless self-development and research, constantly developing better weapons and strength technologies. Most of development progress of Shooters come from other species' technologies, as their progress is always bit slower than they get by copying them and altering it so it fits Shooters' body.
</p><p>There were and are dozen major progresses Shooters have made, where each one of them delivered incomparably more power to Shooters. Each researches produced WIIIIIP!!!! :D 
</p>
<ul><li><b><big>SR I / Basic Shooter Weaponry</big></b>: Before the First Major War, Shooters were as weak as current-day Polygonals even with population surpassing every other entities in Arrasverse combined. Their only weapon was one: a basic, not-so-special cannon of mild reload, low projectile speed and firepower. Even though large numbers of early Shooters were still dangerous to any entity, considering they were all united by one origin back then, they were still easily overwhelmed by ungraspable technologies other species developed for eons. They felt need to develop new weaponry, to effectively fend against vast different entities.
<ul><li><b><big>SP-1 BSW / Doubled Barrels</big></b>: One of first research of Shooters was developing a technology, "Twin", and its branch. They had more focused firepower or coverage, while being easy to expand and develop on. A successful example is "Penta Shot" branch, that is used and researched even to current day. Twin and its improved model, such as Triplet or Twin Twin, had firepower of three or four Basic Shooter, focused in one line and effectively delivering steady, damaging barrage to anything. Hewn Twin and Hewn Gunner was later invented to give them coverage of wider angel. Gunner was later invented based on Twin, with decreased power of single bullet but much much higher reload. After Twin research into focused firepower topic, the direction shifted to coverage range. Triple Shot, along with Penta Shot branch was invented by effort of the research, which generated extremely effective duo with focused firepower Twin branch.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-2 BSW / Long-Range Shooters</big></b>: Called "Snipers", Long-Range Shooters got increased field of view in exchange for less reload. They proved useful in most cases where they could kill enemies from afar, but some with too much field of view at cost of reload was useless against everything but other Shooters. Although being a failure, they became basic blueprint powerful weapons: Osciloscope and Railguns. Osciloscope and its descendant technologies had immense field of view, larger than Primordials, the biggest entity of Arrasverse. However, their firepower was increased by few times, allowing 2 or 3 of them to effectively finish off any entity from the place where they cannot see them. Railgun branch did not have increased field of view, but instead they raised firepower of single bullet by tens of times and reload by three times, and few of them could do significant damage to any entity except Outer Entities.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-3 BSW / Bigger and Stronger Projectiles</big></b>: As danger value of Shooters increased over time, Polygonals engineered a fighting-dedicated species called "Protectors". They had everything; from strength of projectiles to durability. Simple Shooter weaponry could never penetrate them, eventually leading to invention of Pounder branch. Its main focus was quality of single bullet, albeit at slower reload. Further development of Pounder branch continued; not so long after the progress began, Annihilator and Decentralizer was invented. Their bullets could instantly kill weak Protectors, and with some protection, Protectors stood no chance. They shortly became useless after Polygonals improved Protectors and they started shooting swamp of projectiles, requiring a hybrid between Long-Range Shooters and Pounder branch. Steamroller, followed by "Planar (farther field of view)" and "Wrecking Ball (Steamroller with faster reload)" was invented, taking whole advantage of Snipers and Pounder to force Protectors out of invasion.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-4 BSW / Increased Rate of Fire</big></b>: "Machine Gun" branch was engineering meant to be foundation for future technologies. After a complete development of three weapon branch, Shooters decided developing useful technology early would grant them future advantges. That first development was Machine Gun and its branch. It had much faster reload than basic weapons, but accuracy as cost. A single one of them, might loose to even the weakest Artificials. A lot of them piled in one place, will gain victory over strongest Celestials. Machine Gun's barrage gets exponentially more efficient and strong when there are more of them, or other supporter Shooters. Not only that, they branch into most deadly weapons to be ever invented (beside Redistributor and its divisions) against entity: flamethrowers. Flamethrowers are Machine Gun firing insane amount of bullets at a huge cost of range. But once anything gets in their range, they get instantly penetrated by storm of hot bullets. Courser is most effective among Flamethrowers; quite a big range, impenetrable bullet swarm, and overall rate of damage done being closer to Redistributor than anything else.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>SR II / Crasher Weaponization</big></b>: Crashers are strong. Some instantly kills swarms of Shooters without much problem. Instead of developing advanced weapons themselves, Shooters deactivated Crashers and blended them into their technologies. Strength of weaponized Crashers were improved by tens of times, and diverse branch of Director (the first Shooter that launched weaponized Crashers) have been made to fend off all possible entities.
<ul><li><b><big>SP-1 WC-L / Overseer Branch</big></b>: A raw strength of improved Crashers could greatly damage or kill low-durability entities on its own, so the first Director branch focused on increasing the number of weaponized Crasher spawner to replenish their drones quickly in battle. They controled Crashers with force field extending from its center machinary of each Crasher launcher, somewhat limiting maximum Crasher number to little less or more than 10. a peak of Overseer branch's original purpose is Cartographer, a Director meant to have maximum possible barrels before controlling manetic field tingling together, twisting and failing. Overseer branch's development also made Probationer branch, a Director equipped in one or more Crasher launchers that launch exceptionally strong Creashers. Director's Crasher launchers were later implemented to many other Shooter defense force, giving temporary projectile umbrella and precision projectiles to them.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-2 WC-L / Cruiser Branch</big></b>: While Director branch struggled sustaining control over their Crashers, Cruiser and its descendant technologies produced many weaker and smaller Crashers following a force field, or rather line, that dissolves into little pop of radiation upon reaching end of force "line" aimed at someplace. These disappearing Crasher projectiles are called "swarm", and faster but lower durability variant of it is "bee". Arming Shooter forces with Cruiser's relatively weak but precise swarm or bee granted many advantages; for example, it could add more constant defense to Shooters with slow reload, mostly Sniper branch.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-3 WC-L / Spawner Branch</big></b>: By improving Crashers of Director and attaching few weapons on them, Spawner branch was made. It fixed a big problem of past Director branch struggled to solve: defending the main body while Crashers are attacking hostile entities. Their special type of Crasher, called "Minions", had far larger durability than Director's Crashers. Many entities that collides with clump of Minions melted in an instant. Although Minions were much slower than Director or other descendant technologies of it (due to projectile generators and launchers), they made it up by creating well-defenside bullet curtain. Spawner, being successful improvement of Director, have been improved many times; each one being powerful at battle large variety of entities with its improved Minion cannons. Still, as it is case for all Director branch, Spawner branch was weak in battles where multiple entities were coming at once. It had to be guarded by at least one projectile-launching Shooters to release its full efficiency and strength. The problem was soon solved in Heatseeker branch, a hybrid between all beneficial traits of Director and bullet launcher branch.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-4 WC-L / Heatseeker</big></b>: Crashers have advanced homing system, and applying them on projectiles have been attempted before. Although most of them failed, some barely-working methods proved to be super precise and could deliver fatal projectiles over a long distance. Eventually research reached a huge leap, and the technology of homing system was advanced enough to be applied on basically every single weapons already existing. For example, inaccuracy of Machine gun and spreading of Triple Shot and their descendents became extremely valuable when they got homing tech implemented. Wide curtain of bullets could attack from close to 180° degree with high firepower. Applying homing tech was not that valuable for other Shooter weaponaries since it only added little advantage.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>SR III / Engineering of Rammers</big></b>: Instead of shooting bullets, Rammers, well, rammed into enemies. Some had cannons for propulsion, and some had relatively large amount of it to get a minimum defense while they approached target. Most of rammers (mostly) do not have awareness; they are more of colliding war robots. Rammers essentially act as large and powerful bullet that became temporary shield, colliding and decreasing big amount of durability of enemy entities so other Shooters can finish them off easier. Most Rammers were invented based on those two uses, each one specializing in one subject and adapting to requirements needed to fulfill their job.
<ul><li><b><big>SP-1 Smr. / Size Change</big></b>: The origin of Rammers were Smasher, a mildly-sized Rammer with extra-damaging shell wrapped around it. A Smasher was relatively good prototype of Rammers, because its strong shell would do considerable amount of damage if it manages to go through bullets of entities. However, it was sort of not-so-specialized Rammer, meaning it could be used as projectile or bullet shield, but not especially good option for those jobs. Smasherception and Bonker branch was soon invented; Smasherception branch as an effective barricade, and Bonker as a smaller Smasher to dodge projectiles and collide directly with enemy. Mega smasher, Spike and Auger branch was not invented for neither purpose; it was an upgrade of Smasher in an attempt to improve it and actually make it be able to do both shielding and damaging. The goal succeded, and two powerful branches of Smasher is used to current day for many purposes after it was improved throughout the history.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-2 Smr. / Collision + Turret</big></b>: At some point, Smashers got turrets on them for self-defense purpose. Turrets were almost completely useless, not even being able to catch up with regeneration speed of other entities. To make matter even worse, investment of Smasher's center machinary's energy in turrets made them significantly weaker, some prototypes not even being able to sustain their shells via energy pressure and just simply let it go. Until further development happened, which made Turret Smashers (AKA Auto Smashers) have turrets at strength level of high-firepower Shooter barrels or higher. They could definitely self-defend, but also self-offend only by turrets on them.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>SR IV / Auto-Aiming Technology</big></b>: After the first civil division of Shooters happened, they separated into two different groups. Both side attacked in large numbers of troops, focusing on numbers than quality. Weapon technology that could precisely aim and win over groups of entities was researched at this time period, and it was invention Auto-turrets. The development eventually continued, and some Auto-Shooters that were incredibly strong were made. These later helped Shooters by a ton in countless battles over The Primordial Egg.
<ul><li><b><big>SP-1 Auto-T / Series of Auto Turrets</big></b>: Auto-turrets were auto-aiming cannons that provided more precision over target. Since Auto-turrets were basically the weakest and earliest type of Shooters' cannon with planted aiming tech, every single types of Shooter weapons could replace weak weapon of Auto-turret. Because Auto-turrets and Auto-Shooters were majorly produced during a war between Shooters where number was biggest problem for both sides, they mainly implented high-reload weapons (Machine Gun and Twin branch) into Auto-turrets, creating pretty effective wires of bullets. To compensate their weak bullet power, Pounder and Sniper branch Auto-Shooters came to existence. Together, they not only defended multiple enemies at once, but canceled out their weak points; high-reload Auto-Shooters creating bullet barrier to defend a group, while low-reload Auto-Shooters blended their damaging bullets into it. The duo proved to be deadly, and because both side developed Auto-turrets at relatively similar time period, the battle kept on for a long time.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-2 Auto-T / Revolutionist branch</big></b>: To use Auto-turrets' advantage to full while having firepower of standard weapons, Revolutionist was made by long effort of Shooters. By testing with a lot of prototypes and actually working models, the final design was a rotating ring holding two Auto-turrets while main body had a weapon firing while its ring constantly attacked enemy. Revolutionists entered the battlefield at near the end of Shooters' civil war, because they were the ones that instantly flipped the battle progress and ended the war. A specific branch of Revolutionists, Subverter and its descendant technologies (Deutrion, Circuit, Toolbent) proved to be brutally effective against fellow Shooters, especially Circuit, armed in shotgun-style Auto-turrets firing projectiles of unstoppable speed. A small team of Revolutionists could slaughter opponent Shooters' one whole base at ease, and they were not necessarily only effective at battles between Shooters. Circuit in specific had a happy accident at its engineering process, having firepower that won over absolutely any entity (at that time period). If the Circuit was easy to produce as much as other Shooter combatants, they could have already won over all entities except Outer Entities and dominate The Primordial Egg even without Redistributors.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>SR V / Base-Builders</big></b>: Power of Shooters were at its peak after the 1st Major War, where they reaped insane amount of profit to their species by playing behind a furious battle specifically between Eternals &amp; Primordials and Polygonals. The entities, such as Celestials, realized hidden, massive threat which was emerging organization and army of Shooters. They began a large scale siege, along with Protectors and Polygonals, on Shooters for the benefit of all Arrasverse residents. It forced Shooters to back off far beyond area necessary to even run the smallest device from energy of The Primordial Egg. Shooters responded with even bigger scale revenge, and celestials were striked back and had to retreat to their original territory. Victory of Shooters was based on new technologies solely made to support large groups of Shooters. They were useless themselves, but formed impenetrable fortress when many of them were collected together or stayed close to group of Shooters.
<ul><li><b><big>SP-1 Base-B / Trapper Branch Development</big></b>: Projectiles of Trapper guns was a long-lasting, well, traps, engineered to have a lot of durability and lifespan so it can act as bullet barricade. So-called "Mega-Trapper" branch launched something surpassing the durability of Decagons. There was close to no way for any opponent to destroy the strongest barricade temporarily making moving fortress. When enemies started attacking from back where there is not as many defending traps for Shooters, new branch was engineered. Auto-Trappers, Trap-Guard, and Contagion Trapper trees came to existence, and Tri-Trapper branch later joined the party. Former 3 kinds of Trappers could attack and defende at same time, while Tri-trapper and its descendant researches could set 360° trapfield.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-2 Base-B / Builder branch &amp; Survivalist</big></b>: Traps were great for defense, but their speed was so terribly slow, that it was practically impossible for no-gun trappers to attack something. Also, traps were almost disappointingly weak in all other branches except Mega-Trapper, and numbers of traps were needed to defend even a small region. Builders solved the problem by planting a simple, single-use propulsion engine inside Traps. These sorts of projectiles were called "blocks", and although the blocks became inevitably larger to contain the device, they later got more densely protected. Engineer branch, an improved Builders, had Auto-turrets planted on their blocks, an improvement inspired by success of gun-armed Trappers. Survivalist accomplished the goal of protection and attack to the finest; it launched a special and strong block with Trapper barrels instantly building small base, while guarding itself by shooting extremely damaging small blocks and strong bullets. Many celestials died to Survivalist weapon itself or army of Shooter protected by it in the war over each other's safety.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>SR VI / "Switcheroo" Branch</big></b>: A substance originating from the moment of all egg's evolution (aka invocation substance) could let Shooters evolve and devolve rapidly. By applying some smart mechanics here, Shooters engineered "Switcheroo" branch, a special army of Shooters who could switch into different weapons. This was both effective in battles between Shooters and entities and Shooters to each other. Switching to most effective weapon against enemy was extremely effective, and Switcheroos could theoretically win a battle against every single enemy. Later, more research was done to find a method to increase Switcheroo's efficiency even further.
<ul><li><b><big>SP-1 Swcr / Standard Switcheroo</big></b>: The basic principle of how Switcheroos worked was simple: a specifically engineered "invocation substance" was stored in special storage of Switcheroo. Each invocation substance contains precise information about what Switcheroo's weapon change into, and it was controled solely by consciousness and desire of Switcheroo. Invocation substance got more <s>potent</s> effective every time research was done, decreasing probability of accidantal error. Also, more <s>potent</s> effective invocation substance and smaller container allowed more types of them to be carried in body of single Switcheroo, leading to increase in diversity of weapons Switcheroos can change into.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-2 Swcr / Traverser branch</big></b>: At some point, morphing into exact counter of enemy became impossible. There was simply not enough space to put more invocation substance. Although there was a Switcheroo prototype which tried doing that and succeded, reloading the invocation substance after battle was painfully slow process. Instead, by briefly devolving into weaker weapon and choosing right evolution tree to reach the desired weapon, the storage for invocation substance became drastically smaller since required number of invocation substance container was little over 10 at maximum.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-3 Swcr / Adaptor Switcheroo</big></b>: Traverser branch and improved Switcheroo tech was great, but they still got instantly exterminated when their decision to evolution was a bit off; the result was fatal especially when fighting strong enemy like Celestial. Adaptor Switcheroo had ability to gather info about all the enemy's weaponry and the rest of work finding the right invocation substance was a job of its internal machinary. Unlike former 2 kinds of Switcheroo, Adaptor could remember and spread reliable countering weapon against the enemy (and of course, because it is one branch of Switcheroo, it could switch itself into most effective weaponry against enemy), and it had authority to control small, unconscious machine-made group of Switcheroo. This was beyond effective; any enemy that had its weapon info examined by Adaptor Switcheroo could not ever think about raiding Shooters, because it would get instantly erased by army of machine-made Shooters commanded by Adaptor switcheroo. The only bad side of Adaptor Switcheroo was its production rate. The time and effort needed to create single Adaptor Switcheroo machinary and weapon was too large for mass-production, and Shooters are working as hard as they can, similar to level of Sandman project, for mass production of smartest brain of Shooters.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>SR VII / Invariant Research</big></b>: "Tank's body is an egg, and can evolve into another if certain invocation is applied." It was the basic principle for incredibly efficient Switcheroo branch. By pure curiosity, a special invocation substance was later invented that could do more than changing Switcheroo's inner structure to fit an altered weapon. It made tank's main body itself, evolve. The expectation was hoping for stronger Shooter body, since even the weakest polygon, squares, were tens of times stronger than eggs. They were also few times bigger than egg, so it was possible that new body of modified Shooter could have more barrels on them. The hope was soon shattered into pieces; instead of being bigger and stronger, the result was smaller and only slightly stronger than original egg-base body of Shooters. A thin stream of hope led to triangle, pentagon, and hexagon bodies, but they only became smaller and slightly stronger each development. Although the experiment was thought to be a fail, it later was discovered to be extremely valuable; their speed limit was 3 or 4 times faster due to lighter weight, while having about 2 times health of normal Shooters. Most importantly, in opposite to Switcheroo, Invariant branch Shooters were very easy to mass produce.
<ul><li><b><big>SP-1 Invr. / Square Invariant Branch</big></b>: The main strength of Square Invariants were strong bee and high number of fragile but large number of weaponized Homing Square. Because it was not as small as Pentagon Invariants or lower, they had complex fusion of complex gun weaponry along with damaging bees and Homing Squares being a big support. As it's true for all other Invariants are, Square Invariants were (including 3 other Invariant branch) exponentially effective in groups rather than individual.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-2 Invr. / Triangle Invariant Branch</big></b>: Triangle Invariants had less size but more speed. They still had surface area about the same as Square invariant, however bigger area per one surface, so firepower approximately stayed the same. By attaching already-existing projectile launchers and few invariant-exclusive small-but-high-reload guns and swarm shooters, Triangle Invariants soon had more complex weapons than Square invariants; some of Triangle Invariants had astonishing power that is approximately equivalent to Elite Crashers, one of successful kind of Protectors. Combined with dashing speed and little bit higher durability, Triangle Invariants had shown their power in form of countless contribution during several wars Shooters have foughten.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-3 Invr. / Pentagon Invariant Branch</big></b>: When Shooters managed to reach 3rd Invariant development period, Invariant got significantly smaller than before. Pentagon Invariants had size about half smaller than Triangle ones, requiring smaller energy supply and weapons. A newely-developed weapons and essential parts were barely size of polygon square, and only 5 of them could be implented into Pentagon Invariants. Many of them had special type of weaponized Crasher, a pentagon-shaped and high durability, that could be produced slowly from Pentagon Invariants' main energy source. At some point, pentagonal weaponized crashers themselves were weaponized, compensating poor firepower of Pentaon Invariants' weak cannons.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-4 Invr. / Hexagon (gem) Invariant Branch</big></b>: Almost all Gem Invariants to ever be produced were all rammers; they were simply too tiny for relevent amount of ammo and weapons. Only extremely small, specifically-engineered barrels made for Gem Invariants were irreplacable option, and attaching large amount of them to exceptionally big Gem Invariants barely made them have more firepower than Square Invariants. The development of Gem Invariant-exclusive weapons were slow, obviously because Gem invariants were more of Rammers than actual attackers. However, those exclusive weapons later improved Gem Invariants' firepower by tens of fold. Desperate research of Shooters on Invariants was done lightning-quick, when Celestials developed weapons with incredibly high reload and damage. Invariants, specifically Gem Invariants were exactly what was needed.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>SR VIII / Four branches of inhumane warfare</big></b>: Shooters relied solely on physics related to eggs and polygons. When they discovered that Arrasverse is a verse suppressing co-existing physics laws of normal verse, their hunger to use the suppressed physics led to invention of four new Shooter weaponry branches. It was done by special machinary separating Arrasverse's physics from its original verse physics planted on new Shooters. Later, invention of these types of Shooters would be considered as the most brutal and unethical deeds of Shooters. It would later significantly contribute to unending hate of celestials toward Eternals and Primordials for sustaining their alliance with Shooters despite monstrosity they created, and ultimately to disobedience of Artificials and their division from them: first, most effective, and most brutal type of chemical weapons. The weapons melted, electrocuted, poisoned and frozen their enemies without mercy. However, it was something that drove Shooters to Central Axis Powers and to throne of winners at Invocation substance Major War.
<ul><li><b><big>SP-1 C-W / Torch Branch [Electromagnetic]</big></b>: Torch and its sub-technologies were first to be researched for weaponization of Standard Verse Physics. Electromagnetic force allowed existence of heat, and too much of it caused sudden burst of energy spreading molten shrapnel of target to all direction, AKA a thermal explosion (aka just normal explosion like TNT or sun). This was incredibly deadly; by attaching a generator that is capable of generating "photons" (basically the transmitter of Electromagnetic Force), a simple projectile could turn deadly. Photon would automatically get attracted to anything inside influential region of The Primordial Egg, through an invisible electromagnetic field bending with immense energy around objects of Arrasverse but never showing an influence because of Arrasverse's physics suppression. Photons automatically concentrated to bent Electromagnetic field, raising energy level of object, then dissolving it into its component particles. Only the process was much more violent than anything else except decay of <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACPolygons">polygons</a>.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-2 C-W / Paralyzer Branch [Electromagnetic]</big></b>: Altering the type of photone generated by machine used in Torch made it do no damage at all, but to immediately withdraw all energy from anything it touches. Every single photon made an object completely stop for a tiny, tiny moment, until a photon gave back its energy by transmitting it back. The photon was not really a thing to put effort to produce (duh), so Paralyzer branch wrapped their projectiles in swirling special-photon sphere that literally paralyzed anything for few second. In exchange, even Paralyzer's Machine Gun variant had less reload than Snipers; their quality of bullet was simply too high to be produced in large amounts. However, reload problem soon turned out to be not problematic at all. Just few Paralyzers as a support at battlefield completely prohibited movements of enemy projectiles and, rarely, enemy themselves.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-3 C-W / Acid Branch [Strong Attraction Force]</big></b>: Strong attraction force (a force keeping object together and not dissolve into whatever <a href="/wiki/The_Pre-Hierarchy" title="The Pre-Hierarchy">fundamental particles</a> it is made of) was especially effective physics to apply at projectiles. It drew material from anything very close to it, and exploded into powerful burst once reached criticality. Because there is no atom in Arrasverse, and everything were experiencing exactly same influence of Standard Verse Physics no matter their size or "mass", Project Acid's weapon prototypes were terribly effective at drilling holes into whatever they were ordered to destroy. On the other hand, Acid branch was ineffective at fightings in swarms. Lots of bullets would miss the target, and even if it hits, Arrasverse's property of applying same amount of Standard Verse Physics' effect would cause far less damage than to larger objects. Also, use of Acid and its branch technology was strictly prohibited at region where lots of Shooters were living, due to being highly unethical and being almost impossible to repair the damage done by those technologies.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-4 C-W / Chiller Branch [Weak Attraction Force]</big></b>: Like how Torch branch is based on giant field covering all objects inside Arrasverse, Chiller branch had its roots on using The Primordial Egg's invisible power. Arrasverse's Weak Attraction field, AKA hidden Standard Verse Physics field that transmits an attraction between individual things, was discovered to concentrate at the direction of object or energy's action. What this means is that if, say, a potato is being launched from a potato cannon inside Arrasverse, invisible field of Weak Attraction would concentrate in front of potato similar to how air is concentrated in front of flying object. Gluons (transmitter of Weak Attraction) could be produced in mass easily by using device on projectile like Acid branch, and gluons concentrating in front of object resulted in slowdown of object's motion. Chiller branch, at complete research, gave Shooters a giant advantage. Chiller branch's projectiles not only stopped even highest speed projectiles completely, but large amount of them firing at a strong enemy could basically paralyze them and stop all their projectiles. Which is actually what is driving Shooters to win in current 6th Major War, along with Redistributor.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>SR IX / "Redistributor" Plan</big></b>: Redistributor is an ultimate entity killer; it only needs one at minimum and ten at maximum firing to utterly devastate an enemy. Its bullets are superheated (to the level where the energy density is closer to Turquoise or The Primordial Egg than anything else), compressed Jewel, that is constantly produced inside generator planted in it. The generator technology and ability to compress them into stabilized form, was considered as a wondrous technological leap even by advanced species like <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACCelestials">Celestials</a>. For comparison, only few of Celestials managed to equip something equivalent to Redistributor weapons, however their projectiles barely surpass the minimum durability needed to destroy strongest Shooter subspecies. But Redistributor is never the best Shooter if alone, because it needs tremendous amount of time to produce and launch Jewel projectile. It almost always acts with other shooters, which makes it hundreds of times more deadly. Still, Redistributor's Jewels can be nullified by swamp of barrage, resulting in expanded investments of Shooters in Redistributor plan. The most notable one among three major ongoing sub-plan is "Sandman" project, an ongoing upgrade for Redistributor so it fires theoretically <i><b><u>infinitely-damaging</u></b></i> projectiles.
<ul><li><b><big>SP-1 Redist. / "Drainer"</big></b>: Drawing power from Redistributor's bullet and slowly converting it into giant region where effects of SR VIII Shooter weapons are applied can be, and is, terrifyingly effective. By attaching power converter mechanisms to Redistributor in right way, it can be converted to temporary hell generator when Jewel projectile dissolves into region covered in poison, flame, ice, and electricity. In close distance, Drainer can become instant killer, while it can be used as cold-blooded weapon of mass destruction. The Drainer is not yet out in battlefield, not only because it is horribly unethical, but because it has record of turning area around development and test ground into inaccessible land.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-2 Redist. / "Piercer"</big></b>: Right engineering grants Jewel of Redistributor explode into massive barrage of shrapnel once destroyed. This does tens of times more damage to everything than normal Redistributor, even destroying a Celestial at one shot. Like Drainer, Piercer's purpose is to release ungodly energy of Redistributor Jewel to compensate its inability to fend off multiple enemies or projectiles.</li>
<li><b><big>SP-3 Redist. / "Sandman"</big></b>: Unlike other two ongoing improving of Redistributor, Sandman sub-plan heads in completely different direction: increasing Jewel projectile's durability to hundreds or <i><u>millions</u></i> of fold to forge a trump card against <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACOuter_entities">Outer Entities</a>, <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACEternals_.26_Primordials">Eternals</a>, and <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACEternals_.26_Primordials">Primordials</a>. It basically grants Shooters the power equivalent or even supassing Celestials. Still, Sandman project has not shown any notable progress, and it is oldest ongoing sub-plan of any kind. Compressing Jewel THAT much only resulted in Turquoise, which is way too unstable to use as projectile. It is very likely that Sandman project will be left unfinished forever, considering even technology of Eternals and Primordials combined with Shooters' was not enough to progress the project even fraction of it.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Shooters would already have slain every single entities and take over the Arrasverse if they did not split into hundreds of different groups and sub-groups. Separation happened and is happening due to many reasons, example being disagreement to change in social structure. Many groups are scattered over different areas, some building astonishing fortress while some dissolved into chaotic mess where anyone fights another. Some gave up on colonizing The Primordial Egg, while some decided to rely on protection from single, powerful Shooter and stopped developing technologies. No group ever has an official name, and are unofficially called by their major acts.
</p>
<ul><li><b><big>Defenders / Moving in groups</big></b>: The most respected group of Shooters are Defenders. They are organized ally trying to protect Shooters from invasions of entities. What's different about them is that they only keep Shooters' natural territories, and never contribute to development of genocide weapons (torches and acid) or expansion of Shooter territory. Defenders have been developing technologies on their own, specifically engineered to fend off entities other than their own kind. Most notable ones are Dominators; extremely strong stationary forts that acts as offense and defense structures. And less known ones are Healer branch. The tech tree was developed by Neutrals and Defenders traded part of their army with Healer branch.
<ul><li><b><big>Main Tech 1 / Dominator Forts</big></b>: Because it is basically impossible to defend gigantic territory of Shooters with only moving army composed of few troops, Defenders engineered special type of Shooter: a Dominator, a basic building block of Defender fortress. They are half-conscious, and have insanely powerful weapons mounted on them. Dominators are placed in defensive orders to build very strong temporary fort, guarded by strong photon barriers to add defense. Those Dominator forts have Defenders' troop factories and supplimentary structures located inside, and also a bit of Sanctuary replica to make enough polygons for energy supply and to release extremely strong defense machine in case fortress falls.
<ul><li><b><big>Dominators</big></b>: There are about 9 types of Dominators, each holding different weapons for effective defense against all types of entities. Few of them can be carried by extremely strong engines at one time, and just 5 to 6 repetitions of carrying process builds basic template for Defender fortress. Here, Defenders researched about tactics of arranging Dominators in most effective pattern, to use each type of Dominator's effectiveness and synergy to maximum. Most tactics revolved around leaving "doors" to center of fort, and placing Dominators in pattern so they close or narrow the "doors" so enemy suffers maximum casualties. Few other tactics were used purely for offensive purpose, to reclaim injustly occupied territories.</li>
<li><b><big>Semi-Sanctuary</big></b>: Instead of having to go out and gather polygons for necessary energy, Defenders decided to study Sanctuaries whenever they teleported into right place. They had ability to produce truly endless amount of polygon, by containing and releasing force of polygon nest. Also, inner space of Sanctuaries were greatly larger than view from outside, allowing it to contain powerful Sanctuary Protectors as an emergency response. Defenders needed exactly that, and captured one of sanctuaries in a space where physics needed for it to teleport was disabled. It was Precious Sanctuary, which generated rare and energetic variants of polygons and eggs. This specific Sanctuary played a big part in defense of Shooters, and has provided Defenders with ancient knowledge of Polygonals hidden in Sanctuary.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Main Tech 2 / Hypercannons</big></b>: Because Defenders keep especially active relationship with main engineers of powerful technology, Eternals and Primordials, they got to engineer incredibly powerful weapons called "hypercannons". They require immense energy source, preferably Hexagons or higher polygons taken freshly from their nests. Or polygon nest, sometimes Sanctuary itself was needed for Hypercannon just to fire one shot. But once fired, it had power to overturn battle (most times entirely, but sometimes only temporarily), or even a full-scale siege commanded by strongests of Artificials. Of course, Defenders never used Hypercannons except when extremely important fortress was about to fall or Polygonals commited genocides on Shooters by sending their disciples.
<ul><li><b><big>Hypercannon #1 / "Primordial Core Blaster"</big></b>: At the beginning of 5th Major War, Artificials and Celestials launched largest attacks in the history of Arrasverse, with each army division composed of millions and millions of fighting forces. About quarter of Shooter's territory was demolished in an instant, and the first hypercannon was engineered. It required stupidly large amount of power to operate (whole polygon nest had to be grinded into it for single shot), and had almost no precision over a single target. It just blasted anyting in 10-degree-wide death ray, that was almost useless at long-range but lethal at closer distance. Albeit being completed in less than 1/100 of <a href="/wiki/OYC" title="OYC">OYC</a>, it yielded ungodly power and let Shooters push back Artificials and Celestials in no time. The hypercannon was improved countless times, and special lenses were added to control its precision. It is moved to right next of the second hypercannon to support its deadly precision with</li>
<li><b><big>Hypercannon #2 / "Judgement Ray"</big></b>: A second hypercanon uses Sanctuary's energy collecting mechanism to draw every single drop of energy from Icosagon formed by Spacial Distortion Machine at its center to load. It has most precision and range among all weapons Shooters ever invented, and it is engineered to be able to hit anything in Shooters' territory (and it is also engineered not to hit anything beyond Shooters' territory by Defenders). No entity can withstand otherworldly power of the strongest polygon, and even the strongest fortress made from hardest materials Arrasverse is a spec of dust compared to second hypercannon's energy. This is basically working Sandman, and masterpiece of most brilliant builders of the verse. Every single territory intrusion since the end of 5th Major War has been completely eradicated by "Judgement Ray", but it is starting to show its weakness; there are increasing number of attacks toward Shooters' territory after official declaration of 6th Major War, and this hypercannon takes days, weeks, or months to fully charge. Another hypercannon was invented to compensate its weakness, and it was one that was as successful as "Judgement Ray", or perhaps more.</li>
<li><b><big>Hypercannon #3 / "Assault Factories"</big></b>: Third hypercannon(s) are portable, and carries semi-fortresses with them. They move by using teleportation technologies Sanctuaries use (while Sanctuaries teleport to exact location it wants, "Assault Factories" often have teleportation error margin of 2 to 3 Sanctuary diameter), and 6 production sites (specifically engineered Spawners) ringed around their power source makes portable Dominators and Shooters. Their firepower from main cannon is incredibly weak compared to "Judgement Ray", but still can easily demolish troop of Artificials. When the projectile strikes target point, it draws space around it, disabling movement of anything near the strike almost completely. These hypercannons are placed at regions where defense is weaker due to natural factors, mainly high-level nest which largely interrupts photon barriers of Dominator fortresses to defend those regions. "Assault Factories" can use nests as an advantage, drawing its energy for their activities. Overall, they did perfect job at blocking large-to-medium scale siege(s), and later became very impotant when 6th Major war began.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Main Tech 3 / Completion of Artificial Project</big></b>: Defenders managed to trade some of their blueprints to Expansionists group for unfinished and abandoned Factories used in Artificial Project. Based on those Factories' structures, Defenders constructed sophisticated production system of correctly-engineered Artificials, aka Defender Artificials. Wide range of them are produced as border sentries or fortress keepers, and some of strongest Defender Artificials are kept inside central (semi) Sanctuary of Dominator fortresses. This way, even if the fortress is destroyed, there is still last defense remaining. So far, about hundred kinds of Defender Artificials are present.
<ul><li><b><big>ADP (Advanced Defense Platform)</big></b>: The branch contains 12 different types of Defender Artificials, each equipped with sield that has durability to hold back a focused shot of the second hypercannon (meaning it is stupidly hard). They have lots of extremely strong weapons to defend themselves and Dominators around them, but most importantly, they act as space mirrors to make hypercannon beams to fire in right direction (hypercannons are hilariously large. Even the strongest propulsion system in Arrasverse, the ones that <i><u>are currently being used for turning this thing</u></i>, cannot turn it by more than 1 degrees in 1 day). ADP Artificials have teleportation ability similar to that of a third hypercannon(s), so they can be ready in position whenever needed. Of course, these shields can also be used as a perfect barrier to protect the troops during battles. Combined with their fatal-strength weaponry, they are basically mini-forts but better than Base-Builders.</li>
<li><b><big>AOP (Advanced Overseer Platform)</big></b>: AOPs are engineered to be a replacement for Central Artificial, which turned out to be horrible mistake. They are semi-conscious and extremely intelligent, and act as center hivemind of their own army. They decide what to produce to properly defend Shooters around them after carefully examining environment, and has permission to develop semi-hypercannons to plant on themselves, and owns 3 or 4 Factories to produce their own troops, and are allowed to choose what produce between AAP, AWP, and ASP (sometimes Dominators to build a mini Dominator fort). AOPs are commonly placed in groups at important places for Defenders, because they can perform immediate and effective attacks against enemies.</li>
<li><b><big>AASP (Advanced Armored Splitter Platform)</big></b>: AASPs are many weaker Defender Artificials connected together. They have ability to split and rearrange into trillions of different Defender Artificials, and they also can think together (they have intelligence circuits planted in them) to develop strong weapons for themselves. Disbandable units making up AASPs are called "modules". Modules are commonly equipped with few weapons or are part of bigger weapons. Outer shells of Modules are exceptionally hard and clicks together when arranged together, giving a strong protection. More Modules are being produced as part of AASP army, new ones having more self-defense in addition of intelligence.</li>
<li><b><big>ASP (Advanced Sentry Platform)</big></b>: "Don't care how many of them die; there are always more" is basic principle of Shooter strategy descending from very first era. Or more precisely, while small number of weak ones are relatively easily destroyed, like swarm of bee, many of them pose a serious threat to any being. ASPs are easiest to produce, and even simple Spawner branches can be only slightly modified to have an army of 10 to 20 ASPs. There can be literally billions of ASPs controlled by single AOP or ADP, all usually composed of small base and few small arms. However, being mass-produced does not mean individual one of them are weak. Again, like the bee, they are still hard to kill because of their high durability and firepower about that of Shooters. And what's more, is that there are uncountably many number of variations. ASPs have basic replication system using eggs' mechanism, and any replication is meant to be slightly different from parent ASP. It makes ASP uniting in groups deadly against all possible opponents; even Celestial stands no chance when thousands of them swarm into one.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Expansionists / Living in well-guarded bases</big></b>: Expansionists, as the name tells, do exactly opposite of what Defenders do. They continuously expand territory of Shooters, and are biggest Shooter groups. There are separate kinds of Expansionists group, each fighting for their own profit and sometimes trying to kill other groups if that act benefits them. Almost entirity of Shooters' thousands of weapon branches originated from Expansionists, in effort to find the most efficient way of slaughtering. Also, Artificials were engineered by biggest of Expansionist group, when Celestials were at verge of wiping Shooters out even with effort of Defenders.
<ul><li><b><big>Base / Wireless charger for Shooters</big></b>: A base is sort of nest for all Expansionists group. It does not produce any polygons like actual nest, but has ability to interact Shooters' body to sort of give them constant energy and protection (as long as they are in their base). Different teams use varying bases each suited for their own body structure only. Currently, one of most hidden group of Expansionists managed to alter their bases to produce some precious, energy-dense polygons, for extra boost in research and evolution of their technologies. Unlike nests, bases are almost impossible to destroy; they are bound to Arrasverse's field itself, and removing base also means removing part of Arrasverse's physics along with base's area. They are generally guarded by dense forest of Rocks and Protectors.</li>
<li><b><big>Rocks / Netherite-hard Barricades</big></b>: Simply, Rocks are "dried" polygons. It is made by special machine that is able to withdraw as much energy as possible from polygons. Their insides are almost completely devoid of energy, and is close to the lowest energy level anything can achieve in Arrasverse. Even decagons in Rock state will not surpass radious of the smallest Celestial, because they are mostly made of energy and removing it only leaves polygon's hull. Those hulls are full of materials capable of absorbing incredible amount of energy; squares and eggs contain it the least, and largest polygons contain them most. When enough access energy comes in, Rocks grow into their original polygon state. Because of these reasons, Rocks are great for defensive and offensive purpose. For defensive, rocks can be placed all around Expansionists' bases. They will absorb any projectile, growing in size, closing in gaps between Rocks. For offensive, replicas of Weaponized Sanctuaries' cannon can be used. Enemy can do nothing to block fast-speed death bullet, because it will go through almost any defensive walls and will only grow and become more powerful the more enemy shoots projectiles to nullify it.</li>
<li><b><big>Protectors / Hive of diamond bees</big></b>: (disclaimer: these Protectors are not ones made by Polygonals. They are other ones) Protectors are stationary bundles of powerful cannons. They guard Expansionists' bases 24/7, and launches lethal projectiles at anything close to them except its own kinds of Expansionists. Their purpose is to char everything near Expansionist bases down so free energy goes to their Expansionists group. Protectors are nearly indefeatable for any kinds of Shooters, so they also act as a tool to prevent total annihilation of certain group. Many different kinds of Protectors are currently present, armed with strongest and most proud weapons of each Expansionist group.</li>
<li><b><big>Groups / Deadly engineers and fighters</big></b>: Expansionists account for largest population in total Shooter population, and there is no doubt they built incomprehensibly big structures and complex offense and defense system comparable/surpassing Defenders or other species. They are responsible for many of Shooters' total number of developed weaponry, and about thousands of most successful ones are Expansionists' work. However, they do not like to co-exist and peacefully live along each other, and major focus of them is profit of only their own group. Restless arms races and wars are happening between Expansionist groups, in an effort to surpass others. What they do have in common, is that they seek to venture into unknown lands and lead progress of technology forward. It is what they exist for, and their ancestor civilization was entirity of Expansionists who shattered into current state. In territory of Shooters, there are no single land without footsteps of Expansionists' ancestors; even Builders' fortresses have been conquered few times, uncovering their godly technology to outside world. Before the 1st Major War, civil debate splitted the civilization into hundred pieces.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Neutrals / Living in structures close to Black Holes</big></b>: After it is revealed that using normal verse physics in Arrasverse is possible, some of Shooters activated gravity and formed a "black hole"; not exactly made from singularity, but extremely heavy unstable object that draws objects closer to it, however it generates light near its event horizon therefore extremely bright. A black hole created by that process has similar energy output as The Primordial Egg at close range, letting Neutrals live close to black holes and thrive. However, most of Neutrals' living space does not last long. Although Neutrals have neutrality (duh) almost exactly same as how Sanctuaries are to others, black holes commonly get stolen by Celestials to feed their temporary replica of The Primordial Egg.
<ul><li><b><big>Black Holes / Technically White Holes</big></b>: Like it is mentioned above, Neutrals use powerful, specialized machinary to completely remove Arrasverse physics' interference to its original Verse Physics. The machine creates a space where Arrasverse's verse physics is all there is, and by putting large amounts of polygons inside it, the polygon lump collapses and "black hole" is generated. Ironically, black hole itself is pitch black as anyone would guess, but the darkness is obscured by bright light engulfing black hole completely. The light comes from event horizon of black hole, where Arrasverse verse physics allow Hawking Radiation process to happen incredibly fast. The light at its peak outshines explosion of Decagon, and eats away black hole. Throwing in some polygons into the black hole is everything needed to sustain it, and it basically provides insanely powerful energy source for eternity. One advantage and disadvantage of the black hole is that it can be carried easily by putting gravitational object next to it. This is good for Neutrals when they need to merge black holes together when they are at verge of exploding, but allows Celestials to easily take away black holes created from centuries of Neutrals' effort.</li>
<li><b><big>Power Source / Black hole harvestor</big></b>: Black Hole Harvestor is both generator for energy and habitats of Polygonals. They are rings and giant panels floating around black hole, locked in position because there is no gravity in Arrasverse (duh ._.). Energy sield, similar to something that defends Dominator fortresses of Defenders, envelop the black hole colony. The sield is generated by natural magnetic field of black hole, at the point where force is concentrated to maximum. Black hole colony is perfectly self-sustaining, equipped with Neutrals' production factories necessary to defend their home.</li>
<li><b><big>Special Technologies / Minelayer, Healer, Taurus, Dropship</big></b>: By harvesting giant energy from black holes and putting it in new weapons, Neutrals developed what would be impossible without their energy and techs. Neutrals armed in these weapons guard their habitat, constantly battling against Celestials and any others who seek to destroy their home and steal miraculous energy source. First of them are Minelayer branches. They place semi-invisible mines that explode upon contact with anything. Planting special device in mines made them spit shrapnels of many kinds, covering wide range of offense and defense. Next is Healer branch, and Neutrals desperately needed them because they were the most frequently attacked group, and aiding fellow Shooters was found to be as important as developing something like Sandman. While other weapons are meant to damage, Healers are the ones that repair damage. Third branch is Taurus, which is commonly considered as most marvelous invention of Neutrals. They have no attack delay; energy inside their machinary instantly forms exploding projectile at desired place. It made any enemy totally defenseless, although it took a long time to defeat it. Last and most underestimated invention is Dropship. Their projectiles have insane amount of gravity, and Dropship fires two in one set of that projectile so they rapidly orbit each other and create sort of bigger projectile. Theoretically, the projectiles can have what's equivalent to infinite penetration; nothing can stop them except destruction of projectiles via swamp of barrage. However, the development is still ongoing, and Neutrals have not achieved infinite penetration yet.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Builders / Living in traveling fortresses</big></b>: Builders live in extremely well-defended, self-sustaining fortress where anything has to go through strict process to enter or get out of it. Ones living in other fortresses are their only approved fellows, and any other connections are almost completely prohibited except occasional trade with Defenders. Technologies of Builders are fairly advanced, because they trade Defenders for their techlology and provided theirs in return. However, they could not assimilate to each other, because their main ideology is very different; Defenders work for protection &amp; preservation of species, but Builders try to disconnect any relationships with outer world as much as possible. This made Builders easily one of most hated groups of Shooters, filled with nothing but endless selfishness and accepting what only benefits themselves. (almost) No fortress of Builders has fallen throughout the history, because any other entity than Shooters, or sometimes Shooters themselves, got instantly eradicated by Builders' sophisticated defense system while trying to steal their godly development progress.
<ul><li><b><big>Builder Fortress</big></b>: Walls of Builders' habitats are composed of non-transparent cube-shaped blocks containing complex defense machines. At centers of those blocks, is where Builders keep their most precious information or facility. The blocks are nearly indestructible without very long security code, and energy required to crack it open (about 2.4% of "Assault Factories' " main cannon's one shot) would incinerate everything contained in it. Especially cared informations are stored in even harder blocks, and they are basically perfect at securing anything. Builder fortresses are built using these blocks, and some of them contain armory holding celestial power to prohibit anything from entering their bases and stealing precious discoveries.</li>
<li><b><big>Technology levels</big></b>: It is thought that Builders have reached technology level above Celestials, because there were bunch of battles where Celestials trying to invade Builders' fortresses using everything they could, and still lost. Only the second hypercannon managed to expunge Builder fortress completely, when especially active one tried stealing technologies of Defenders. Then it was just strength of Builder fortresses' blocks, and most of weapons they used at battles have been obscured completely. One fire from an unknown weapon of Builders instantly eradicated small troop of Celestials, and even severely damaged Eternals. There might as well be weapons that unleashes hell at place it is meant to destroy. Not much else is known about Builders' technological progress, since Defenders are only ones who receive something coming out of Builder fortress and even them (was forced to) agreed on contract to not expose anything of Builders. Punishment for breaking it was instant extermination.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Hiddens / Behavior not found</big></b>: Hiddens are known in cryptic name "hemispheres", and is thought to be the smallest among Shooter groups but most advanced. Their army and researches are something equivalent of Eternals &amp; Primordials, but they are so perfectly cloaked in corners of Shooter territory, that nobody has ever witnessed them in large action such as wars.  Their most active actions are occasional deplyment of DWP (Distortion Weapon Platform, uses power stored in space itself to operate. nothing else known) from unknown places, and once thought one of weakest of those DWP vessel easily charred down aggressive fortress of Builders in a blink of an eye, a record demonstrating how devastating their weapons are. Intention of this event is still unknown. Few sightings of Hiddens revealed that they seem to prefer using weapons that are something equivalent to Spawner weapons. One sighting proved existence of Polygonals in the Hiddens group, and the fact those Polygonals were friendly toward Hiddens made many of Shooters to examine every single territory of Shooters. However, this effort made no progress.</li>
<li><b><big>Others / Dissolved</big></b>: There are lots of formally-rich Shooter groups that has been assaulted or got their habitats utterly devastated by entities. Surviving members tend to end up in few places, where there are only one to few nests and almost no energy. They try to restart their group, but because their leftover members usually range from 2 or 3 at most, they are extremely susceptable to attacks and small battles between countless Shooters to each other never ends. Some of those area where members of dissolved group who were battling each other turned into separate Expansionist group.</li></ul>

<p><b>Total population: <big>1.263 million</big></b>
</p><p><b>Technological advancement level: <big>4 / Divine</big></b>
</p><p><b>Major enemy: Everything except polygons, Protectors, Celestials, and Sanctuaries.</b>
</p><p><i>"Long time ago, polygons except eggs evolved into sentient entities. They gained prosperity, quickly rising to major species under the protection of godly <a class="mw-selflink-fragment" href="#.E2.8C.ACCelestials">Celestials</a>. They built complex society, living in mutualistic relationship with everything else. The Polygonals came to existence. All was fine until Celestials were betraying each other and Shooters engineered undefeatable weapons against every other entities of Arrasverse. Polygonals were quickly wiped out. Few remaining Polygonals are battling for revenge or seeking to being a peace to Arrasverse once more. Some have fled into barren outer lands of outer Arrasverse, to reanimate the minds and bring back the glories of polygons to finest again... lol"</i>
</p><p>The Polygonals, in a nutshell, are born from polygons and is a group of entities that do everything to protect them. They <i><u>were</u></i> leading major species of entity before Shooters, and Sanctuaries <i><u>were</u></i> produced by them (technology of Sanctuary creation has been lost; only Protector technology remains). Many of Polygonals who survived from several siege by Artificials, are living in outer parts of arrasverse. Technology of naturals are main target for shooters, as they are unfathomably advanced beyond what Shooters could ever engineer. However, with so few of naturals alive, they are not much of threat; or rather at the danger of extinction.
</p>
<h4><span id=".E2.8C.ACGroups_2"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="⌬Groups_2"><b><big>⌬Groups</big></b></span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a title="Sign in to edit" class="mw-editsection-visualeditor" data-tracking-label="log-in-edit-section" data-action="edit-section" href="https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Falldimensions.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FArrasverse%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D13&amp;uselang=en" data-testid="log-in-edit-section"><svg class="wds-icon wds-icon-tiny"><use xlink:href="#wds-icons-pencil-tiny"></use></svg></a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Polygonal groups have no clear intention unlike Shooter groups do, but they differ largely by how much technological progress one managed to go through. About half of them have been eradicated completely by Shooters, including what was once the largest group of fled Polygonals ever to exist. Majority of Polygonal groups are closely bound by peace treaty, and a lot of their technological force goes to engineering weapons for eradication of Shooters; their natural enemy. The rest goes to protecting polygons and their self-defense budget is fraction of their technological power, but even that is enough to effectively block large-scale attacks. About 14 kinds of Polygonal groups exist, each with highest prority and intention to protect type of polygon they originated from, because they were all made to do that. Like Expansionist Shooters, quite a lot of Polygonal groups do not get along with each other well. Especially because they have separate leaders for each group instead of polled decision method like Shooters, who tend to get more opinionated on one side and fight others for varying reasons. They serve &amp; defend their ancestor polygons (for example, Perpendiculans preserve squares as much as they can) with all the care and love, and Protectors are results of these efforts.
</p>
<ul><li><b><big>Group #1 / Perpendiculans, square-originated</big></b>: Making up most of population of all Polygonals, Perpendiculans rely on heavy Crasher attacks and something equivalent to Shooters' Pounder branch. Their tactics are mainly composed of overpowering enemy by crushing from all sides, which is (currently) extremely effective to Shooters but worst strategy against Eternals. Technological progresses of Perpendiculans are actually slower than Shooters, and they are already being outnumbered and overpowered by Shooters. Although they are working hard to achieve next great leap of technology, they are likely to massively decline in population after extremely large attacks Shooters are planning on them. The reason why Perpendiculans' development is terribly slow compared to others, is that they are divided into basically what is groups led by individual leaders.</li>
<li><b><big>Group #2 / Tritians, triangles' guardians</big></b>: Tritians, one of smaller groups of Polygonals, are more of an observant and thoughtful group. They place efficiency above everything else, even leaving their ancestor polygons, triangles, unguarded if necessary (it's an immeasurably immoral in perspective of Polygonals, especially considering Shooters are killing countless polygons for energy). The group is generally organized and advanced, not making a single decision based on feeling like many Polygonal groups do. Even though Tritians are considered to only care about their heads from viewpoint of Polygonals, they are actually sympathic and logical groups comparable or even more than Defender Shooters. They made alliance with Shooters, but not all of them unlike Eternals &amp; Primordials do; they only befriended group of Defenders, and they persuade army of them to defend their territory in case of unjust invasion, and to help out other groups of entities in case of one-sided ruthless massacre. Tritians themselves do not normally order raids on entities outside of absolute necessary, but has technology level right below Shooters and are armed with bunch of deadly weapons.</li>
<li><b><big>Group #3 / Pentovians, pentagons' guardians</big></b>: One of oldest group of Polygonals to ever exist is Pentovian union, servants of pentagons and ones holding immovable grudge against all Shooters. They engineered killing machines to slaughter Shooters, examples being Guardians (type of successful Protectors) and majority of Protectors. They gather every single pentagons inside an impenetrable defense fortresses, and even in a full-blown raid of Expansionist Shooters to wipe out their existential threat could not destroy them. However, they have been constantly declining since their formation due to Shooters' nigh-endless waves of siege, and lost much of their territory. Now, Pentovians rely on newely-engineered Protectors for their defenses, since their power is no longer enough to guard themselves from Shooters. Also, Pentovians are group that befriended all of Polygonal groups by helping them whenever needed and accepting their opinions. Because of that, Pentovians are most respected Polygonal group among 13.</li>
<li><b><big>Group #4 / Hexens, hexagons' guardians</big></b>: Hexens are very active group. They contribute in basically every single business of Polygonals, from wars to species development Hexens have the strongest army among all Polygonal groups. The army is composed of thousands and thousands of Artificial-like troops, and they are growing incredibly rapidly in both weapon advancement and number; therefore it has lots of flaws due to rapid expansion. They send out their army to everywhere permanently and produces even more of them to replenish the missing places. This caused inorganization among Hexens, and few of Hexens are at verge of breaking apart. Every time the army goes to exterminate Shooters, they never acted together and made big losses every battle although they barely managed to win the most.</li>
<li><b><big>Group #5 / Septauruss, heptagons' guardians</big></b>: The most technologically advanced Polygonals are undoubtedly Septauruss. They have somewhat mutualistic relationship of giving others their technology and in return receiving theirs, with Defender Shooters. Septauruss always manage to improve requested technology to level never thought possible before, making them strong Polygonal group in both numbers (about quarter of Perpendiculans) and weapons. They constantly produce Shooter-style weapons, immediately engineering them whenever they feel the need for it. Submachine, Pelletter, and Lancer branch are the demonstration of how good Septauruss are at improvement of originals, a surprising success that came out when Defenders requested them to make new Shooter branches in 5th Major War, to effectively fend off overflowing army of Celestials and Artificials. Along with new deadly inventions (hypercannons) of Defender Shooters, new 3 branches showed brutal success, leading Shooters to win the 5th Major War. As technologically advanced they seem to be, Septauruss likes to punch things in the face. Lancer branch was an example of it; the branch used insanely high-energy "blades" generated by Shooters' inner power source as a weapon, instantly melting powerful barrage of projectiles and shredding anything the "blades" come into contact with.</li>
<li><b><big>Group #6 / Octriss, Octagons' guardians</big></b>: Protectors are mostly work of this group, the ones who have endless loyalty toward octagons. They like to oversee things from behind, and has never contributed to violence. Population of Octriss are negligibly low; former rich colony was wiped out by Builder fortresses' deadly attacks. Perticularily remarkable achievement of Octriss are hundreds of diverse Protectors, and mastering of physics modification. Octagon-based Protectors are the strongest among Protector species, and technology used by Octriss to produce them are still unknown, even to Polygonals. However, nobody knows where those Protectors are appearing, because Octriss hid from view after they lost almost all of civilization due to unexpected attack. Their habitats are thought to exist somewhere anyone can see, but hidden by perfect stealth technology. The power to bend Arrasverse in every ways granted many abilities never thought possible before, such as time control.</li>
<li><b><big>Group #7 / Nonilians, Nonagons' guardians</big></b>: Nonilians are extremely cruel toward Shooters, but are known for being friendliest to their own kind. They created special types of Protectors called "Phages" along with other powerful "Elite Protectors", and as the name tells, they are body-snatchers that benefit and replicate by draining its host. Fortresses and strategies of Nonilians involve extremely durable troops marching and destroying before they are destroyed. Being opposite to Perpendiculans, this is effective against Eternals &amp; Primordials, but tend to get easily wiped out whenever Shooters decide to annihilate Nonilians troops. They are obscure like Octriss, living in outer lands of Arrasverse. Population of Nonilians is proliferating at fast speed, and there exists as many of them as Tritians now. Similar to Tritians, Nonilians place tactical advantages above protection of their ancestor polygons, nonagons.</li>
<li><b><big>Group #8 / Deculuss, Decagons' guardians</big></b>: Deculuss suddenly disappeared after 3rd Major War, when offensive Expansionist Shooters engineered thousands of new lethal weapons and raided Polygonals at full force. They migrated to farthest lands of Arrasverse, and not much is known about them except the fact that they were engineering monstrous machine to accomplish the biggest achievement of Polygonals ever; something thought to instantly nullify all Shooters including Sandmans (if they were finished). It was a machine capable stopping the time of entire verse, but to incredible precision. Unfinished version is being developed by Polygonals, and several experiments have proven how powerful the machine actually is. Whole battlefield of Shooters were frozen in an instant at 3rd test, and Builder Shooters' fortress had no power when it infliterated into Polygonals' territory only to get instantly trapped in prison of time and be obliterated. However, like Sandman project of Shooters, the machine is always far from being done as if it was not meant to be done in the first place. In addition to that, the information went to Shooters, resulting in frequent damaging from Shooter infliterations in an attempt to stop their extinction.</li>
<li><b><big>Group #9 / Hendricans, Hendecagons' guardians</big></b>: A secret projects to defeat shooters are main focus of Hendricans, example being a project of cryptic name "Xyv Wdtcfgzsezgk", a fusion of 3 of Shooters' most feared Protectors and strong hendecagon. Hendericans' experiments and creation have been brutally successful against especially Defender shooters. At same time, those weapons were highly inhumane. But instead of sharing newfound territores equally to all Polygonals (sharing conquered territory is something that all other Polygonals consider as fundamental respect and do no matter how much they hate each other), they build industries and wicked labs. Inner structure modification and combination are their major experiment. Firstly, inner structure modification is basically experimenting with what's equivalent to brain and cells of subject to alter it so it becomes extremely aggressive killing machine filled with sort of stimulant tumors. Secondly, combination experiment is jumbling whatever Hendricans think will work the best, and just crams subjects into polygon filled with liquid that (hopefully) only draws subjects' best traits and apply it on surface of those special polygons. Xyv Wdtcfgzsezgk project is both 1st and 2nd type, a chaotic abomination that contains aggressive monstrous tumors (once was working Protector). No subject would want to volunteer for this brutal experiments, so Hendricans create random species of Protector for them. In summary, Hendricans are unfathomably advanced in bio-engineering, but are even worse than early Shooters at the field of projectile warfare. Wicked bio-modifications done by Hendricans is considered complete lunacy by all of Arrasverse residents. They are also greedy gourmet of energy, extracting every single drop of power from other polygons for their twisted experiments. Because they slaughter polygons for evolution, like Shooters, combined with their ruthless decisions, are hated by all other Polygonals.</li>
<li><b><big>Group #10 / Dodacantaurs, Dodecagons' guardians</big></b>: After Shooters started freeing Arrasverse's verse physics and discovered that it is very effective for weapon development, Dodacantaurs, one of if not most insignificant group in the time made incredible progress by studying Electromagnetic force especially. Their weapons, as a result, became based on laser-like mechanism capable of instantly melting and disintegrating enemy in a fraction of second. Dodacantaurs like to live in pitch-black parts of Arrasverse almost devoid of anything except their base and dodecagons. They are mainly lurking group that watches and silently tries to control situations to direction where they benefit Dodacantaur group by sending out supports to everywhere. Some say 6th war is being manipulated by them, however many believe they are not, mainly due to friendly (slightly disturbing) behaviors of Dodacantaurs. Although many naturals remain in friendship with immensely advanced group of Dodacantaurs, they all know something sinister is going on them.</li>
<li><b><big>Group #11 / Trididans, Tridecagons' guardians</big></b>: Trididans have achieved technological level right below Septauruss, meaning they are top-class advanced. While Septauruss use both damaging projectile launchers and melee attacks, Trididans use thousand different kinds of melee weapons and projectile launcher is their last focus. They act as trained assasins / infliterators able to accomplish any mission without mistakes for fellow Polygonals. Their social hierarchy is perticularily strict, each social class doing jobs assigned by Mastermind. It is an intelligent machine comparable to the Central Artificials. they made Mastermind when divisions were common among Trididans and Tridecagons were being slaughtered by Expansionist Shooters in abandoned nests. Trididans themselves are all partially made from machine, trying to enhance their ability by themselves. Their habitats does not exist; Trididans live in small, scattered groups accross the verse.</li>
<li><b><big>Group #12 / Tetrodians, Tetradecagons' guardians</big></b>: They immediately became extinct after they were born. only tens of them emerged during the climax of 1st Major War, and all of them has been wiped out by Shooters' raid on Polygonals before they could develop any unique relics to leave behind.</li>
<li><b><big>Group #13 / Penduluss, Pendecagons' guardians</big></b>: Only 10 of Penduluss are currently present, and each individual one of them has power of one, whole Polygonal group. They are close to actual gods of Polygonals, commanding an army created by their own power. Penduluss are able to hold celestial power because they appeared at approximately same time period as Celestials. They have not been revealing their presence until other Polygonals appeared, and briefly showed up in front of Celestials and asked for them to take care of Polygonals as much as they could. Penduluss stayed with Celestials for a while, sharing their above-5th class technologies and helping them advance. Penduluss left Celestials and went to their original pitch-black habitats. No entities other than oldest Celestials are aware of Penduluss' presence, and their intentions are still mystery except their occasional appearance spotted in the 6th Major War.</li>
<li><b><big>Group #14 / Hidden</big></b>: Similar to Hidden Shooters, there are Hidden Polygonals who have incomprehensively advanced technology and lurks behind all. They are even more advanced and hidden than Hidden Shooters, since only few members are expected to compose this mysterious group, and they have never been sighted. Their act of aggression in the past was elimination of Builder fortress, not one, but 3 of them wiped out in an instant. Sightings of Hidden Shooters associated with their actions and alliances with Hidden Polygonals suggest that they have purpose of eradicating Builders from Arrasverse, and not much else is known.</li></ul>

<p><b>Total population: <big>27.12754 billion</big></b>
</p><p><b>Technological advancement level: <big>3 / Advanced</big></b>
</p><p><b>Major enemy: Everything except polygons, Polygonals, Celestials, and Sanctuaries.</b>
</p><p>Protectors are sort of AIs made by Polygonals at early times of Arrasverse. Their only purpose is to defend what they are ordered to and drive non-welcoming entities to extinction, so they are basically holding immovable grudges against most of Arrasverse population. Protectors act a bit like immune system of polygons, except the fact that individual composers have basic level of consciousness and sentience to develop themselves to further levels. So far, Protectors are biggest threat for shooters. Protectors are mindless and emotionless when it comes to extermination of Shooters, and groups of them are strong enough to pulverize large bases of them.

<p>Subspecies of Protectors are divided by their creator Polygonal groups. For example, Protectors engineered by Perpendiculans are in different subspecies of Protectors than Protectors engineered by Septauruss. Weaponries are all different as well, due to creator Polygonal groups' preferred armory varying significantly from each other. Small and large Protectors can be commonly found in nests of polygons or bases of Polygonals, where Protectors patrol around them to eliminate any sus movement. Every single subspecies of Protectors except Crasher-based Protectors have so-called "beta" and "alpha variant", armed in additional weapons and acting as great hivemind of many individuals in one subspecies of Protectors. Also, all subspecies of Protector has so-called "Elite Protectors", a numerous, omni-purpose robot army units to fill up needed amount of force whenever Protectors attack. Aside from their unique turrets only present on certain types of Elite Protectors, all of them have Neutral Shooters' Dropship-style turrets but more advanced and are more like random-trajectory guided missiles. Also, all of Protector subspecies have nest-containing generators where gigantic amount of specially made homing polygons (they spit out polygon that certain Protector is based on. For example, Square Protectors shoot homing squares while Hendecagon Protectors shoot homing hendecagons) come out of. 
</p>
<ul><li><b><big>Square~Pentagon Protectors</big></b>: The most basic types of Protectors are the ones built from templates of most basic polygons: squares, triangles, and pentagons. Their main location is polygon nests, and they defend variety of polygons. Those Protectors are usually armed with modified Crasher summoners, and some take advantage of spray weapons and Auto-Aiming Turrets to cover up vulnerable points. Square to Pentagon Protectors like to act as small groups, mainly because they were not originally complex enough to sustain relationships of large communities. Individual Protectors of these kinds can only control troop of about 100 sentries maximum and 5 at minimum, which is not that strong among Protectors but extremely dangerous to any opponent. Strong variants are not much of a difference; just more weapons and ability to command some of normal Protectors.
<ul><li><b><big>Elite Squares / Engineered Homing Square based</big></b>: Elite Squares are the weakest of Elite Protectors, and are loyal to Square to Pentagon Protectors. There are 8 types of them that gets a lot more advanced artillaries as the evolution number goes up. Generally, Elite Squares can be divided into 3 categories; 1st are wrapped in guns shooting damaging storm of bullets, 2nd has a barrel replacing those guns that shoots extremely powerful and big bullets, and 3rd simply summon enormous amounts of Homing Square variants from mini nest inside them. Elite squares are well-known for being the most recently-invented Elite Protectors; they first appeared in 6th Major War which is still going on, and unlike other Elite Protectors,

<li><big><b>Square~Pentagon Protector Troops /</b></big>&#160;:</li>
<li><big><b>Square~Pentagon Protector Sentries / Composers of Constellations</b></big>:</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Hexagon~Nonagon Protectors</big></b>: With many sides to implant different weapons on and higher intelligence mechanism, these Protectors are much stonger and are able to command thousands of Protector Sentries. Planted weapons are suited for perfect defense &amp; offense on every side, say, by placing strong-bullet low-reload weapons and weak-bullet high-reload weapons in same or close sides. Sentries are now a big threat, and their firepower combined together can shred anything they seek to destroy. Commanders of those Protector Sentries are even more deadly, as they have extreme durability and powerful armory.
<ul><li><b><big>Elite Triangles / Special Runner based</big></b>: Sometimes, polygon nests create stronger or really unique variants of Crashers. One of them are "Red Runners" that occur pretty often, an insanely strong variant of Runner Crasher. Weakest Red Runners have durability closer to pentagons, and becomes harder than octagons when they reach higher tiers. Higher tiers of Red Runners were too complicated for even Polygonals to research and develop on, so they only managed to develop Red Runner of 1st tier into Elite Protector. Later, swarm of mass-produced 5 types of Elite Triangles were fixed to move according to commands of Hexagon to Nonagon Protectors, shooting deadly bundles of bullets and strong minions. What's special about Elite Triangles, is that they all have at least one kind of weapon that is involved with "spikes"; high-speed and ultra-damaging projectiles. They also have "Dropship" equivalent of weapons that are able to penetrate target effectively and damage them immensely in right conditions.
<ul><li><big><b>Elite Builder / Temporary Blockade main</b></big>: Due to need of strong temporary offensive and defensive bases at the start of 5th Major War, Elite Builders came to existence. They fired special projectiles called "Blocks", similar to Builder weapon branch that Shooters developed when they invented Trappers. Elite Builders have several of these "Block" launchers, and projectiles have a turret mounted on them which can wipe out individual targets (especially Shooters) in a blink of an eye. The only flaw that made Elite Builders not-so-effective on 5th Major War, is that their quality was far too high for mass-production. Reducing collectivity completely did not change anything; they were almost <i>too</i> perfect and well-made, generating really bad side-effect of low total numbers and overall no collectivity. They did a great job at destroying small Defender Shooters' fortresses alone, but were easily devastated when just a little bunch of Shooters' Smashers repeatedly collided into them.</li>
<li><big><b>Elite Inferno / Wide-spread main</b></big>: Elite Infernos have special armament called "Inferno" sprayers. Bullets that come out has a lasting effect similar to Torch, and speed increases by 2 fold every second it travels, dealing far more damage at farther range than closer. Normal Spike Sprayers on it gives perfect mid-range defense, and with other mounted turrets, Elite Inferno (used to) sweeps battles if enemy is based on numbers rather than qualities. 5th Major War was top time of Elite Infernos' efficiency, where Shooters raided in large numbers and got instantly eradicated by Elite Inferno troops. But they eventually turned ineffective when Shooters decided to put unfathomable amount of Smashers into battlefield. Smashers were too small, hard, and agile to be killed by Elite Infernos, while insane number of them swarmed and instantly wiped out any Elite Infernos and such. However, the problem was soon solved when new Elite Triangle branch was developed.</li>
<li><big><b>Elite Pelleter / Explosive Pellets main</b></big>: Elite Pelleters, also called "Keter Pelleters", are drenched in armory of explosive projectiles. The projectiles, well, explode when it comes to contact with anything, and explosion it generates instantly vaporizes all within radius of it. Because Smashers were causing massive amounts of problems by gathering at one place and colliding into Protectors in 5th Major War, Elite Pelleters delivered a huge punch to Shooters; its bullets were extremely damaging and destructive if one gets hit, and scattering Smashers over large area only made them more vulnerable. But most importantly, Elite Pelleters could deliver exactly same amount of firepower to any target within 360° due to its turret combination. Like how Gunships and Elite Gunners are made to instantly annihilate single target and focus on the next one, Elite Pelleters did a great job at both eradicating both number-based and quality-based attacks.</li>
<li><big><b>Elite Shotgunner / Area Coverage main</b></big>: By help of Septauruss, Protectors managed to get nigh-perfect tool for all opponent that may exist. Elite Shotgunners are covered in Shotgun-style guns, and they are both perfect at close and long range, and also for small and big targets. Elite Shotgunners' "shotguns" use a mechanism that splits Redistributor-tier of bullets into many small fragments; something similar to Piercer. The "Splitters" mounted on the shotguns can be temporarily unequipped for them to turn into Redistributor-like one-bullet-assasins. Unfortunately, Elite Shotgunners also were unable to be mass-produce due to their complexity like the case of Elite Infernos. Although they had more resistence against Smasher (Elite Shotgunners' bullet curtains are too hard for even a strong Smasher to properly penetrate), they were still vulnerable to Smashers. The next branch was dedicated to specifically targetting the Smasher and hunting them down once and for all, so Elite Protectors no longer had to suffer from Smasher attacks.</li>
<li><big><b>Elite Railgun / Fast &amp; Damaging bullet main</b></big>: Elite Railguns are master at sniping. They are always guaranteed to 1-shot-1-down the entities such as Shooters, especially annoying little Smashers. Not only Elite Railguns excellent in targetting, they are also great for close-combats. As the word "Railgun" in the name implies, individual bullet damages are excellent; insanely fast projectiles shatter through well-known strong armors, and Dominators of Defender Shooters are easy preys for Elite Railguns and their variants. Even better, "Railgun" weapons are especially great for destroying Dominators. These factors made Elite Railguns the last Elite Triangle protectors to be engineered while 5th Hemispheres, not because war ended shortly after it, but because they ended the war.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Hexagon~Nonagon Protector Overseers /</big></b>&#160;: E</li>
<li><b><big>Hexagon~Nonagon Protector Troops /</big></b>&#160;:</li>
<li><b><big>Hexagon~Nonagon Protector Sentries / "Division Sentries"</big></b>:</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Hendecagon~Tridecagon Protectors</big></b>: These Protectors are immense, and  All of them, especially Tridecagon Protectors are weapped in deadly arsenal launchers. Their total firepower surpasses the army of Protector Sentries they command. Sentries are not only ones that follow Hendecagon to Tridecagon Protectors, but they have authority and ability to control other Protectors similar to how Advanced Overseer Platform of Defender Shooters work. These Protectors are what makes Protectors be classified as individual species due to complexity level they can achieve.
<ul><li><b><big>Elite Pentagons / Modified Collider based</big></b>: Elite Pentagons, unlike other Elite Protectors, are each equipped with (micro-sized) Defender Shooters' "Assault Factory" main cannons that are shotgun-style turrets. Those cannons are able to charge different amount of energy to release varying types of bullet bursts. The turrets are not same for every Elite Pentagons; some deploy damaging mines while some launch impenetrably powerful bullet curtain pretty much more powerful than Redistributor, but all of their projectiles are short-lived. However, during their projectile bursts defend the main body, the turrets charge insane energy to control precision and power of their shot. This is basically what is different for Eliter Pentagons, since most of their 10 models are borrowed from the ones that already exist and are used by other Elite Protectors. Although they have artificial collectivity and commanding mechanism planted by Polygonals, it is still very imperfect and leaves Elite Pentagons vulnerable with only few tens of disciple Elite Protectors and hundreds of Protector Sentries at maximum. Due to these reasons, Polygonals are trying to further improve Elite Pentagons, giving them their own designs and weapons.</li>
<li><b><big>Hexagon~Nonagon Protector Overseers /</big></b>&#160;:</li>
<li><b><big>Hexagon~Nonagon Protector Troops /</big></b>&#160;:</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Crasher Protectors</big></b>: In an effort of Pentovians, Crasher Protectors came to existence just after the 1st Major War. By studying how nest Crashers work and taking their evolution-refined advantages, Crasher Protectors made enormous sucess. Not only they can be used as disciples of all Protectors, they are also durable and have bunch of exclusive cannons using their advanced shapes to construct lethal projectiles. Sentries are also not negligible; having the firepower equivalent to that of Defender Shooters' Advanced Sentry Platform, they easily match or outflank Defenders' Advanced Platform army.
<ul><li><b><big>Elite Crashers / Basic Crasher based</big></b>: Elite Crashers, like all other Elite Protectors, are made to fill up needed amount of force whenever Protectors attack something. Unlike other Elite Protectors, Elite Crashers have wide range of weapons, able to defend exponentially more variants of enemies when a lot of them are together. They also have complex collectivity originating from Basic Crashers', making them pretty deadly because their bond is closer to hivemind system used by Crashers, and not simple groups which can easily disband and leave individual members vulnerable. Only weakness of Elite Crashers, is that since they are built on weakest of weakest polygons (Basic Crashers are even weaker than Squares). Even a full-blown research of Polygonals and Protectors to increase Elite Crashers' durability did nothing, only weapons mounted on Elite crashers got stronger and stronger when Protectors improved Elite Crashers.
<ul><li><big><b>Elite Swarmer / Weaponized Crasher main</b></big>: Weaponized Crashers actually appeared before Shooters made them. Aside from Protectors themselves being weaponized Crashers, Elite Swarmer was engineered approximately at time when Shooters were barely finishing their project of engineering most basic weapons. Their purpose was to stalk Shooters using their ultra-large field of vision, because they were showing suspicious behaviors such as inflating their army size tens of times and suddenly developing technologies at full effort. When the 1st Major War started, Elite Swarmer played a big role at suppressing initial Shooter attack by striking them first and calling reinforcements. Elite Spawners were quickly engineered to follow Elite Swarmers to battlefield and give tactical support.</li>
<li><big><b>Elite Spawners / Weapon-mounted Crasher main</b></big>: Elite spawners are Elite Crasher branches that were meant to be enhancement of Elite Swarmers, launching much stronger weaponized Crashers, called "Sentries" (). Those Sentries had strong weapons mounted on them, and could fight head-to-head with individual Shooters. But their new technology was not enough to produce large amount of them; they ended up like Elite Crasher equivalent of Spawner Shooters, having few powerful sentries instead of minions and support from effective cannons. The 1st Major War was when Elite Spawners first appeared and evolved, achieving fantastic progress in the war by working alongside Elite Swarmers. Together, they evolved to maximum tier thanks to rush of technology originating from the war.</li>
<li><big><b>Elite Gunner / Concentrated firepower main</b></big>: When the 1st Major War ended, Elite Gunners were invented as 2nd type of Sentries like Elite Swarmers. Because Elite Swarmers has proven that first strike is advantageous, overwhelming amount of Elite Gunners were made to lurk in polygon nests to observe any sus behavior emerging inside Shooter bases. They were majorly different from Elite Crashers that came before; their main focus was immense concentrated firepower, inspired by Crasher Protector named "Gunship". Their huge frontal firepower was almost perfect against single target. Indeed, they became useful when several direct raids from Eternals and Primordials began, while leftover lurking force of Shooters who leeched on polygon nests. Eternals and Primordials were quickly taken care of due to extremely strong variants of Elite Gunners, being outnumbered and overpowered, a situation exactly opposite to what they expected from Protectors and especially number-first Elite Crashers.</li>
<li><big><b>Elite Sprayer / Bullet curtain main</b></big>: Elite gunners were great, but they soon turned out to be useless against Expansionist Shooters declaring 2nd Major War on all residents of Arrasverse (except their allies, of course). Protectors needed troops focusing on coverage rather than firepower; and that's why Elite Sprayers came to existence. They had giant amount of Machine Gun branch weapon called "Sprayers" wrapped around them, and they were able to lock on one target if needed. Elite Sprayers had both nice coverage and focused firepower, easily suppressing and expunging swarms of Shooters at ease. They were effective to almost every single Shooters except Pounder branch, making them quickly get large amount of technological investment from Protectors and Naturals. Elite Sprayers, along with other species efforts, successfully pushed Expansionist Shooters to losing the war.</li>
<li><big><b>Elite Destroyer / Lethal bullets main</b></big>: The 2nd Major War involved aggressive Expansionist Shooters launching giant attacks using semi-Dominators in retribution for allied attack on them centered around Celestials. Because semi-Dominator-made portable fortresses were very hard to demolish even for Elite Sprayers and Elite Gunners, development of new Elite Crashers were done by Crasher Protectors. Elite Destroyers, where their main weapons are strong bullets made to demolish Dominators in shortest time, had effective results when got protection from early Pulsar models. The two combination did great job at suppressing Shooter attacks for a long time, before they deployed newely-fixed Artificials against Polygonals and Protectors. All Protectors, including Elite Protector troops stood no chance in front of improved Artificials, and Elite Destroyers were wiped out in an instant. To prevent Artificial-Shooter ally attacks, two fresh Elite Crashers were developed.</li>
<li><big><b>Elite Launcher / Missile barrage main</b></big>: "Launchers", is basically weapon that shoots bullets that shoots bullets. By attaching vastly different combinations and kinds of turrets on the projectiles of Launchers, they can all be altered to become completely different from one another. Wrapping Launcher projectiles in countless barrels makes them shoot extremely coverage-efficient bullets, while some types of launchers like Catapult shoots Launcher bullets <i>that</i> shoots Launcher bullets <i>that</i> shoots bullets. Elite Launchers were special type of Elite Crasher with their own sub-categories. Since there were basically endless possibilities for Launchers, hundreds of Elite Launcher subcategories were mass-produced to win the 3rd Major War. The result was total success; mighty Shooters and their new Artificial army fell in front of impenetrable bullet curtains of Elite Launchers. When Shooters started copying Elite Launchers' technologies to build their own Launcher weapons, Protectors had already developed perfect anti-weapons: Elite Trappers.</li>
<li><big><b>Elite Trapper / Defensive projectile main</b></big>: Another special kind of Elite Crashers with their own subcategories are Elite Trappers. As the name tells, they are based on Shooters' Trapper cannons, and increasing durability of "traps" that Trappers launch and wrapping bunch of them on Elite Crasher turned out to be perfect anti-weapons for Launchers. Once (relatively) weak main projectile was destroyed, Launchers are harmless; but Shooters' Trapper technology was too weak to block Elite Launchers' projectiles while their own Launcher weapons were easily blocked by Elite Trappers' insanely durable traps. Not only Elite Trappers can destroy all sorts of projectiles including Launchers', they provide (almost)perfect temporary base like how Trappers of Shooters are made to do.</li>
<li><big><b>Elite Bases / Elite Crashers' commanders</b></big>: At the end of the 3rd Major War, Elite Bases were made. They are Advanced Overseer Platform equivalent of Elite Crashers, commanding huge army of them and armed in hundreds of lethal weapons to suppress and kill the enemy completely. Uniquely for Elite Crashers, Elite Bases are not symmetrical to any of their axis; all their sides can switch to different bundles of cannons by mechanism similar to Switcheroo-branch Shooters. Elite Bases and their (a LOT) improved versions took over all the land Expansionist Shooters has taken into their control, and even generated some surplus in the process. Although the 3rd Major War eventually ended, Elite Bases were left to orbit alongside other Elite Crashers over Shooter territories in case of sus movements. Their combined efforts to confine Shooters failed only 3 times in history. Elite bases are ultimate invention of Protectors and Naturals' combined effort to cease the war befor it got too brutal, and it marks end of Elite Crasher development.</li></ul></li>
<li><b><big>Collider / Collider based</big></b>: Collider (this Protector has same name to its Crasher counterpart) and its descendant Protectors are shields in battlefield, blocking the barrage of bullets by using their umbrella-shaped body best fit for reflection of projectiles. Mounted weapons and Crasher spawners add them extreme offensive power as well, and even the weakest of Collider Protector branch, the Collider itself, was strong enough to infliterate deep into enemy's base with its weaponized Crashers and Machine-Gun-like turrets. Being the first Crasher-based Protector to ever be engineered, it has lots of descendant Protectors. First one among those were Aquamarine, something made to form impenetrable walls of landmines while strong weaponized Crashers shred the target. It proved even more effective in defense however much less offensive power. The development in Collider Protector branch went on, and much more offensive Collider Protectors like Collision, Heptazoid, and Arrowhead came to existence. Collision had dense storm of explosive bullets, Heptazoid had intelligent minions, and Arrowhead had deadly clumping bullets which was not so easy to block and delivered quite a punch. Later, Hendricans made their own Protectors based on Collider, deformed biological abominations that ram into enemies while slaughtering them via their powerful turrets: the Fuêrons and the Asteroids. Fuerons were wrapped in turrets firing only insanely strong projectiles at slow rate, while Asteroids were made to "grow" their own weapons with their inner material, resulting in truly infinite possible Asteroids.</li>
<li><big><b>Gunship / Semi-crusher based</b></big>: Semi-Crushers' swift shape and the ways they move and gather by grouping behavior was perfect for creation of strong hivemind system of brand-new Protectors. The first Semi-Crusher based Protector, Gunship, had insane firepower concentration at single point where three deadly auto-turrets fire curtain overlap, and addition of strong minion producers and ability to strike along with few other Gunships made them perfect Protectors for basically every nest. And hostility was eradicated in an instant when the target provoked Gunships; they immediately concentrated all the available firepower into one spot, and even an army of Celestials stood no chance. After Gunships' collectivity and armory proved extremely sucessful, Hyperdrive and Minefield became Gunships' sucessor technology. Collectivity got tens of times more useful for them, mainly due to invention of Gunship Sentries, not only Gunship Sentries were already strong by themselves, now they were moving together in groups led by group composed of greately strong Gunship and their improvements.</li>
<li><b><big>Deltrablade / UV based</big></b>: UVs provide great particles that are able to be weaponized. They have effects very close to Shooters' Torch, Paralyzer, Acid, and Chiller, and Protectors acquiring UV-based army troops and Naturals protected by thosemade things a lot better. Deltrablade was Protector that quickly produced projectile-launching weaponized UV Crashers and launched them at high speed. UVs were engineered to be fragile, so its chance of exploding into deadly particles was highest. Deltrablade also had some minelayers for protection. This new Crasher Protector seemed to be annihilated by Shooters quite often; they were already masters at those topics and knew exactly what was needed to counter Deltrablade. Because Deltrablade's development was such a big achievement, Naturals and Protectors had no option of abandoning Deltrablade project but to further develpment.</li>
<li><b><big>Pulsar / Kilo-crusher based</big></b>: A seemingly-irregular arrowhead-shaped crasher, insanely hard in its durability but in return giving up its collectivity completely. This is Kilo-Crusher, the hardest Crasher to ever exist. And the hardness was temptating for Polygonals, but they could not find a way to research and build protector out of it; it was hostile to Polygonals since it only recognized shape of polygons, and every single containment and research attempt resulted in terrible accidants, where high-tier Kilo-Crushers broke out and returned to its nest while attempting to kill any Polygonal it sees. However, Polygonals made some progress by disabling the Kilo-Crusher and disassembling it into basic components. What they got is technology almost as useful as what Runners provided, a perfect template for strongest Crasher Protectors. Polygonals first engineered Pulsar and Magnetar out of what they have about Kilo-Crushers, and they were simple ramming machines to clear out the battlefield by ramming into enemies' bases. The purpose was to see if there is a part that turns Protectors against Polygonals. It was proven that Polygonals sucessfully got rid of Kilo-Crusher's self-defense mechanism, and the fact that newely-engineered Protectors were brutally effective. Even those simple rammers collided and severely damaged Defender Shooters' Dominator fortresses, allowing Polygonals to have three times more territories than before the 3rd Major War. Block was first to use Pulsar's template for real. The Block was more complex than Pulsar, and had significantly more damaging arsenals. Later, the Block became template for Snowflake and Octogem, a splitting Protectors that, well, splits into smaller Protectors to complete the former selfs' job. Other Kilo-Crusher based Protectors were Rammer and Traverser. Rammers are armed in special types of projectiles composed of energy and shell rotating around them: the Orbiters. They can be controlled by Electromagnetic field, and can be smashed into target to utterly devastate it. But most importantly, Rammers' Orbiters had thousands of possible size, property, and lethality all determined by how much energy is charged into Orbiter projectiles. Traversers are as fast as Meteor of Slider Protector branch, while super-precision turrets shoot out everything they see.</li>
<li><b><big>Slider / Runner based</big></b>: Runner-based Protectors are the most diverse, agile, strong, and the most successful development of Protectors. Sliders and their descendant Crasher Protectors are used in mass, shredding the target via swamp of powerful barrages and ramming themselves at full speed into enemies when they are about to break apart. Weaponized Crashers Runner Protectors generate are barely over the size of most eggs, but has all the durability of other Protectors' ones. As soon as the Sliders proved to hold immense potention for development, agility-based ones such as Sieges and Islands were the first to be made. They collided with subjects they were ordered to destroy, at same time dealing incredible damage using powerful weapons of theirs. First model of Vis Ultima improved turrets even further, focusing its two lethal turrets and one semi-hypercannon in one place to truly obliterate anything. Later, Slicers, Meteors, Eruptions, Bombarders, and Diamonds developed further in different fields of offense and defende. Slicers invested almost everything in ramming only, having needle-shaped form in netherite-hard tip. Meteors had less sharp shape but powerful booster mechanisms boosting them to ridiculous speeds; the boosters allowed Meteors to ram through enemies without resistence. Eruptions, on the other hand, concentrated solely on bullet powers. newely-invented "Flamethrower" weaponry of Defender Shooters has been stolen and implanted into new models of Eruptions by Pentovians, creating dense barrage of bullets in front of Eruptions almost impossible to penetrate unless attacked from the back. Bombarders held various trap launchers that could provide temporary fortress for Protectors. Finally, Diamonds were hybrid between Collider and Slider. They were shaped like very short arrowhead shape with trails equipped in guns attached to its main body. Most importantly, these trails could be separated, still operating even after Diamonds' main bodies died.</li></ul></li></ul>

</p><p><b>Major enemy: Sanctuaries are neutral, neither friendly nor hostile to anything</b>
</p><p>To protect polygons from other entities, Polygonals has constructed fortress of polygons. First step was giving tremendous energy to single egg and inflating it to level where nests could naturally form inside. Then naturals guarded them with strong crashers and specifically designed protector as an emergency system. Lastly, sanctuaries were given ability to draw energy from nearby environments and teleport to empty points of arrasverse's inner physics, so the sanctuary could thrive without disturbances from other entities. 
</p><p>First sanctuary was Egg Sanctuary, a giant egg capable of producing egg inside it, and evolving into higher sanctuaries containing higher level of polygons. Square, pentagon, and unstable sanctuaries started to appear, each producing different polygons inside it. At some point in time, Polygonals gave sanctuaries weaponry that could launch inner polygons at high speed. This was for two purpose; one was to give it a defense, and two was to spread polygons, so sanctuary left small colony of polygons before teleporting to other point in Arrasverse.

</p><p><b>Major enemy: Only Shooters</b>
</p><p>The most successful, at same time most unsuccessful invention of Shooters' efforts throughout the history, are Artificials. They are not conscious unlike Protectors (except the Central Artificial), and are purely guided by orders inscribed into their circuits. Albeit being invented by Shooters, Artificials are aggressive toward all of them and also to Eternals and Primordials who are ally to Shooters. At first, they were overturning the battles between Shooters and Celestials, and Shooters put more and more effort into Artificials in belief of defeating Celestials once and for all and being dominant species of Arrasverse. 
</p><p>But just at the moment Shooters completed engineering of Central Artificial ,a self-conscious center hivemind for every single Artificials, an unexpected happened. Central Artificial found more appropriate reasons to be on other entities' side than to help Shooters with all their thousands of sins. The Central Artificial improved all Artificials' weaponry and armaments by immeasurable degree, quickly outmatching Shooters and became major support for Celestials.

</p><p>Celestials appeared when first Polygonals were about to appear. They were forged from heat of Arrasverse's Big Bang, the time Arrasverse was hot everywhere and The Primordial Egg has just gained control of Arrasverse. Although Celestials came before Polygonals, their overall development speed was slower than them. However, instead of inventing newer weaponry, Celestials instead decided to focus on raising the power of them by tens of times. Even the weakest armaments of Shooters become deadly genocide weapons when combined with Celestial's ancient technologies. This placed Celestials at place right below Shooters, which is an incredible achievement considering Celestials are outnumbered by scale of millions. 
</p><p>Like Shooters, Celestials are also suffering from civil war. The biggest example of that is battle between Eternals (and Primordials) and Celestials. The war has been long and tiring for both sides, and slowly made Eternals and Primordials separate from Celestials completely. But thanks to all-out effort to develop strongest weapons, celestials have never lost a single battle against Shooters.

</p><p>Long ago, Eternals and Primordials were sub-species of Celestials. Extremely strong ones, in fact. They were former leaders of Celestials, who could not negotiate with their people over the peace treaty between Celestials and Shooters. From a long struggle, the strongest celestials (Eternals) and few leaders of those strongest celestials (Primordials) branched out, to build new civilization and declare themselves as separate species. Because some leaders on side of Celestials were also forced to join the new civilization, not every Eternals and Primordials were happy about everything. They secretly supported Celestials and some managed to flee to their side. The number grew along with amount of destruction Shooters caused to Arrasverse, and about quarter of Eternals and Primordials emigrated and became Celestials. Nobody could stop this, because restricting this behavior would only caused more to run away.

Although Outer Entities has never won a battle against Celestials, their unfathomable technology has successfully slaughtered Shooters few times since their division from them, looking for highly advanced individuals or groups to take one more step to absolute divinity.

<p>All Shooters share same origin: to the one egg that gained intelligence and consciousness to become first Shooter. It quickly replicated, and those first Shooters, without any defensive weaponry or bad relationships, soon evolved to learn about The Primordial Egg and they can possess what's equivalent to truly infinite power forever to their sons and daughters.

<p>They started engineering weapons to prepare for first raid on The Primordial Egg, and made alliance between Eternals &amp; Primordials (the leading power of Arrasverse) and Shooters. One advantage of Shooters was that they originated from eggs, a polygon made extremely frequently and can replicate close to exponential speed. Shooters made millions, then billions of themselves by easily building production factories based on how eggs work, each armed in simple but damaging weapons. In trust and support network built by first Shooters and Eternals &amp; Primordials, they began the raid on all bases of entities around The Primordial Egg.

<p>Shooters quickly overwhelmed entities not knowing about their existence, and built strong fortresses. WIP PART :DDD

<p>When Celestials raided Shooters and Shooters started engineering Base-Builders, there was Artificial Project that also was a major focus of Shooters. It was the most ambitious and great plan to ever be built by Shooters, advancing in progress incredibly fast, mainly from help of godly technologies of Eternals &amp; Primordials. First part of the project was an AWP (or Advanced Weapon Platform) plan, which was a plan to engineer powerful machines to respond to retribution of entities toward Shooters, especially retribution by Celestials. It was finished in less than quarter of <a href="/wiki/OYC" title="OYC">OYC</a>, and produced results with unfathomable success. Although the project was still in development and some weak and strong AWPs (most notably AWP-11 and AWP-39) were partially standing against Shooters, they had no time and deployed them anyway. 
</p><p>WIP PART :D
</p><p>At first, enemies at battlefield had no idea what brutal mechanism Shooters had just created from godly power hidden by Arrasverse, or rather considered them as weakest of because their visual look was no different from normal ones. Until one of them was suddenly converted into blinding expansion of orange mass. And then, nothing. First prototype of Shooters' research sweeped the battlefield, easily winning in a blink of an eye. Every species knew that Shooters stopped caring about ethics, and sparked a start of verse-wide union against Shooters. As mentioned in description about four newely-invented branches, Eternals and Primordials still kept alliance with shooters, and they became a target of hate and fear. Later, massive raid on R&amp;D site of Torch branch wiped out almost all Torch branch production factories, effectively stopping further development of Shooters in Torch and its descendant weaponries.

<ul><li><b><big>Egg-originated extinction / "The Primordial Egg is free"</big></b>: Sometimes, irregular burst of energy from very center of The Primordial Egg manages to break the barrier of protector physics. Of course, all hell broke loose upon the moments it happened. Although there are other huge wipeouts caused by other lethal objects or actions, Egg-originated ones were especially fatal. Whole Arrasverse collapses in front of unresistable power of entire Arrasverse's direct descendant, completely restarting with trace of information and entities kept alive inside pockets of Perspective Particles.</li></ul>
